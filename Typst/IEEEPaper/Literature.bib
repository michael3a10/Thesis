  abstract = {Background: Correct information provided by guidelines may reduce laboratory test related errors during the preanalytical, analytical and post-analytical phase and increase the quality of laboratory results. Methods: Twelve clinical practice guidelines were reviewed regarding inclusion of important laboratory investigations. Based on the results and the authors' experience, two checklists were developed: one comprehensive list including topics that authors of guidelines may consider and one consisting of minimal standards that should be covered for all laboratory tests recommended in clinical practice guidelines. The number of topics addressed by the guidelines was related to involvement of laboratory medicine specialists in the guideline development process. Results: The comprehensive list suggests 33 preanalytical, 37 analytical and 10 post-analytical items. The mean percentage of topics dealt with by the guidelines was 33\% (median 30\%, range 17\%--55\%) and inclusion of a laboratory medicine specialist in the guideline committee significantly increased the number of topics addressed. Information about patient status, biological and analytical interferences and sample handling were scarce in most guidelines even if the inclusion of a laboratory medicine specialist in the development process seemingly led to increased focus on, e.g., sample type, sample handling and analytical variation. Examples underlining the importance of including laboratory items are given. Conclusions: Inclusion of laboratory medicine specialist in the guideline development process may increase the focus on important laboratory related items even if this information is usually limited. Two checklists are suggested to help guideline developers to cover all important topics related to laboratory testing.},

Particularly, the detection of ammonia gas is very important for many industries due to its toxicity and environmental hazards. The hybrid nanostructures formed by blending of nanoparticles of metal/metal-oxides with polymer or its derivatives have been explored which showed improved gas sensing ability and selectivity at room temperature. This article reviews ammonia gas sensors based on semiconducting materials like metals, metal oxides, metal oxide-polymers and carbon nanotubes (CNT's) based hybrid nanostructures for different level of detection of ammonia in various applications. The characteristic performance parameters of these sensors, such as measuring range, sensitivity, selectivity, response/recovery time and the latest technological developments are discussed with detailed analysis in this article.},

But fluid flow controlling on microfluidics paperbased analytical devices ({\textmu}PADs) and post-processing on DMF devices have limitations. In this work a new hybrid paper-based device is proposed with the aim of resolving these limitations and expanding the microfluidics capabilities in point of care diagnostics. The hybrid paper-based microfluidics (HPMF) device is composed of a DMF device following a {\textmu}PAD in a single substrate, in which the DMF part performs the preprocessing steps of the test on droplets and transfers the resulting droplet to the {\textmu}PAD part of the device for post-processing steps. The fabrication process of the device is rapid and very low cost due to use of paper substrate and out of clean-room processes. The results show that the proposed HPMF device can perform droplet operations: moving, mixing, and splitting.},

In digital microfluidics (DMF), discrete droplets are manipulated by applying electrical fields to an array of electrodes. In contrast to microchannels, in DMF each sample and reagent is individually addressable, which facilitates exquisite control over chemical reactions. Here, we review the state-of-the-art in DMF, with a discussion of device formats, actuation physics, and biological and nonbiological applications. Along the way, we identify the key players in the field, and speculate on the advances and challenges that lie ahead. As with other fronts in the digital revolution, there have been and will be unexpected developments as DMF matures, but we posit that the future is bright for this promising technology.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidics is a popular tool for lab-on-a-chip applications and is typically implemented in one of two formats: single-plate (``open'') devices or two-plate (``closed'') devices. Single-plate devices have some advantages relative to the more common two-plate format such as faster mixing, the capacity to move larger volumes on a given footprint, and easier access to droplets for handling or optical detection. In contrast with the two-plate format, in which ground potential is generally supplied via a top electrode, in the single-plate format, many different geometries of ground wires/electrodes have been used. Until the present study, there has been no metric to determine which of these geometries is best suited for droplet actuation. Here, we present a combination of numerical simulations and experimental tests to compare six different single-plate designs. We applied finite element analysis, using the commercially available COMSOL software package to calculate the electrodynamic actuation forces in each of the different designs and used the results to optimize device design. Forces predicted by the electrodynamic model were in agreement with forces predicted using electromechanical models. More importantly, results were verified experimentally using a unique technique that permits indirect estimation of actuation forces on digital microfluidic devices. This work illustrates the promise of using numerical modeling to enhance the design and performance of digital microfluidic devices.},

This technology proposes considerable improvements in terms of experiment speed, configurability and consumed experiment materials. In this paper a novel pin-constrained digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) architecture is introduced for general-purpose assay execution. The proposed DMFB enjoys cost-saving of pin-constrained designs while providing general-purpose assay execution comparable with direct-addressing DMFBs and retains the same level of functionality as previous pin-constrained designs with lower number of electrodes and in turn lower number of control pins. The experimental results show that while reducing number of electrodes and control pins we managed to achieve the same level of performance; regarding number of electrodes 20 \% and 56 \% improvements were obtained compared with pin-constrained and direct-addressing designs respectively. Considering number of control pins the proposed design enjoys 3 \% and 572 \% improvements compared with pin-constrained and directaddressing designs, respectively. Furthermore, since the availability of various routing paths, the proposed design offers droplet-routing times comparatively lower than previous pinconstrained designs; the routing times were reduced by 17 \% and 23 \% compared with pin-constrained and direct-addressing designs, respectively.},

  abstract = {Magnetic nanoparticles have attracted significant attention in various disciplines, including engineering and medicine. Microfluidic chips and lab-on-a-chip devices, with precise control over small volumes of fluids and tiny particles, are appropriate tools for the synthesis, manipulation, and evaluation of nanoparticles. Moreover, the controllability and automation offered by the microfluidic chips in combination with the unique capabilities of the magnetic nanoparticles and their ability to be remotely controlled and detected, have recently provided tremendous advances in biotechnology. In particular, microfluidic chips with magnetic nanoparticles serve as sensitive, high throughput, and portable devices for contactless detecting and manipulating DNAs, RNAs, living cells, and viruses. In this work, we review recent fundamental advances in the field with a focus on biomedical applications. First, we study novel microfluidic-based methods in synthesizing magnetic nanoparticles as well as microparticles encapsulating them. We review both continues-flow and droplet-based microreactors, including the ones based on the cross-flow, co-flow, and flow-focusing methods. Then, we investigate the microfluidic-based methods for manipulating tiny magnetic particles. These manipulation techniques include the ones based on external magnets, embedded micro-coils, and magnetic thin films. Finally, we review techniques invented for the detection and magnetic measurement of magnetic nanoparticles and magnetically labeled bioparticles. We include the advances in anisotropic magnetoresistive, giant magnetoresistive, tunneling magnetoresistive, and magnetorelaxometry sensors. Overall, this review covers a wide range of the field uniquely and provides essential information for designing ``lab-on-a-chip'' systems for synthesizing magnetic nanoparticles, labeling bioparticles with them, and sorting and detecting them on a single chip.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Increasing demand for self-powered wearable sensors has spurred an urgent need to develop energy harvesting systems that can reliably and sufficiently power these devices. Within the last decade, reverse electrowetting-on-dielectric (REWOD)-based mechanical motion energy harvesting has been developed, where an electrolyte is modulated (repeatedly squeezed) between two dissimilar electrodes under an externally applied mechanical force to generate an AC current. In this work, we explored various combinations of electrolyte concentrations, dielectrics, and dielectric thicknesses to generate maximum output power employing REWOD energy harvester. With the objective of implementing a fully self-powered wearable sensor, a ``zero applied-bias-voltage'' approach was adopted. Three different concentrations of sodium chloride aqueous solutions (NaCl-0.1~M, NaCl-0.5~M, and NaCl-1.0~M) were used as electrolytes. Likewise, electrodes were fabricated with three different dielectric thicknesses (100~nm, 150~nm, and 200~nm) of Al               2               O               3               and SiO               2               with an additional layer of CYTOP for surface hydrophobicity. The REWOD energy harvester and its electrode--electrolyte layers were modeled using lumped components that include a resistor, a capacitor, and a current source representing the harvester. Without using any external bias voltage, AC current generation with a power density of 53.3~nW/cm               2               was demonstrated at an external excitation frequency of 3~Hz with an optimal external load. The experimental results were analytically verified using the derived theoretical model. Superior performance of the harvester in terms of the figure-of-merit comparing previously reported works is demonstrated. The novelty of this work lies in the combination of an analytical modeling method and experimental validation that together can be used to increase the REWOD harvested power extensively without requiring any external bias voltage.},

Integration is accomplished by having the DMF and the RF-sensing components share the same ground plane: by designing the RF-resonant openings directly into the ground plane of a DMF device, both droplet motion and sensing are achieved, adding a new on-board detection mode for use in DMF. The system was modelled to determine basic features and to balance various factors that need to be optimized to maintain both functionalities (DMF-enabled droplet movement and RF detection) on the same chip. Simulated and experimental results show good agreement. Using a portable measurement setup, the integrated CSSR sensor was used to effectively identify a series of DMF-generated drops of ethanol--water mixtures of different compositions by measuring the resonant frequency of the CSSR. In addition, we show that a binary solvent system (ethanol/water mixtures) results in consistent changes in the measured spectrum in response to changes in concentration, indicating that the sensor can distinguish not only between pure solvents from each other, but also between mixtures of varied compositions. We anticipate that this system can be refined further to enable additional applications and detection modes for DMF systems and other portable sensing platforms alike. This proof-of-principle study demonstrates that the integrated DMF--CSSR sensor provides a new platform for monitoring and characterization of liquids with high sensitivity and low consumption of materials, and opens the way for new and exciting applications of RF sensing in microfluidics.},

In addition, special featured reservoir electrodes are patterned to facilitate the droplet dispensing. In order to examine the effect of the reservoir liquid volume on the dispensed droplet size, several experiments are performed. The dispensed droplets obtained in the experiments are in the range of 80-370 Nano litter. The channel dimensions, the size of the reservoir electrodes and the channel electrodes are fixed. Increasing the reservoir liquid volume leads to a smaller dispensed droplet.},

  abstract = {Recent advancement in electrowetting technique has attracted the attention of researchers due to its numerous applications in lab-on-chip microfluidic devices. In the present work, an interdigitated electrode (IDE) configuration is introduced for producing oscillating droplets for heat dissipation in electronic devices. It resolves the problem of interfering wire used as an electrode in conventional methods of producing droplet oscillation. The dynamics of droplet oscillation and heat transfer effectiveness have been investigated for different voltages, frequencies, and droplet volumes. The time history of the instantaneous contact angle, contact radius, and height of the droplet have been analyzed for sinusoidal AC voltages. Moreover, oscillation dynamics with IDE configuration have been compared with that produced by the conventional method. The oscillation frequency of the droplet is higher in the IDE configuration than the droplet oscillation with wire. The frequency of the droplet oscillation is observed more than twice the applied frequency. The change in apparent contact angle increases with the applied voltage. In the presence of wire, the droplet exhibits translational behavior rather than oscillation below 20 Hz. The first resonant frequency of the droplet oscillation is reduced from 30 Hz in wire configuration to 10 Hz in the IDE configuration. The heat transfer performance of the oscillating droplet has been calculated from the time required for complete droplet evaporation with and without oscillation. Heat transfer performance is maximum at the first resonant frequency and decreases with an increase in applied frequency. The droplet evaporation rate decreases with the volume of the droplet, whereas it increases with the applied heat flux. The present work establishes that electrowetting actuated droplet oscillation over IDE can be implemented as an effective and scalable technique for cooling of hotspots in electronic devices.},

Hence, it is important to develop high-performance sensors that precisely measure nitrite concentration. Herein, the fabrication of a highly sensitive nonenzymatic nitrite sensor based on Fe               2               O               3               nanoparticle coated ZnO nanorods (Fe               2               O               3               NP coated ZnO NRs) is demonstrated. The ZnO NRs are grown on a seeded silver electrode by a hydrothermal method and then coated under optimized conditions with Fe               2               O               3               NPs using a dip-coating method. Detailed material characterizations and sensor fabrication process are reported. The electrochemical properties of a fabricated nonenzymatic nitrite sensor are tested with different concentrations of nitrite, which indicates that the coating of ZnO NRs with Fe               2               O               3               NPs significantly enhances the electrocatalytic activity. The sensor responds linearly with increasing concentration of nitrite from 1 to 1250 {\texttimes} 10               -6               m               with a high sensitivity (131.2 {\textmu}A {\textmu}M               -1               cm               -2               ) and low detection limit (0.015 {\texttimes} 10               -6               m               ). Moreover, excellent selectivity, stability, and reproducibility allow using these sensors for the determination of nitrite concentration in water with satisfactory results.},

  abstract = {A new microfluidic platform that integrates droplet and digital microfluidics to automate a variety of fluidic operations. The platform was applied to culturing and to selecting yeast mutant cells in ionic liquid.           ,                             Droplet microfluidics is a technique that has the ability to compartmentalize reactions in sub nano- (or pico-) liter volumes that can potentially enable millions of distinct biological assays to be performed on individual cells. In a typical droplet microfluidic system, droplets are manipulated by pressure-based flows. This has limited the fluidic operations that can be performed in these devices. Digital microfluidics is an alternative microfluidic paradigm with precise control and manipulation over individual droplets. Here, we implement an integrated droplet-digital microfluidic (which we call `ID2M') system in which common fluidic operations (               i.e.               droplet generation, cell encapsulation, droplet merging and mixing, droplet trapping and incubation, and droplet sorting) can be performed. With the addition of electrodes, we have been able to create droplets on-demand, tune their volumes on-demand, and merge and mix several droplets to produce a dilution series. Moreover, this device can trap and incubate droplets for 24 h that can consequently be sorted and analyzed in multiple n-ary channels (as opposed to typical binary channels). The ID2M platform has been validated as a robust on-demand screening system by sorting fluorescein droplets of different concentration with an efficiency of {$\sim$}96\%. The utility of the new system is further demonstrated by culturing and sorting tolerant yeast mutants and wild-type yeast cells in ionic liquid based on their growth profiles. This new platform for both droplet and digital microfluidics has the potential to be used for screening different conditions on-chip and for applications like directed evolution.},

  abstract = {In this paper, microdroplet evaporation in the closed digital microfluidic systems is studied for hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. The contact angle and contact radius are measured by an enhanced automated polynomial fitting approach. It is observed that the contact angle for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces remains constant during the evaporation process. However, a higher evaporation rate is observed for hydrophilic droplets compared to the hydrophobic droplets. Since no contact line pinning is observed, first, an analytical model based on the uniform vapor mass flux along the liquid--vapor interface is proposed. Interestingly, it is observed that in the hydrophobic case, the analytical model gives a higher evaporation rate, whereas for the hydrophilic case, the analytical model gives a lower evaporation rate. The discrepancy between the results of the analytical modeling and the experimental values is hypothesized to be due the constant flux assumption. To verify the hypothesis, a finite volume-based numerical model is developed to find the local flux along the liquid--vapor interface. The numerical modeling results confirm that for hydrophilic droplets, the evaporation flux increases very close to the three-phase contact line. In the case of the hydrophobic droplets, on the other hand, the flux decreases close to the contact line due to vapor saturation; as a result the uniform flux assumption overestimates the mass loss.},

The hybrid are synthesized through in-situ oxidative polymerization on flexible thin substrate. Synergetic behavior between both components manifested outstanding sensitivity (750.2 at 1000 ppm NH3) and quick response (95 s) and recovery (25 s) times and a lower limit of detection ({\textasciitilde} 45 ppb) at room temperature. The sensitivity of NiNPs@3D-(N)GFs/PANI hybrid sensor was shown to be about 14 times more than its of pure PANI sensor at 1000 ppm of NH3. The excellent sensitivity of the as-prepared hybrid is mainly originated from the substantial rise of hole-like carriers by NiNPs@3D-(N)GFs as well as improved intermolecule interactions via {$\pi$}- {$\pi$} electron networks. The obtained results revealed significant advantages for the synthesized hybrid sensor, making it a suitable choice for real-world applications of NH3 detection.},

A phase-fieldbased code with a dynamic contact angle model is used to study the droplet dynamics. Hydrophobicity of the substrate intensifies the deformation and internal flow structures of the oscillating droplet. It also influences the phase difference between the contact angle and the contact radius, producing three different phase regimes, i.e., in-phase, out-phase, and mixed-phase regimes. The amplitude and frequency of the droplet oscillation change differently with the surface wettability in different phase regimes. Moreover, a simplified analytical model is developed to correlate the maximum amplitude of the oscillating droplet as a function of static contact angle. The formation of convective rolls inside and outside the oscillating droplet is observed at low frequency, which is required in microfluidic mixing and heat transfer applications.},

SDB is a chronic disease that may lead to several health problems and increase the risk of high blood pressure and even heart attack. Therefore, the diagnosis of SDB at an early stage is very important. The essential primary step before diagnosis is measurement. Vital health parameters related to SBD might be measured through invasive or non-invasive methods. Nowadays, with respect to increase in aging population, improvement in home health management systems is needed more than even a decade ago. Moreover, traditional health parameter measurement techniques such as polysomnography are not comfortable and introduce additional costs to the consumers. Therefore, in modern advanced self-health management devices, electronics and communication science are combined to provide appliances that can be used for SDB diagnosis, by monitoring a patient's physiological parameters with more comfort and accuracy. Additionally, development in machine learning algorithms provides accurate methods of analysing measured signals. This paper provides a comprehensive review of measurement approaches, data transmission, and communication networks, alongside machine learning algorithms for sleep stage classification, to diagnose SDB.},

Therefore, the characterization and optimization of the interaction of chemical and biological solutions through microfluidic channels are vital for fluid flow design and engineering for quality assurance in microfluidic platforms. As the internal structures and kinetics of microfluidic channels are becoming increasingly complex, experiments involving optimal fluidic and transport designs are challenging to perform with high accuracy. However, highly integrated simulation tools can guide researchers without specialized computational fluid backgrounds to design numerical prototypes of highly integrated devices. In this study, a microfluidic chip with two inlet wells and one outlet well was fabricated from polydimethylsiloxane following which simulations were performed using an ANSYS Fluent tool influenced by computational fluid dynamics at a nearly identical scale. The pressure drop and velocity profiles of the interaction of two pH buffer solutions (pH 4 and 10) through the designed microfluidic chip were qualitatively estimated from experimental data analysis and validated with the simulation results obtained from the CFD-influenced ANSYS Fluent tool.},

In contrast to real-time PCR (qPCR), dPCR can perform quantification without requiring previous standard curve experiments. Furthermore, dPCR is more sensitive for rare targets in genetic samples. Despite the significant advantages of dPCR over qPCR, dPCR is not widely applied yet due to the complicated requirements of instrumentations regarding creating sample subvolumes and the equipment cost associated with this. In this paper, we present a microwell array that can be used for dPCR. The microwell array can be operated with little microfluidic expertise, while it can be manufactured at a unit cost of less than 1\$. The amplification results of the microwell array can be analyzed with a custom-written Python script. With this method, we have been able to amplify and quantify complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) samples for the H7N9 influenza virus in a concentration range spanning three orders of magnitude (1,000-100,000 copies/{\textmu}L).},

  abstract = {In this study, a surface acoustic wave (SAW)-based microfluidic device has been developed to separate heterogeneous particle or cell mixtures in a continuous flow using acoustophoresis. The microfluidic device is comprised of two components, a SAW transducer and a microfluidic channel made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The SAW transducer was fabricated by patterning two pairs of interdigital electrodes on a lithium niobate (LiNbO3) piezoelectric substrate. When exciting the SAW transducer by AC signals, a standing SAW is generated along the cross-section of the channel. Solid particles immersed in the standing SAW field are accordingly pushed to the pressure node arising from the acoustic radiation force acting on the particles, referring to the acoustic particle-focusing phenomenon. Acoustic radiation force highly depends on the particle properties, resulting in different acoustic responses for different types of cells. A numerical model, coupling the piezoelectric effect in the solid substrate and acoustic pressure in the fluid, was developed to provide a better understanding of SAW-based particle manipulation. Separation of two types of fluorescent particles has been demonstrated using the developed SAW-based microfluidic device. An efficient separation of E. coli bacteria from peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples has also been successfully achieved. The purity of separated E. coli bacteria and separated PBMCs were over 95\% and 91\%, respectively, obtained by a flow cytometric analysis. The developed microfluidic device can efficiently separate E. coli bacteria from biological samples, which has potential applications in biomedical analysis and clinical diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Human activities continue to affect our water quality; it remains a major problem worldwide (particularly concerning freshwater and human consumption). A critical water quality index (WQI) method has been used to determine the overall water quality status of surface water and groundwater systems globally since the 1960s. WQI follows four steps: parameter selection, subindices, establishing weights, and final index aggregation, which are addressed in this review. However, the WQI method is a prolonged process and applied to specific water quality parameters, i.e., water consumption (particular area and time) and other purposes. Therefore, this review discusses the WQI method in simple steps, for water quality assessment, based on two multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods: (1) analytical hierarchical process (AHP); and (2) measuring attractiveness by a categorically based evaluation technique (MACBETH). MCDM methods can facilitate easy calculations, with less effort and great accuracy. Moreover, the uncertainty and eclipsing problems are also discussed---a challenge at every step of WQI development, particularly for parameter selection and establishing weights. This review will help provide water management authorities with useful knowledge pertaining to water usage or modification of existing indicators globally, and contribute to future WQI planning and studies for drinking, irrigation, domestic, and industrial purposes.},

  abstract = {Low-cost and low-power nitrate sensor and sensing system are necessary for real-time water quality monitoring. A novel interdigital nitrate sensor for aquaculture is proposed in this research. The sensor is fabricated by applying the mould-based solution casting method. The electrodes are developed using Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs) and the substrate is formed using Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The sensor is characterized to determine various temperatures and nitrate concentrations by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). The developed sensor can detect and distinguish a wide range of nitrate concentrations from 0.01 ppm to 30 ppm. A wireless portable intelligent sensing system is also developed for water quality surveillance in real-time and receiving feedback from experts. A machine learning algorithm is used to train the microcontrollerbased system and determine temperature and nitrate concentrations in actual water samples. The sensors are compared with the standard UV-- Vis Spectrometry method for validation. The sensor and the sensing system's performances are highly repeatable reliable and stable to be a part of a smart sensing network for continuous water quality monitoring.},

  abstract = {Single-plate digital microfluidic devices offer a set of advantages over two-plate devices such as better mixing, the ability to move larger volumes, and easier access to the droplet. Currently, the non-floating configuration, where all non-energized electrodes on the device are grounded, is the most common electrode switching scheme used in single-plate devices. However, this scheme is limited by the symmetry of the electric field around the energized electrode, which can prevent complete droplet transport to the energized electrode for small droplets that can be seamlessly manipulated on two-plate devices. Here we present a numerical model to analyze the effect of droplet volume on the electrical forces generated on droplets actuated on single-plate digital microfluidic devices. We show that the commonly used non-floating switching scheme has a limit on the smallest droplet volume it can manipulate even if the droplet base diameter is larger than the electrode length; a condition that is currently believed sufficient for complete droplet movement. The model we built used Maxwell Stress tensor to calculate the electrical forces on the droplet to capture the effect of the grounding scheme more accurately than the contact angle change model. We used this model to analyze movability of droplets of various volumes and contact angles to find the minimum volume that can be successfully actuated. We also suggest better electrode designs that improve actuation of small droplets on single-plate devices and make their performance comparable to two-plate devices.},

Although extensive reviews of methods for foodborne pathogens detection exist, most are skewed towards bacteria despite the increasing relevance of other pathogens such as viruses. Therefore, this review of foodborne pathogen detection methods is holistic, focusing on pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and viruses. This review has shown that culture-based methods allied with new approaches are beneficial for the detection of foodborne pathogens. The current application of immunoassay methods, especially for bacterial and fungal toxins detection in foods, are reviewed. The use and benefits of nucleic acid-based PCR methods and next-generation sequencing-based methods for bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens' detection and their toxins in foods are also reviewed. This review has, therefore, shown that different modern methods exist for the detection of current and emerging foodborne bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens. It provides further evidence that the full utilization of these tools can lead to early detection and control of foodborne diseases, enhancing public health and reducing the frequency of disease outbreaks.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in the field of microwave planar sensors have led to a renewed interest in industrial, chemical, biological and medical applications that are capable of performing real-time and non-invasive measurement of material properties. Among the plausible advantages of microwave planar sensors is that they have a compact size, a low cost and the ease of fabrication and integration compared to prevailing sensors. However, some of their main drawbacks can be considered that restrict their usage and limit the range of applications such as their sensitivity and selectivity. The development of high-sensitivity microwave planar sensors is required for highly accurate complex permittivity measurements to monitor the small variations among different material samples. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to review recent research on the development of microwave planar sensors and further challenges of their sensitivity and selectivity. Furthermore, the techniques of the complex permittivity extraction (real and imaginary parts) are discussed based on the different approaches of mathematical models. The outcomes of this review may facilitate improvements of and an alternative solution for the enhancement of microwave planar sensors' normalized sensitivity for material characterization, especially in biochemical and beverage industry applications.},

  abstract = {Rapid, accurate and inexpensive monitoring of water quality parameters is indispensable for continued water safety, especially in resource-limited areas. Most conventional sensing systems either can only monitor one parameter at a time or lack userfriendly on-site monitoring capabilities. A fully integrated electrochemical sensors array is an excellent solution to this barrier. Electrochemical sensing methods involve transduction of water quality parameters where chemical interactions are converted to electrical signals. The challenge remains in designing low-cost, easy-to-use and highly sensitive sensors array that can continuously monitor major water quality parameters such as pH, free chlorine, temperature along with emerging pharmaceutical contaminants and heavy-metal without the use of expensive laboratory based techniques and trained personnel. Here, we overcame this challenge through realizing a fully-integrated electrochemical sensing system that offers simultaneous monitoring of pH (57.5 mV/pH), free chlorine (186 nA/ppm), and temperature (16.9 mV/{$\infty$}C); and on-demand monitoring of acetaminophen and \$5F ! ({$<$}10 nM), and heavy-metal ({$<$}10 ppb) {\~n} bridging the technological gap between signal transduction, processing, wireless-transmission and smartphone interfacing. This was achieved by merging nanomaterials, and carbon nanotubes based sensors fabricated on microscope glass slides controlled by a custom-designed readout circuit, a potentiostat and an Android app. The sensing system can be easily modified and programmed to integrate other sensors, a capability that can be exploited to monitor a range of water quality parameters. We demonstrate the integrated system for monitoring tap, swimming pool and lake water. This system opens the possibility for a wide range of low-cost and ubiquitous environmental monitoring applications.},

  abstract = {Implantable biosensors have evolved to the cutting-edge technology of personalized health care and provide promise for future directions in precision medicine. This is the reason why these devices stand to revolutionize our approach to health and disease management and offer insights into our bodily functions in ways that have never been possible before. This review article tries to delve into the important developments, new materials, and multifarious applications of these biosensors, along with a frank discussion on the challenges that the devices will face in their clinical deployment. In addition, techniques that have been employed for the improvement of the sensitivity and specificity of the biosensors alike are focused on in this article, like new biomarkers and advanced computational and data communicational models. A significant challenge of miniaturized in situ implants is that they need to be removed after serving their purpose. Surgical expulsion provokes discomfort to patients, potentially leading to post-operative complications. Therefore, the biodegradability of implants is an alternative method for removal through natural biological processes. This includes biocompatible materials to develop sensors that remain in the body over longer periods with a much-reduced immune response and better device longevity. However, the biodegradability of implantable sensors is still in its infancy compared to conventional non-biodegradable ones. Sensor design, morphology, fabrication, power, electronics, and data transmission all play a pivotal role in developing medically approved implantable biodegradable biosensors. Advanced material science and nanotechnology extended the capacity of different research groups to implement novel courses of action to design implantable and biodegradable sensor components. But the actualization of such potential for the transformative nature of the health sector, in the first place, will have to surmount the challenges related to biofouling, managing power, guaranteeing data security, and meeting today's rules and regulations. Solving these problems will, therefore, not only enhance the performance and reliability of implantable biodegradable biosensors but also facilitate the translation of laboratory development into clinics, serving patients worldwide in their better disease management and personalized therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidics allows for controlled droplet movement by applying AC or DC voltages. In this research, we investigated the dynamic contact angle variation of droplets at different voltages and droplet volumes in a digital microfluidics platform. Volumes of 10 {\textmu}L, 14 {\textmu}L, and 18 {\textmu}L were investigated with voltages ranging from 250 V to 400 V. The goal was to investigate how variations in voltage and droplet volume affected the contact angle, specifically by tracking variations in the advancing and receding contact angles. The findings showed that as voltage rises, the contact angle decreases more noticeably in terms of both advancing and receding angles. This shows that higher voltages boost the electrowetting effect and lead to better droplet dispersal and substrate wetting. Furthermore, it was found that across the studied voltage range, the effect of volume on the contact angle was largely consistent. The relation between voltage, volume, and contact angle in electrowetting is better understood from our analysis.},

  abstract = {Microfluidic-based biochips are replacing the conventional biochemical analyzers, and are able to integrate onchip all the necessary functions for biochemical analysis using microfluidics. The digital microfluidic biochips are based on the manipulation of liquids not as a continuous flow, but as discrete droplets on an array of electrodes. Microfluidic operations, such as transport, mixing, split, are performed on this array by routing the corresponding droplets on a series of electrodes. Several approaches have been proposed for the compilation of digital microfluidic biochips, which, starting from a biochemical application and a given biochip architecture, determine the allocation, resource binding, scheduling, placement and routing of the operations in the application. To simplify the compilation problem, researchers have assumed an abstract droplet size of one electrode. However, the droplet size abstraction is not realistic and it impacts negatively the execution of the biochemical application, leading in most cases to its failure. Hence the existing compilation approaches have to be revisited to consider the size of the droplets. In this paper we take the first step towards a droplet size-aware compilation by proposing a routing algorithm that considers the droplet size. Our routing algorithm is developed for a novel digital microfluidic biochip architecture based on Active Matrix Electrowetting on Dielectric, which uses a thin film transistor array for the electrodes. We also implement a simulator that allows us to perform the needed adaptations and to validate the proposed routing algorithm.},

In this article, we expand this vision with the goal of enabling everyone, regardless of their expertise, to use biochips for their own personal purposes. We developed OPENDROP, an integrated electromicrofluidic platform that allows users to develop and program their own bio-applications. We address the main challenges that users may encounter: accessibility, bio-protocol design and interaction with microfluidics. OPENDROP consists of a do-it-yourself biochip, an automated software tool with visual interface and a detailed technique for at-home operations of microfluidics. We report on two years of use of OPENDROP, released as an open-source platform. Our platform attracted a highly diverse user base with participants originating from maker communities, academia and industry. Our findings show that 47\% of attempts to replicate OPENDROP were successful, the main challenge remaining the assembly of the device. In terms of usability, the users managed to operate their platforms at home and are working on designing their own bio-applications. Our work provides a step towards a future in which everyone will be able to create microfluidic devices for their personal applications, thereby democratizing parts of health care.},

  abstract = {Conducting polymers (CPs) represent a sizeable range of useful organic substances. Their unique electrical, chemical, and physical properties; reasonable price; simple preparation; small dimensions; and large surface area have enabled researchers to discover a wide variety of uses, including sensors, supercapacitors, solar cells, batteries, biochemical applications, and electrochromic devices. To promote the success of CPs, unique composite materials have been prepared with metals or steel oxides. The goal of this overview is to characterize the electrochemical sensor utility of CPs and their composites and to categorize future components of electrochemical sensing materials. CPs have been comprehensively applied over a wide range of variable industrial fields; such CPs have used many new materials with diverse compositions that are utilized as electrochemical sensors and biosensors. These materials have been fabricated inside numerous analytical instruments that are applied in healthcare settings and clinical, environmental, food, and pharmaceutical laboratories. Electrochemical sensors are essentially based on CPs and/or their corresponding composite materials. Therefore, the present work provides a brief illustration of electrochemical sensor and biosensor applications for the most important conducting polymer composite materials. Polyaniline (PANI), poly(o-toluidine) (PoT), and poly(o-anisidine) (PoAN) were considered in this study. Moreover, the most important electrochemical properties of these conducting polymer composite materials are discussed.},

  abstract = {A fully automated microfluidic-based electrochemical biosensor was designed and manufactured for pathogen detection. The quantification of Escherichia coli was investigated with standard and nanomaterial amplified immunoassays in the concentration ranges of 0.99 {\texttimes} 104 e3.98 {\texttimes} 109 cfu mL-1 and 10e3.97 {\texttimes} 107 cfu mL-1 which resulted in detection limits of 1.99 {\texttimes} 104 cfu mL-1 and 50 cfu mL-1, respectively. The developed methodology was then applied for E. coli quantification in water samples using nanomaterial modified assay. Same detection limit for E. coli was achieved for real sample analysis with a little decrease on the sensor signal. Cross-reactivity studies were conducted by testing Shigella, Salmonella spp., Salmonella typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus on E. coli specific antibody surface that confirmed the high specificity of the developed immunoassays. The sensor surface could be regenerated multiple times which significantly reduces the cost of the system. Our custom-designed biosensor is capable of detecting bacteria with high sensitivity and specificity, and can serve as a promising tool for pathogen detection.},

  abstract = {Electrochemical techniques were successfully employed to estimate contamination of water of river Buriganga, Bangladesh. A Pt--Cu electrode has been exploited to measure selective nitrate concentration, and corrosion rate of iron has been proposed to indicate relative abundance of dissolved contaminants. In order to evaluate the pollution level, water parameters of river Buriganga have been compared with those obtained from two freshwater streams named Surma and Dawki of the country. An iron strip in contact with Buriganga river water is corroded three times rapidly compared to its contact with Dawki or Surma river water indicates acute contamination of Buriganga river water. The River Buriganga is facing acute pollution from the point of high TDS (0.664--0.694 g/L), low DO (1.47--4.4 mg/L), high COD (197--218 mg/L), high ammonia (270--420 mg/L) and high nitrate concentration (107--157 mg/L). Negative ORP value (- 292 to - 310 mV) of Buriganga river water indicates that the stream contains high level reducing species. Meanwhile, positive ORP value indicates that Dawki (+ 203 to + 209 mV) and Surma (+ 184 to + 205 mV) river water contain oxidizing species. Sediment analysis shows the deposition of disintegrated organic pollutants on the bottom of the River Buriganga. Cost-effective carbon material synthesized from taro stems has been proposed to restore water parameters of filthy water system like Buriganga river.},

However, fabrication of microfluidic devices is often complicated, time consuming, and requires expensive equipment and sophisticated cleanroom facilities. Three-dimensional (3D) printing presents a promising alternative to traditional techniques such as lithography and PDMS-glass bonding, not only by enabling rapid design iterations in the development stage, but also by reducing the costs associated with institutional infrastructure, equipment installation, maintenance, and physical space. With the recent advancements in 3D printing technologies, highly complex microfluidic devices can be fabricated via single-step, rapid, and cost-effective protocols, making microfluidics more accessible to users. In this review, we discuss a broad range of approaches for the application of 3D printing technology to fabrication of micro-scale lab-on-a-chip devices.},

The results were compared with experimental data and the results show good accuracy of the numerical simulation. Also, the stability of a droplet in a finite system was studied analytically and numerically (by LBM) and it was shown that the droplet stability is a function of system size and droplet contact angle. The simulation results were in good agreement with analytical solution and it has been concluded that in the finite systems an unstable droplet can be stabilized by applying a voltage (i.e., using EW). Based on this observation, a new method for droplets merging in finite systems has been proposed.},

  abstract = {Graphene has been a prominent choice as a base material for supporting varieties of inorganic and organic materials in scientific research and innovation due to its superior physico-chemical properties. Electrochemical sensors have been prepared by the use of a variety of nanoparticles and based on graphene which effectively supported on the surface of glassy carbon electrode through different methods. Graphene supported sensors have been utilized to detect and determine different electroactive species in samples. Many characterization techniques such as Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV--Vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) have been successfully applied to explore the properties of graphene supported nanomaterials. Applications of the sensors have been assessed using signals from electrochemical measurements such as: cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The results obtained from these measurements have data of wide liner range with small detection limit. Most of the results also clarified that the sensors were used to detect respective species with high sensitivity, and good stability. The electrochemical sensing of H2O2, hydrazine, dopamine, sunset yellow, flavonoids, caffeine, glucose, L-lactic acid, chrysophanol, etc., by graphene and graphene oxide-based nanomaterials has also been discussed in detail. This fact proved that there is a bright future for the development of portable sensors used in a variety of applications. The present review is focussed on exploring the synthetic methods, characterization and sensor applications of various graphene supported nanomaterials.},

  abstract = {Invasive Salmonellosis caused by Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi or Paratyphi A, B, C, or invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella serotypes, is an immensely important disease cluster for which reliable, rapid diagnostic tests are not available. Blood culture remains the gold standard but is insensitive, slow, and resource-intensive. Existing molecular diagnostics have poor sensitivity due to the low organism burden in bodily fluids. Commercially available serologic tests for typhoidal Salmonella have had limited sensitivity and specificity. In high burden, resource-limited settings, reliance on clinical diagnosis or inaccurate tests often results in frequent, unnecessary treatment, which contributes selective pressure for the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. This practice also results in inadequate therapy for other etiologies of acute febrile illnesses, including leptospirosis and rickettsial infections. A number of novel serologic, molecular, transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches to diagnostics are under development. Target product profiles that outline specific needs may focus development and investment, and establish benchmarks for accuracy, cost, speed, and portability of new diagnostics. Of note, a critical barrier to diagnostic assay rollout will be the low cost and low perceived harm of empiric therapy on behalf of providers and patients, which leaves few perceived incentives to utilize diagnostics. Approaches that align incentives with societal goals of limiting inappropriate antimicrobial use, such as subsidizing diagnostics, may be essential for stimulating development and uptake of such assays in resource-limited settings. New diagnostics for invasive Salmonellosis should be developed and deployed alongside diagnostics for alternative etiologies of acute febrile illnesses to improve targeted use of antibiotics.},

Superb control of the volume, uniformity, and generation rate of droplets and bubbles arises from unique features of the microscale behavior of fluid interfaces. Fluid interfaces confined within microfluidic channels behave quite differently than their counterparts in unbounded flows. Confinement inhibits capillary instabilities so that breakup occurs by largely quasi-static mechanisms. The three-dimensional flow near confined interfaces in rectangular geometries and feedback effects from resistance changes in the entire microfluidic network play important roles in regulating the interfacial deformation. Timescales for transport of surfactants and particles to interfaces compete with flow timescales at the microscale, providing further opportunity for tuning the interfacial coverage and properties of individual droplets and bubbles.},

  year = {2011},
  abstract = {The static shape of droplets under electrowetting actuation is well-understood. The steady-state shape of the droplet is obtained based on the balance of surface tension and electrowetting forces, and the change in apparent contact angle is well-characterized by the Young-Lippmann equation. However, the transient droplet shape behavior when a voltage is suddenly applied across a droplet has received less attention. Additional dynamic frictional forces are at play during this transient process. We present a model to predict this transient behavior of the droplet shape under electrowetting actuation. The droplet shape is modeled using the volume of fluid method. The electrowetting and dynamic frictional forces are included as an effective dynamic contact angle through a force balance at the contact line. The model is used to predict the transient behavior of water droplets on smooth hydrophobic surfaces under electrowetting actuation. The predictions of transient behavior of droplet shape and contact radius are in excellent agreement our experimental measurements. The internal fluid motion is explained and the droplet motion is shown to initiate from the contact line. An approximate mathematical model is also developed to understand the physics of the droplet motion and to describe the overall droplet motion and the contact line velocities.},

  abstract = {Point-of-Care (POC) diagnostics have gained increasing attention in recent years due to its numerous advantages over conventional diagnostic approaches. As proven during the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the rapidity and portability of POC testing improves the efficiency of healthcare services and reduces the burden on healthcare providers. There are hundreds of thousands of different applications for POC diagnostics, however, the ultimate requirement for the test is the same: samplein and result-out. Many technologies have been implemented, such as microfluidics, semiconductors, and nanostructure, to achieve this end. The development of even more powerful POC systems was also enabled by merging multiple technologies into the same system. One successful example is the integration of microfluidics and electronics in POC diagnostics, which has simplified the sample handling process, reduced sample usage, and reduced the cost of the test. This review will analyze the current development of the POC diagnostic systems with the integration of microfluidics and electronics and discuss the future challenges and perspectives that researchers might have.},

  abstract = {Background               Infectious diseases contribute to a high burden of diseases globally. Surveillance using low-cost technology, combined with cutting edge platforms offers a path for understanding the disease ecology of locations of interest in resource-poor countries. Our goal was to pilot a bio surveillance system comprising of rapid lateral flow immunoassays, rapid PCR and a cloud database.                                         Methods                                The study was carried out in Bo, Sierra Leone at the Mercy Hospital. We recruited 1570 subjects over a period of two years. Inclusion criteria for the study were being febrile, being at least five years of age, living within the city of Bo or its neighbouring villages and agreeing to participate in the study. The assays used included a DPP multiplex lateral flow assay for dengue,                 Burkholderia pseudomallei                 ,                 Yersinia pestis                 , malaria Pf/Pan, a Film Array PCR platform with multiplex Biothreat and SASFI panels that together detect over 30 pathogen targets. We used a Deki Reader to upload lateral flow images to the cloud database. The Deki reader quantitates test results, such that scores at {$\geq$}1.75 are considered positive. A special computer program was designed to upload pdf images of PCR results to the cloud database. The cloud database was designed for automated quality assessment and remote monitoring.                                                        Results                                Preliminary results show that out of 1570 samples processed by DPP, 30(1.9\%) were positive for Burkholderia, 41(2.6\%) were positive for Dengue NS1 antigen, 22(1.4\%) were positive for                 Yesinia pestis                 fraction 1 antigen, and 340(21.7\%) were positive for malaria. When a cross-section of results obtained by eye was compared with results automatically detected by the D2C platform, there was 95.2\% concordance between results obtained by eye and those obtained automatically by the Deki reader to the cloud database.                                                        Conclusions               Active disease surveillance and the ability to remotely monitor activities in peripheral health units are critical needs in many poor countries. Our results provide additional perspectives on the twin problem of surveillance and remote quality assessment.},

  abstract = {The electrochemical reduction of nitrate ions at a copper electrode in an unbuffered neutral aqueous solution is studied. Using a two compartment electrochemical cell, three stationary cathodic waves, noted P1, P2 and P3, were evidenced by cyclic voltammetry at -0.9, -1.2 and -1.3 V/SCE, respectively. By comparing the electrochemical response of nitrate and nitrite containing solutions, P1 was attributed to the reduction of nitrate to nitrite. In order to assign P2 and P3 features by determining the number of electrons involved at the corresponding potential, rotating disk electrode experiments at various rotation speeds, combined with linear sweep voltammetry, were performed. Current data analysis at a given potential was carried out using Koutecky--Levich treatment taking into account water reduction. Confident values of the diffusion coefficient D of nitrate ions were assessed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for nitrate concentrations of 10-3, 10-2 and 10-1 M. For a nitrate concentration of 10-2 M, D was found to be 1.31 {\texttimes} 10-5 cm2 s-1 allowing the number of electrons to be determined as 6 for P2 and 8 for P3, in accordance with nitrate reduction into hydroxylamine and ammonia, respectively. The formation of hydroxylamine was confirmed by the observation of its reoxidation at a Pt microelectrode present at the Cu electrode/nitrate solution interface.},

Simultaneous detection of multiple analytes enhances the efficacy of bioassays by providing more data per assay under standardized conditions. Nevertheless, simultaneous handling and assaying of multiple samples, targets, and experimental conditions can be laborious, reagent consuming, and time intensive. Given these demands, microfluidic platforms have emerged over the past two decades as well-suited approaches for multiplexed assays. Microfluidic design supports integration of assay steps and reproducible sample manipulation across large sets of conditions---all relevant to multiplexed assays. Taken together, reduced reagent consumption, faster assay times, and potential for automation stemming from microfluidic assay design are attractive and needed multiplexed assay performance attributes. This review highlights recent advances in multiplexed bioanalyses benefitting from microfluidic integration.},

Ten sampling stations were selected and water samples were collected from each station to assess its chemical properties. The physico-chemical variables including temperature, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, turbidity, ammoniacal-nitrogen (NH3-N), biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total suspended solid (TSS) were measured. The cations (K, Mg, Ca, Na) were analyzed by ICP-MS. Most of the variables were within the drinking water quality standards stipulated by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Ministry of Health (MOH), Malaysia except for turbidity. Sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and salinity hazard were calculated to identify the suitability of the water as irrigation water. The Wilcox diagram classifies that only 10\% of samples are not suitable for the purpose of irrigation. The overall results showed that most of the rivers in Kota Marudu are still in a clean condition and suitable for drinking and irrigation purposes except for Sumbilingan River, which is considered as slightly polluted. The results are supported by the hierarchical cluster analysis as the stations were grouped into two groups; low and high pollution intensities. This preliminary result can update the baseline data of selected water quality parameters in the Kota Marudu and could serve as tool for assisting relevant government bodies in regulating the water resources policies in the future.},

In this paper, a comprehensive overview of microfluidic devices such as micropumps and microneedles has been presented for biomedical applications. The aim of this paper is to present the major features and issues related to micropumps and microneedles, e.g., working principles, actuation methods, fabrication techniques, construction, performance parameters, failure analysis, testing, safety issues, applications, commercialization issues and future prospects. Based on the actuation mechanisms, the micropumps are classified into two main types, i.e., mechanical and non-mechanical micropumps. Microneedles can be categorized according to their structure, fabrication process, material, overall shape, tip shape, size, array density and application. The presented literature review on micropumps and microneedles will provide comprehensive information for researchers working on design and development of microfluidic devices for biomedical applications.},

  abstract = {Inhibition by ammoniacal nitrogen, consisting of free ammonia (NH3) and ammonium ion (NH4{\th}), has been widely investigated for anaerobic digestion. However, despite the large amount of research on the subject, ammoniacal nitrogen inhibition still threatens many anaerobic digesters. This paper presents (i) a method to reliably characterise ammoniacal nitrogen inhibition and (ii) a robust inhibition modelling approach. Results showed that NH3 and NH4{\th} inhibition need to be jointly determined, which can only be done by performing inhibition tests at various total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) concentrations and pH values. These test conditions were reliably achieved using the salts NH4HCO3 and NH4Cl without pH adjustment, rather than by using NH4Cl with pH adjustment. The use of only salts showed a lower pH change during the inhibition test ({\textasciitilde}1.5 days), thereby decreasing the uncertainty in TAN speciation and strengthening the test and model outputs. A threshold inhibition function satisfactorily described (R2 {$>$} 0.99) the joint inhibition of NH3 and NH4{\th} on three distinct inocula, and provided a better description of the inhibition testing results than a non-competitive inhibition function (R2 {\textasciitilde}0.70). The key advantage of the proposed threshold inhibition function is its capacity to identify the inhibition lower limit (concentration where inhibition starts; KImin) and upper limit (concentration where inhibition is complete; KImax). The threshold inhibition function also identifies the 50\% inhibition concentration (KI50) at the midpoint of KImin and KImax. Finally, experimental and model results show that at pH 7.3 e7.7 and TAN concentrations above 2000 mgN\$L 1, both NH3 and NH4{\th} contribute significantly to overall inhibition.},

The main advantage of using the thermocapillary actuation over the traditional electrowetting-on-dielectric actuation in the DMF devices is its ability to work with lower operating DC voltages. The proposed device is fabricated by the low-cost screen printing method using very low-cost materials. In order to overcome the weak controllability of the device over the droplets, a new thermal confinement technique is proposed which simply embedded in the device electrode pattern. A new thermally actuated valve is also designed to work based on thermocapillary actuation for switching on or off the droplets. The fabricated DMF device and the thermal valve are both combined with a microfluidics paper-based analytical device to form a hybrid paper chip in which the droplets are driven by both channelbased and droplet-based devices. The device operation is tested by using a biochemical glucose colorimetric detection assay.},

During this treatment, the beads/cells are retained in a single flow by acoustic radiation force. Eluted peptides are collected from the outlets and subsequently purified by miniaturized solid-phase extraction and analyzed with matrix assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry. Fundamental parameters such as the system fluidics and dispersion are presented.

  abstract = {Biofouling in microfluidic devices limits the type of samples which can be handled and the duration for which samples can be manipulated. Despite the cost of disposing fouled devices, relatively few strategies have been developed to tackle this problem. Here, we have analyzed a series of eight amphiphilic droplet additives, Pluronic coblock polymers of poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), as a solution to biofouling in digital microfluidics using serum-containing cell culture media as a model fluid. Our analysis shows that species with longer PPO chains are superior for enabling droplet motion and reducing biofouling. Two of the tested species, L92 and P105, were found to lengthen device lifetimes by 2 3 times relative to additives used previously when used at optimal concentrations. Pluronics with low PEO content such as L92 were found to be cytotoxic to an immortalized mammalian cell line, and therefore we recommend that Pluronic additives with greater or equal to 50\% PEO composition, such as P105, be used for digital microfluidic applications involving cells. Finally, contact angle measurements were used to probe the interaction between Pluronic-containing droplets and device surfaces. Strong correlations were found between various types of contact angle measurements and the capacity of additives to reduce biofouling, which suggests that contact angle measurements may be useful as a tool for rapidly screening new candidates for the potential to reduce biofouling. We propose that this study will be useful for scientists and engineers who are developing digital microfluidic platforms for a wide range of applications involving protein-containing solutions, and in particular, for applications involving cells.},

  abstract = {Large-scale food-borne outbreaks caused by Salmonella are rarely seen nowadays, thanks to the advanced nature of the medical system. However, small, localised outbreaks in certain regions still exist and could possess a huge threat to the public health if eradication measure is not initiated. This review discusses the progress of Salmonella detection approaches covering their basic principles, characteristics, applications, and performances. Conventional Salmonella detection is usually performed using a culture-based method, which is time-consuming, labour intensive, and unsuitable for on-site testing and high-throughput analysis. To date, there are many detection methods with a unique detection system available for Salmonella detection utilising immunological-based techniques, molecular-based techniques, mass spectrometry, spectroscopy, optical phenotyping, and biosensor methods. The electrochemical biosensor has growing interest in Salmonella detection mainly due to its excellent sensitivity, rapidity, and portability. The use of a highly specific bioreceptor, such as aptamers, and the application of nanomaterials are contributing factors to these excellent characteristics. Furthermore, insight on the types of biorecognition elements, the principles of electrochemical transduction elements, and the miniaturisation potential of electrochemical biosensors are discussed.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidics (DMF) is revolutionizing point-of-care diagnostics by advancing lab-on-a-chip technology. To accelerate translation to real-life applications, it is crucial to devise rapid and low-cost methods for prototyping to test various design ideas. Here, we present one such method using an unmodified desktop inkjet printer and inexpensive materials. Inkjet-printing eliminates the need for costly printed circuit board technology or microfabrication facilities, significantly lowering the barriers to entry for researchers in the field of DMF technology. Here, an inkjet printer is characterized to print conductive tracks of Ag-ink on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and glass slide substrates, delivering a maximum surface conductance of 7.69 {\textohm}-1/cm2. Functional DMF chips are fabricated using tape, parafilm, and SU8 as dielectric and silicone oil as the hydrophobic layers, enabling actuation voltages as low as 144 VDC and 92 VAC@100 kHz for a whole-blood droplet. We detail our actuation and control circuitry, designed entirely with standard electronic modules and components. To showcase our approach, we fabricated a DMF micromixer and assessed its performance using image processing, proving the quality of the mixing. Leveraging affordable inkjet printing, our approach paves the way for highly accessible research and development in DMF-based point-of-care diagnostics.},

  abstract = {The classification of river water quality is a useful way of reporting the water quality status of a river to control water pollution in monitored regions. The main objective of this study is to classify the water quality of the Muda River basin (Malaysia) using nine monitoring stations. This study utilised multivariate analysis of cluster analysis (CA), principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant analysis (DA). CA and PCA identified two different clusters (classes) that reflect the different water quality characteristics of the water systems. DA validated these clusters and produced a discriminant function (DF) that can predict the cluster membership of new samples. The classification generated by the multivariate analysis is consistent with those made by the Department of Environment (DOE). This study demonstrated that multivariate statistical techniques are effective for river water classification.},

These methods are classified into three specific categories, i.e., step emulsification, crossflow, and dispenser nozzle. Previous works on these topics are discussed and related parameters and specifications, including the size, material, production rate, and rotational speed are explicitly mentioned. In addition, the associated theories and important dimensionless numbers are presented. Finally, we discuss the commercialization of these devices and show a comparison to unveil the pros and cons of the different methods so that researchers can select the centrifugal droplet/particle generation method which better suits their needs.},

  abstract = {Rapid and sensitive detection of foodborne pathogens in food industry is of high importance in day-to-day practice to ensure safe food. To address this issue, multiple foodborne pathogens are targeted for rapid identification based in DNA amplification. A 3D PDMS sponge was fabricated using salt crystals as scarifying mold and functionalized with a ligand, apolipoprotein-H (ApoH), to test bacterial capturing for both Gram positive (L. monocytogenes) and negative bacteria (Salmonella spp.), in a microfluidic device. Pure culture of both pathogens in a range of {\textasciitilde}10--105 CFU/mL were tested and the application of the developed automated pre-concentration protocol in real samples was verified using spiked surface samples after swab sampling. Bacterial DNA was extracted directly from the sponge and used for Real Time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) detection. The sponges did not show any significant resistance to sample flow and could easily be incorporated in a microfluidic device. A capture efficiency above 70\% was observed for both targeted (Gram positive and Gram negative) pathogens and a Limit of Detection (LoD) in the range of 103 and 104 CFU/mL was obtained for Salmonella spp. and L. monocytogenes, respectively. Using this approached, we are able to perform multiplexed (Gram positive and Gram negative) capturing and reduce the enrichment time compared to the gold standard plate culture (over 1-day) method. The use of a 3D sponge for direct capturing of multiplexed pathogen on microfluidic device, followed by qPCR detection is an efficient and versatile method to stratify the presence of bacteria. This approach and methodology has potential to be integrated in full automatized device and used as point of need (PoN) system for foodborne pathogen stratification in food packaging/production industries.},

This work describes the sensitive protocols for the simultaneous detection of ammonium and nitrite in water at a new silver-electrodecorated carbon nanotubes-epoxy composite electrode (Ag-CNT) using advanced voltammetric technique. A carbon nanotubes-epoxy composite electrode obtained by two-roll mill procedure was decorated electrochemically with silver nanoparticles. This new electrode displays excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the direct oxidation of ammonium and nitrite at well separated less potential values (+0.15 V/SCE for ammonium and +0.7 V/SCE for nitrite). Very good detection sensitivities (0.613 mA mM-1 for ammonium and 0.980 mA mM-1 for nitrite) and the lowest limits of detection (1 M for ammonium and 0.7 M for nitrite) were achieved by differential-pulsed voltammetry (DPV) under optimum operating conditions of 0.05 V step potential, 0.2 V modulation amplitude and the scan rate of 0.05 V s-1. This detection protocol was successfully applied to the simultaneous determination of ammonium and nitrite in groundwater samples, and the results were found to be consistent with the values obtained by the standardized spectrophotometry methods.},

The scattering matrix method using inductive calculation is used to determine the output signal's intensities in the blood with and without presence of Salmonella. The change in refractive index due to the reaction of Salmonella bacteria with its applied antibody on the flagellin layer loaded on the sensing and detecting microresonator causes the increase in through and dropper port's intensities of the output signal which leads to the detection of SB in blood. A shift in the output signal wavelength is observed with resolution of 0.01 nm. The change in intensity and  shift in wavelength is analyzed with respect to the change in the refractive index which contributes toward achieving an ultra-high sensitivity of 95,500 nm/RIU which is almost two orders higher than that of reported from single ring sensors and the limit of detection is in the order of 1 {\texttimes} 10-8 RIU. In applications, such a system can be employed for a high sensitive and fast detection of bacteria.},

Using photo-resist as a mask instead of some deposition methods makes the procedure more convenient and cost effective compare to other techniques. A smooth channel surface with acceptable sharp wall edges makes this procedure suitable for so many applications that vertical walls are not crucial. The comparison between fabrication of channels using wet etching procedures and molding techniques can help to select the more suitable one for any application which needs specific characteristics.},

  abstract = {This paper presents theoretical and numerical results describing digitized heat transfer (DHT), a newly developing active thermal management technique for high-power density electronics and integrated micro systems. In describing DHT, we numerically investigate the mass, momentum, and energy equations governing the flow within a translating microdroplet. Our analysis shows the existence of a pair of recirculation zones inside the droplet. This internal circulation within discrete fluid slugs results in significantly increased overall heat transfer coefficients when compared to continuous Graetz-type flows. The internal circulation drives the cold fluid in the middle of the droplet to the vicinity of the walls and creates a higher local temperature difference between the wall and the fluid in contact with the wall, resulting in higher heat transfer rates. Nusselt numbers characterizing DHT flow are also shown to exhibit periodic fluctuations with a period equal to the characteristic time scale for droplet circulation. The overall effect of discretizing a flow on heat transfer capability is described and characterized in terms of a nondimensional circulation number defined by the ratio of characteristic thermal diffusion and fluid circulation time scales. DHT coolants, including liquid metals and alloys, are proposed, and their physical properties are shown to enable handling of significantly higher heat transfer rates than classical airor water-cooled methods. The actuation method for DHT coolant transport is also outlined, and shown to provide the capability for active, on-demand suppression of transient hot spots. This overall analysis defines the key parameters for optimization of the DHT method and forms the basis of ongoing experimental work.},

  abstract = {A unified model is presented for the velocity of discrete droplets in microchannels actuated by surface tension modulation. Specific results are derived for the cases of electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD), dielectrophoresis (DEP), continuous electrowetting (CEW), and thermocapillary pumping (TCP). This treatment differs from previously published works by presenting one unified analytic model which is then simply applied to the specific cases of EWOD, CEW, DEP and TCP. In addition, the roles of equiliubrium contact angle and contact angle hysteresis are unambiguously described for each method. The model is shown to agree with experimental and theoretical results presented previously, predicting fluid velocities for a broad range of applications in digitized microfluidics.},

  abstract = {This paper reports measurements that characterize the collection of DNA onto interdigitated microelectrodes by high-frequency dielectrophoresis. Measurements of time-dependent collection of 12 kilobase pair plasmid DNA onto microelectrodes by dielectrophoresis show significant reduction in the response as the frequency increases from 100 kHz to 20 MHz. Collection time profiles are quantitatively measured using fluorescence microscopy over the range 100 kHz to 5 MHz and are represented in terms of two parameters: the initial dielectrophoretic collection rate, and the initial to steady-state collection transition. Measured values for both parameters are consistent with trends in the frequency-dependent real part of the effective polarizability measured for the same plasmid DNA using dielectric spectroscopy. The experimentally measured parameters are qualitatively compared with trends predicted by theory that takes into account dielectrophoretic particle movement and diffusion. The differences between experiment and theory are discussed with suggested improvements to theoretical models, for example, including the effects of electrohydrodynamically driven fluid motion.},

  abstract = {In the past decade, 3D printing technologies have been adopted for the fabrication of microfluidic devices. Extrusionbased approaches including fused filament fabrication (FFF), jetting technologies including inkjet 3D printing, and vat photopolymerization techniques including stereolithography (SLA) and digital light projection (DLP) are the 3D printing methods most frequently adopted by the microfluidic community. Each printing technique has merits toward the fabrication of microfluidic devices. Inkjet printing offers a good selection of materials and multimaterial printing, and the large build space provides manufacturing throughput, while FFF offers a great selection of materials and multimaterial printing but at lower throughput compared to inkjet 3D printing. Technical and material developments adopted from adjacent research fields and developed by the microfluidic community underpin the printing of sub-100 {$\mu$}m enclosed microchannels by DLP, but challenges remain in multimaterial printing throughput. With the feasibility of 3D printed microfluidics established, we look ahead at trends in 3D printing to gain insights toward the future of this technology beyond the sole prism of being an alternative fabrication approach. A shift in emphasis from using 3D printing for prototyping, to mimic conventionally manufactured outputs, toward integrated approaches from a design perspective is critically developed.},

  abstract = {Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) in the past few years has been used to design gas sensors. EIS based gas sensing has been considered as an ultra-sensitive technique to identify and measure different toxic gases. Their sensing performance has been superior when compared to other conventional techniques. Impedance makes it possible to investigate the finer changes occurring on the surface of sensing layers leading to the identification of the target gases such as H               2               S. The measurements are carried out by scanning the electrode surface with a mixture of frequencies from 1 Hz to 10 MHz and recording the response as Nyquist and Bode plots. From these plots, the results can be used to elucidate the electrochemical phenomena. The acquired impedance data can be fitted into equivalent circuits and this is further modeled to obtain information about the interfacial phenomena like grain bulk resistance, grain boundary resistance, interface between electrode and sensing film resistance. These phenomena support the sensing of toxic gases from ppm - ppb level. This article focuses on impedance spectroscopy and its relevance to sensors, challenges in detecting toxic gases on the electrode surfaces prepared using semiconducting metal oxides, doped metal oxides and graphene based composites along with the research gaps, current innovations and future directions. EIS based gas sensors have high selectivity, sensitivity, reproducibility, long term stability and they also assist prediction of the electrochemical mechanisms for the analyte gases.},

  abstract = {This paper reports a droplet-based microfluidic device composed of patterned co-planar electrodes in an all-in-a-single-plate arrangement and coated with dielectric layers for electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) actuation of discrete droplets. The co-planar arrangement is preferred over conventional twoplate electrowetting devices because it provides simpler manufacturing process, reduced viscous drag, and easier liquid-handling procedures. These advantages lead to more versatile and efficient microfluidic devices capable of generating higher droplet speed and can incorporate various other droplet manipulation functions into the system for biological, sensing, and other microfluidic applications. We have designed, fabricated, and tested the devices using an insulating layer with materials having relatively high dielectric constant (SiO2) and compared the results with polymer coatings (Cytop) with low dielectric constant. Results show that the device with high dielectric layer generates more reproducible droplet transfer over a longer distance with a 25\% reduction in the actuation voltage with respect to the polymer coatings, leading to more energy efficient microfluidic applications. We can generate droplet speeds as high as 26 cm/s using materials with high dielectric constant such as SiO2.},

Digital microfluidics is gaining popularity in biological and biomedical applications due to its ability to manipulate discrete droplet volumes (nL--pL), which significantly reduces the need for a costly and precious biological and physiological sample volume and, thus, diagnostic time. Despite the importance of discrete droplet volume handling, the ability of continuous microfluidics to process larger sample volumes at a higher throughput cannot be easily reproduced by merely using droplets. To bridge this gap, in this work, parallel channels are formed and programmed to split into multiple droplets, while droplets are programmed to be split from one channel, transferred and merged into another channel. This programmable handling of channels and droplets combines the continuous and digital paradigms of microfluidics, showing the potential for a wider range of microfluidic functions to enable applications ranging from clinical diagnostics in resource-limited environments, to rapid system prototyping, to high throughput pharmaceutical applications.},

  abstract = {A variety of modern applications including soft robotics, prosthetics, and health monitoring devices that cover electronic skins (e-skins), wearables as well as implants have been developed within the last two decades to bridge the gap between artificial and biological systems. During this development, high-density integration of various sensing modalities into flexible electronic devices becomes vitally important to improve the perception and interaction of the human bodies and robotic appliances with external environment. As a key component in flexible electronics, the flexible thin-film transistors (TFTs) have seen significant advances, allowing for building flexible active matrices. The flexible active matrices have been integrated with distributed arrays of sensing elements, enabling the detection of signals over a large area. The integration of sensors within pixels of flexible active matrices has brought the application scenarios to a higher level of sophistication with many advanced functionalities. Herein, recent progress in the active matrix flexible sensory systems is reviewed. The materials used to construct the semiconductor channels, the dielectric layers, and the flexible substrates for the active matrices are summarized. The pixel designs and fabrication strategies for the active matrix flexible sensory systems are briefly discussed. The applications of the flexible sensory systems are exemplified by reviewing pressure sensors, temperature sensors, photodetectors, magnetic sensors, and biosignal sensors. At the end, the recent development is summarized and the vision on the further advances of flexible active matrix sensory systems is provided.},

Glucose, lproline and glycine solutions with different concentrations are loaded into the sensor and consequently impact the frequency of the minimum reflection coefficient. The proposed sensor achieves a linear correlation between its minimum reflection coefficient frequency and permittivity of the loaded solutions. Mixtures between fetal bovine serum (FBS) and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) having FBS volume fractions of 0\%, 20 \%, 40 \%, 60 \%, 80 \% and 100 \% are also loaded into the proposed sensor. A linear relationship between the volume fractions of the loaded mixtures and the minimum reflection coefficient frequency point of the proposed sensor is as well achieved. Measurement results demonstrate the potential of the proposed miniaturized sensor, coupled with the dislocated-of-the-chip and space-consuming supporting microwave circuitry, for applications such as sample preparation at the microfluidic scale.},

In order to integrate the IDC sensor on a labon-chip, it is often required to minimize and optimize the sensor for sensitive and efficient performance. However, the conventional numerical simulation approach is quite time-consuming. Therefore, an efficient analytical method is proposed herein, leading to accurate capacitance and conductance expressions of an arbitrary multilayer-structured IDC. The model is validated with practical measurements of a series of coplanar waveguide (CPW) structure-based IDCs. In addition, an accurate characterization function, which relates the IDC capacitance and conductance to the complex permittivity of a material loaded on the top of the IDC sensing area, is obtained. The characterization function shows good agreement with the finite-element method (FEM) simulation results, which demonstrates the capability of the IDC sensor in dielectric spectroscopy measurements of {\textmu}L and even nL liquids.},

Two sensors are used in the paper to characterize saline solutions by measuring the broadband complex permittivity. The two sensors are based on transmission line and interdigital electrodes designed for low- and high- frequency measurements, respectively, on the basis of the coplanar waveguide structure due to its convenience of fabrication and integration with microfluidic structures for liquid measurements. Different from traditional work where the finite element simulation method is used, the characterization theories of the two sensors are built based on a numerical modeling procedure, which can dramatically increase the device design efficiency, taking just a few seconds. Differently from the finite element method, the proposed numerical analysis utilizes a conformal mapping technique for both sensors. The characterization theories of the two sensors are validated by measuring de-ionized water. The platform is finally used to measure 0.1 and 0.5 mol/L saline solutions within a broadband frequency range going from 10 up to 50 GHz, with the repeatability error within 5\%.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Acoustophoretic microfluidic devices have been developed for accurate, label-free, contactless, and non-invasive manipulation of bioparticles in different biofluids. However, their widespread application is limited due to the need for the use of high quality microchannels made of materials with high specific acoustic impedances relative to the fluid (e.g., silicon or glass with small damping coefficient), manufactured by complex and expensive microfabrication processes. Soft polymers with a lower fabrication cost have been introduced to address the challenges of silicon- or glass-based acoustophoretic microfluidic systems. However, due to their small acoustic impedance, their efficacy for particle manipulation is shown to be limited. Here, we developed a new acoustophoretic microfluid system fabricated by a hybrid sound-hard (aluminum) and sound-soft (polydimethylsiloxane polymer) material. The performance of this hybrid device for manipulation of bead particles and cells was compared to the acoustophoretic devices made of acoustically hard materials. The results show that particles and cells in the hybrid material microchannel travel to a nodal plane with a much smaller energy density than conventional acoustic-hard devices but greater than polymeric microfluidic chips. Against conventional acoustic-hard chips, the nodal line in the hybrid microchannel could be easily tuned to be placed in an off-center position by changing the frequency, effective for particle separation from a host fluid in parallel flow stream models. It is also shown that the hybrid acoustophoretic device deals with smaller temperature rise which is safer for the actuation of bioparticles. This new device eliminates the limitations of each sound-soft and sound-hard materials in terms of cost, adjusting the position of nodal plane, temperature rise, fragility, production cost and disposability, making it desirable for developing the next generation of economically viable acoustophoretic products for ultrasound particle manipulation in bioengineering applications.},

The catalytic activity of the materials were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed Pt peaks attributed to the face-centered cubic (FCC) structure as well SnO2 cassiterite. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images shows cubic Pt nanoparticles (PtNPs) as well SnO2 highly dispersed onto carbon support and surrounding the PtNPs. CV experiments show that the peak current density for AmER on Pt/C (100) is 2.83 times higher than on Pt/C. The presence of tin onto the catalysts (PtSnO2/C and PtSnO2/C (100)) promoted a decrease of about 70 mV on the onset potential for AmER. The current density at 60 min of CA measurements on PtSnO2/C (100) was 1.51 times higher than on Pt/C (100), and on PtSnO2/C was 1.76 times of Pt/C. The EIS experiments show that the charge transfer resistance decreases as the catalytic activity of the materials for AmER increases. The high catalytic activity of the materials with platinum (100) preferentially orientation might be due to the higher tolerance for the Nads poisoning intermediates. The presence of SnO2 might prevent platinum surface from deactivation caused by intermediates formed during the AmER process.},

The microfluidic system consists of four filling chambers and the fluid transport channels required for flushing and filling. At the bottom section of each chamber there is a gold-deposited electrode that allows electrical interaction with the sample. The chamber's geometry, transport channels, and the electrodes were designed using an optimization process through multiphysics simulations. Then, different manufacturing processes were developed experimentally for SU8 and PDMS which allowed to carry out the implementation of the microfluidic system. An electrical communication interface was designed for the interconnection of the microfluidic system with the vector network analyzer (VNA). Then, the measurements required to obtain the behavior of each sensor were developed.},

Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) technology, due to its outstanding flexibility and integrability, has emerged as a promising candidate for such lab-on-chip applications. Triggered by an electrical stimulus, EWOD devices allow precise manipulation of single droplets along the designed electrode arrays without employing external pumps and valves, thereby enhancing the miniaturization and portability of the system towards transcending important laboratory assays in resource-limited settings. In recent years, the simple fabrication process and reprogrammable architecture of EWOD chips have led to their widespread applications in food safety analysis. Various EWOD devices have been developed for the quantitative monitoring of analytes such as food-borne pathogens, heavy metal ions, vitamins, and antioxidants, which are significant in food samples. In this paper, we reviewed the advances and developments in the design of EWOD systems for performing versatile functions starting from sample preparation to sample detection, enabling rapid and high-throughput food analysis.},

  abstract = {Electric field-based smart wetting manipulation is one of the extensively used techniques in modern surface science and engineering, especially in microfluidics and optofluidics applications. Liquid dielectrophoresis (LDEP) is a technique involving the manipulation of dielectric liquid motion via the polarization effect using a non-homogeneous electric field. The LDEP technique was mainly dedicated to the actuation of dielectric and aqueous liquids in microfluidics systems. Recently, a new concept called dielectrowetting was demonstrated by which the wettability of a dielectric liquid droplet can be reversibly manipulated via a highly localized LDEP force at the three-phase contact line of the droplet. Although dielectrowetting is principally very different from electrowetting on dielectrics (EWOD), it has the capability to spread a dielectric droplet into a thin liquid film with the application of sufficiently high voltage, overcoming the contact-angle saturation encountered in EWOD. The strength of dielectrowetting depends on the ratio of the penetration depth of the electric field inside the dielectric liquid and the difference between the dielectric constants of the liquid and its ambient medium. Since the introduction of the dielectrowetting technique, significant progress in the field encompassing various real-life applications was demonstrated in recent decades. In this paper, we review and discuss the governing forces and basic principles of LDEP, the mechanism of interface localization of LDEP for dielectrowetting, related phenomenon, and their recent applications, with an outlook on the future research.},

Modern synthetic biology has been reinvented as an engineering discipline to design new organisms as well as to better understand fundamental biological mechanisms. However, success is still largely limited to the laboratory and transformative applications of synthetic biology are still in their infancy. Here, we review six principles of living systems and how they compare and contrast with engineered systems. We cite specific examples from the synthetic biology literature that illustrate these principles and speculate on their implications for further study. To fully realize the promise of synthetic biology, we must be aware of life's unique properties.},

Point-of-care pathogen diagnosis can be a tremendous help in managing disease outbreaks as well as in routine healthcare settings. Infectious pathogens can be identified with high specificity using molecular methods. A plethora of microfluidic innovations in recent years have now made it increasingly feasible to develop portable, robust, accurate, and sensitive genomic diagnostic devices for deployment at the point of care. However, improving processing time, multiplexed detection, sensitivity and limit of detection, specificity, and ease of deployment in resource-limited settings are ongoing challenges.

Herein, we report that the electrical properties relevant to electrowetting for a widely used dielectric, PDMS, can be substantially enhanced upon the incorporation of graphene oxide (GO) fillers into the PDMS polymer matrix. The GO-PDMS composite is characterized by higher values of the dielectric constant, higher breakdown electric field, and lower actuation voltages due to enhanced interfacial polarization. The improvement of these properties with the increase in concentration of GO, is explored till the `percolation threshold'. This newly developed composite as the dielectric, droplet actuation and electric field-induced droplet transportation over a fabricated triangular electrode system are performed. The results are compared with the literature data on PDMS and other dielectrics to establish the superior qualities of the dielectric for rapid transportation of droplets at significantly lower voltages with potential for new applications.},

However, long term stability of enhancement mode devices decreases with the deep channel implant dose. A similar behavior is observed for depletion mode devices. Significant improvement in device stability can be realized using buried channel conduction. However, short channel effects attain untolerable magnitudes in devices with deep buried channels. It is concluded in this paper, that the conventional approaches used for optimization of long term stability and d.c. characteristics of small size MOSFBTs are technologically incompatible.

While many of these effects are understood for specific, approximate models of the particles' interactions, there are a number of proposed force laws in the literature, especially for viscous interactions. We numerically measure the complex shear modulus               G               * of jammed packings for various viscous force laws that damp relative velocities between pairs of contacting particles or between a particle and the continuous fluid phase.

Firstly, side-view observations using stroboscopic recording techniques were used to measure and analyse droplet deformations as well as the front and rear apparent contact angles during motion. Secondly, the influence of viscosity on the droplet velocity as a function of the applied voltage was studied. This has revealed that low Reynolds number droplet motion can be described by the simple laminar viscous model of Brochard. Finally, the influence of the dielectric thickness on the droplet dynamics was studied. It is shown that droplet velocity is limited by a saturation effect of the driving electrostatic force and that this phenomenon is very similar to that occurring in static experiments.},

  abstract = {Salmonella is a diverse genus of Gram-negative bacilli and a major foodborne pathogen responsible for more than a million illnesses annually in the United States alone. Rapid, reliable detection and identification of this pathogen in food and environmental sources is key to safeguarding the food supply. Traditional microbiological culture techniques have been the `gold standard' for State and Federal regulators. Unfortunately, the time to result is too long to effectively monitor foodstuffs, especially those with very short shelf lives. Advances in traditional microbiology and molecular biology over the past 25 years have greatly improved the speed at which this pathogen is detected. Nonetheless, food and environmental samples possess a distinctive set of challenges for these newer, more rapid methodologies. Furthermore, more detailed identification and subtyping strategies still rely heavily on the availability of a pure isolate. However, major shifts in DNA sequencing technologies are meeting this challenge by advancing the detection, identification and subtyping of Salmonella towards a culture-independent diagnostic framework. This review will focus on current approaches and state-of-the-art next-generation advances in the detection, identification and subtyping of Salmonella from food and environmental sources.},

  abstract = {The monitoring of pesticide residues in water sources is essential because of their increased worldwide demand in agriculture and their subsequent detection in waters. Pesticide residues in water matrices are traditionally determined by multiresidue methodologies based on chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. However, for quaternary ammonium pesticide residues, as highly polar compounds, the chromatographic approach frequently fails, requiring modifications in the separation method, or even an alternative technique for analyte quantification. Therefore, to solve this analytical limitation for these residues, several authors proposed unusual methodologies, such as those based on spectroscopic or electroanalytical approaches. This review intends to offer an overview of the analysis of quaternary ammonium pesticide residues in different water sources, focusing on advances in sample preparation before chromatographic separations and alternative analytical techniques, such as spectroscopy and electroanalytical methods.},

  abstract = {Digital (droplet) microfluidics (D{\textmu}F) is a powerful platform for automated lab-on-a-chip procedures, ranging from quantitative bioassays such as RT-qPCR to complete mammalian cell culturing. The simple MEMS processing protocols typically employed to fabricate D{\textmu}F devices limit their functionality to two dimensions, and hence constrain the applications for which these devices can be used. This paper describes the integration of vertical functionality into a D{\textmu}F platform by stacking two planar digital microfluidic devices, altering the electrode fabrication process, and incorporating channels for reversibly translating droplets between layers. Vertical droplet movement was modeled to advance the device design, and three applications that were previously unachievable using a conventional format are demonstrated: (1) solutions of calcium dichloride and sodium alginate were vertically mixed to produce a hydrogel with a radially symmetric gradient in crosslink density; (2) a calcium alginate hydrogel was formed within the through-well to create a particle sieve for filtering suspensions passed from one layer to the next; and (3) a cell spheroid formed using an on-chip hanging-drop was retrieved for use in downstream processing. The general capability of vertically delivering droplets between multiple stacked levels represents a processing innovation that increases D{\textmu}F functionality and has many potential applications.},

  abstract = {Increased use of digital microfluidic (DMF) biochips has fueled the replacement of expensive healthcare and biochemical laboratory procedures with low-cost, fully-automated, miniaturized integrated systems. Dilution and mixing of fluid samples in a certain ratio are two fundamental primitives needed in sample preparation, which is an essential component of almost all protocols. Most of the existing dilution algorithms used in droplet-based microfluidic systems deploy a sequence of (1 : 1) mix-split steps, where two unit volume droplets of different concentrations are mixed, followed by a balanced split operation to obtain two equal-sized droplets. In this work, we introduce a simulation-guided optimization procedure (SIMOP) for achieving the target concentrations while optimizing multiple factors according to user-specified priority levels. The SIMOP algorithm produces a given concentration while optimizing each criterion as desired. Experimental results favorably demonstrate the performance of the proposed procedure compared to many previous algorithms used for single-target dilution. We also study the impact of errors caused by unbalanced droplet splitting on the accuracy of target concentration obtained by SIMOP sequences. Experimental study reveals that SIMOP outperforms previous algorithms from the perspective of volumetric error management that may occur in reaction paths. The proposed technique may find many potential applications to robust sample preparation needed in diverse areas of biomedical engineering and healthcare domains.},

The presented measurements indicate that the electrowetting equation is valid down to a 6 nm thick aFP film on a 11 nm thick SiO2. At this dielectric thickness, a remarkable contact angle change of over 100{\textopenbullet} can be achieved with an applied voltage less than 3 V across the system. The data also shows that for this water/surfactant/oil system, contact angle saturation is independent of the electric field, and is reached when the surface energy of the solid--water interface approaches zero.},

The electrode materials were characterized for the physical properties by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis.

  abstract = {Significance             Microfluidic systems promise to improve the analysis and synthesis of materials, biological or otherwise, by lowering the required volume of fluid samples, offering a tightly controlled fluid-handling environment, and simultaneously integrating various chemical processes. To build these systems, designers depend on microfabrication techniques that restrict them to arranging their designs in two dimensions and completely fabricating their design in a single step. This study introduces modular, reconfigurable components containing fluidic and sensor elements adaptable to many different microfluidic circuits. These elements can be assembled to allow for 3D routing of channels. This assembly approach allows for the application of network analysis techniques like those used in classical electronic circuit design, facilitating the straightforward design of predictable flow systems.           ,              Microfluidic systems are rapidly becoming commonplace tools for high-precision materials synthesis, biochemical sample preparation, and biophysical analysis. Typically, microfluidic systems are constructed in monolithic form by means of microfabrication and, increasingly, by additive techniques. These methods restrict the design and assembly of truly complex systems by placing unnecessary emphasis on complete functional integration of operational elements in a planar environment. Here, we present a solution based on discrete elements that liberates designers to build large-scale microfluidic systems in three dimensions that are modular, diverse, and predictable by simple network analysis techniques. We develop a sample library of standardized components and connectors manufactured using stereolithography. We predict and validate the flow characteristics of these individual components to design and construct a tunable concentration gradient generator with a scalable number of parallel outputs. We show that these systems are rapidly reconfigurable by constructing three variations of a device for generating monodisperse microdroplets in two distinct size regimes and in a high-throughput mode by simple replacement of emulsifier subcircuits. Finally, we demonstrate the capability for active process monitoring by constructing an optical sensing element for detecting water droplets in a fluorocarbon stream and quantifying their size and frequency. By moving away from large-scale integration toward standardized discrete elements, we demonstrate the potential to reduce the practice of designing and assembling complex 3D microfluidic circuits to a methodology comparable to that found in the electronics industry.},

  abstract = {Advances in digital microfluidic (DMF) technologies offer a promising platform for a variety of biochemical applications, ranging from massively parallel DNA analysis and computational drug discovery to toxicity monitoring and medical diagnosis. In this paper, we address the migration problem that arises when the technology undergoes a change in the context of digital microfluidics. Given a bio-chemical reaction synthesized for actuation on a given DMF architecture, we discuss how the same bio-chemical reaction can be ported seamlessly to an enhanced architecture, with possible modifications to the architectural parameters (e.g., clock frequency, mixer size, and mixing time) or geometric changes (e.g., change in reservoir locations or mixer positions, inclusion of new sensors or other physical resources). Complete resynthesis of the protocol for the new architecture may often become either inefficient or even infeasible due to scalability, proprietary, security, or cost issues. We propose an adaptation method for handling such technologychanges by modifying the existing actuation sequence through an incremental procedure. The foundation of our method lies in symbolic encoding and satisfiability (SAT)-solvers, enriched with pertinent graph-theoretic and geometric techniques. This enables us to generate functionally correct solutions for the new target architecture without necessitating a complete resynthesis step, thereby enabling the utilization of these chips by users in biology who are not familiar with the on-chip synthesis toolflow. We highlight the benefits of the proposed approach through extensive simulations on assay benchmarks.},

  abstract = {Research on so called digital microfluidic systems (DMS) capable of manipulating individual microdroplets on a cell-based structure has enormously increased in the past few years, mainly due to the demand of the technology-dependent biomedical applications. Significant research in this area has been related to the simulation and modeling of droplet motion, demonstration of different drop actuation techniques on laboratory-scale prototypes, and droplet routing and scheduling for more efficient assay procedures. This paper introduces the basics of the control analysis and design of a DMS, which is a relatively unexplored area in digital microfluidics. This paper starts with a discussion on a simplified dynamic model of droplet motion in a planar array of cells, and continues with more complicated dynamic models that are necessary to realize the structure of an appropriate closed-loop control system for the DMS. The control analysis and design includes both the transient and steady-state responses of the DMS under external driving forces. The proposed control analysis and design approach is implemented into SIMULINK{\textregistered} models to demonstrate the performance of the DMS through simulation using the system parameters previously reported in the literature.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic systems (DMS), where liquid droplets are manipulated on a planar surface, are the recent generation of microfluidic systems. Specifically, the systems where electrowetting force is employed for the actuation of droplets on a 2-D array of electrodes are capable of performing many of the basic fluidic operations. In these systems, the actuation force on the liquid droplet is a function of the applied voltage and its frequency, dielectric properties of the liquid and the insulating material, and finally the instantaneous position of the droplet between two adjacent electrodes. At lower frequencies the applied voltage is dropped almost entirely in the insulating layer for droplets of aqueous liquids. The unit area capacitance of the insulating layer depends linearly on the dielectric constant and inversely on the thickness. Therefore, for a given voltage and frequency, stronger actuation force can be generated if a thinner layer of material with high dielectric strength is used. However, the electric-field strength of the material poses the limitation on reducing the thickness of insulating layer. Typical insulators, with high electric field strength, used in microelectromechanical systems require quite sophisticated equipment for their deposition on the substrates. On the other hand, spin-coating of polymer insulators have been adopted as an economic and faster alternative technique for the fabrication of DMS. Polymer insulators possess reasonable dielectric strength and lower thickness can be achieved from higher spin speeds. However, low electric-field strengths of these materials prohibit working with thinner layers. As a result, actuation of droplets in DMS, fabricated using these materials as insulators, requires higher voltages. Higher applied voltages are not desirable for portable systems dealing with sensitive liquid samples. This paper presents an investigation on different insulating materials in terms of the ease of fabrication and the minimum voltage requirements for operation. The results can be useful in choosing the insulating material that will result in the expected level of performance while meeting the resource constraints. As a result, this paper specifies the material, based on the comparative study, that can be used to avoid the need for a sophisticated deposition system and the fabricated DMS can be operated with much lower voltages.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) are now being extensively used to automate several biochemical laboratory protocols such as clinical analysis, point-of-care diagnostics, or DNA sequencing. In many biological assays, e.g., bacterial susceptibility tests and cellular response analysis, samples or reagents are required in multiple concentration (or dilution) factors, satisfying certain gradient patterns such as linear, exponential, or parabolic. Dilution gradients are traditionally prepared using continuous-flow microfluidic devices. Unfortunately, most of them suffer from inflexibility and non-programmability, and they require large volumes of costly stock-solutions. DMFBs, on the other hand, are shown to produce, more efficiently, samples with multiple dilution factors. However, none of the existing DMFBbased algorithms utilize the properties of the gradient-profile while optimizing reactant-cost and sample-preparation time. In this work, we explore the underlying combinatorial attributes of different gradients and harnessed them for efficient production of the desired concentration profile. For linear gradients, we present theoretical results concerning the number of mix-split operations and waste production, and prove an upper bound on on-chip storage requirement. A cost-effective method for generating a wide class of exponential gradients is also proposed. Finally, in order to handle a complex-shaped gradient, we posit a digitalgeometric technique to approximate it with a sequence of linear gradients. Experimental results on various gradient-profiles are presented in support of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) is a highly efficient technology to perform biological and medical analyses through the manipulation of pico- to nano-liter droplets on digital microfluidic systems (DMS). Droplet splitting is one of the basic fluidic operations that play a vital role in microscale mixing and concentration control. This paper presents the results of numerical investigation of unequal droplet splitting. In order to gain insight into the mechanism of droplet splitting, a three-electrode splitting system is simulated in FLOW3D{\textregistered} for given geometry and material properties. When unequal voltages are applied to the adjacent electrodes on both sides of a droplet the distribution of electric field exerts spatially varying stress causing the deformation of the interface. The resulting unequal fluid flow rates towards the activated electrodes are determined by the coupled electro-hydrodynamics. The results of multiple simulation runs in terms of liquid flow rates with different ratios of the applied voltage will be very useful in developing the open-loop model of droplet splitting that can be later adopted to design a controller for unequal splitting in DMS.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic (DMF) biochips offer a versatile platform for implementing several laboratory based biochemical protocols. These tiny chips can electrically control the dynamics of nanoliter volume of discrete fluid droplets on an electrode array with desired actuation patterns. One important step in biochemical sample preparation is dilution, where the objective is to prepare a fluid with a desired concentration factor. Bioassays implemented on DMF biochips may require several different concentration values of the same sample. In this paper, we propose a scheme in which a set of different target droplets (target concentration values ranged between 0\% and 100\%) can be produced using 0\% concentration (buffer solution) and 100\% concentration (sample/reagent), with an error bounded above by 1 2n+1 , where concentration values are rounded-off by an n-bit binary fraction. Simulation results show that significant amount of savings in the number of mix-split steps and waste droplets can be achieved in comparison with the repeated use of existing single target based methods for generating multiple concentration factors.},

For a major class of DMFBs droplet actuation is depend on the rule of electrowetting-on-dielectric, where separate droplets of nano liter volume can be manipulated using 2D array of electrodes. Most important design automation issues in DMFBs is the concurrent routing of droplets inside a 2D array. The reason of droplet steering is needed to plan the movement of a number of droplets in a time synchronized mode within a 2D array while minimizing resource consumption and within optimum latest arrival time. The droplets may be classified as homogeneous or heterogeneous. In case of heterogeneous droplet routing, major issue is the avoidance of cross contamination where as for homogeneous droplet routing sharing of electrodes among different route paths for minimum resource utilization remains the main focus. In our paper, we put forward an algorithm for routing of heterogeneous droplet inDMFBs. We further developed a routing simulator that graphically displays detailed route performance for heterogeneous droplets within a predefined DMFB layout. We have used benchmark suite I and III to analysis our algorithm.},

In this paper, an innovative portable device for both quantitative and semiquantitative electrochemical analysis is presented. This device can operate autonomously without the need of relying on other devices (e.g., PC, tablets, or smartphones) thanks to built-in Wi-Fi connectivity. The developed hardware is integrated into a cloud-based platform, exploiting the cloud computational power to perform innovative algorithms for calibration (e.g., Machine Learning tools). Results and configurations can be accessed through a web page without the installation of dedicated APPs or software. The electrical input/output characteristic was measured with a dummy cell as a load, achieving excellent linearity. Furthermore, the device response to five different concentrations of potassium ferri/ferrocyanide redox probe was compared with a bench-top laboratory instrument. No difference in analytical sensitivity was found. Also, some examples of application-specific tests were set up to demonstrate the use in real-case scenarios. In addition, Support Vector Machine algorithm was applied to semi-quantitative analyses to classify the input samples into four classes, achieving an average accuracy of 98.23\%.

The ddPCR platform, which uses a mineral oil-saturated polydimethylsiloxane (OSP) chip to overcome the problem of droplet evaporation, integrates the functions of droplet generation, onchip amplification and end-point fluorescence readout. Simultaneous detection of two kinds of bacterial is achieved by the design of differentially labeled TaqMan-MGB fluorescent probes. Compared with a quantitative real-time PCR approach, the OSP chip-based duplex ddPCR platform exhibits high sensitivity, which is at the level of single molecule resolution without significant cross-assay interference. Moreover, the applicability of the proposed method is also evaluated in artificially contaminated drinking water sample, which displays a low detection limit down to 10 CFU/mL for both pathogenic bacterial within 2 h.},

  abstract = {Chemical-reaction-based microfluidic circuits are expected to provide new opportunities to perform signal processing functions over the molecular domain. To realize this vision, in this article, we exploit and present the digital signal processing capabilities of chemical-reaction-based microfluidic circuits. To facilitate microfluidic circuit design, we describe a microfluidic circuit using a five-level architecture: molecular propagation, chemical transformation, microfluidic modules, microfluidic logic gates, and microfluidic circuits. We first identify the components at Levels 1 and 2, and present how their combinations can build the basic modules for Level 3. We then assemble basic modules to construct five types of logic gates for Level 4, including AND, NAND, OR, NOR, and XOR gates, which show advantages of microfluidic circuits in versatility and modularity. Finally, we discuss challenges and potential solutions for designing, building, and testing microfluidic circuits with complex signal processing functions in Level 5 based on the digital logic gates at Level 4.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Porous gas-diffusion electrodes (GDEs) are widely used in electrochemical applications where a gaseous reactant is converted to a target product. Important applications for silver-based GDEs are the chlor-alkali and the CO               2               electrolysis processes in which silver catalyzes the oxygen- or carbon dioxide reduction reaction. The wetting of the porous GDEs is of utmost importance for the achieved performance of the electrode: a completely dry electrode will result in low current densities due to the reduced active surface area while on the other hand, a completely flooded electrode will deteriorate the access of the gaseous reactant. Therefore, we investigated silver-based GDEs for the oxygen reduction reaction with different amounts of the hydrophobic agent polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and analyzed the potential-induced wetting behavior (electrowetting). The electrolyte breakthrough was recorded by a digital microscope and subsequently evaluated via imaging analysis of the observed breached electrolyte droplets. In order to characterize the wetting state during transition to the steady-state, we applied electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements and retrieved the double-layer capacitance. Our results indicate that a higher overvoltage facilitates the breakthrough of electrolytes through the gas-diffusion electrode. Surprisingly, a faster breakthrough of electrolyte was observed for electrodes with higher PTFE content. Porometry measurements revealed that the GDE with low PTFE content has a monomodal pore size distribution, whereas electrodes with higher PTFE amount exhibit a bimodal pore size distribution. In GDEs with monomodal pore size distribution the time in which the double layer capacitance is leveling off correlates with the breakthrough time of the electrolyte. In summary, we emphasize that the wetting of GDEs is a complex interplay of the applied potential, electrode composition, and resulting porous structure which requires further advanced measurements and analysis considering the parameters affecting the wetting behavior as a whole.},

While recent work has demonstrated feasibility mainly with single droplets on small arrays, these systems hold promise for commercial-scale applications by simultaneously moving many droplets on large arrays. This paper introduces a broadly applicable approach to optimally control digital microfluidic systems, i.e., software algorithms that generate a sequence of control signals for moving one or many droplets from start to goal positions in the shortest number of steps, subject to constraints such as minimum required separation between droplets, obstacles on the array surface, and limitations in the control circuitry.},

  abstract = {Magnetically actuated droplet manipulation offers a promising tool for biomedical and engineering applications, such as drug delivery, biochemistry, sample handling in lab-on-chip devices and tissue engineering. In this study, characteristics of an adjustable alternating magnetic field generated by a magnetic coil for droplet manipulation was investigated which enables more control on droplet transport, and it can be considered as a suitable alternative for moving magnets or an array of micro-coils. By adjusting the magnetic flux density, the duty cycle and applied magnetic frequency, the manipulation of waterbased ferrofluid droplets with a bio-compatible surfactant for different volumes was comprehensively examined. Also, the platform was able to manipulate the ferrofluid droplets completely immersed in oil. This solves the problem with droplet evaporation which has previously been reported for droplet manipulation on the surface. Furthermore, an analytical model is proposed for the movement of the ferrofluid droplet on the hydrophobic surface. The model predictions are in good agreement with experimental results. Also, the effects of magnetic flux density, duty cycle, frequency and the distance between the coils on the mixing process were studied. Results showed that the droplet movement on the hydrophobic surface was fully synchronized with the generated signal while the droplet moved backward in the oil after the magnetic field was turned off. By decreasing magnetic flux density, droplet volume, duty cycle, as well as increasing applied magnetic frequency, the step lengths become more uniform, the resolution of droplet displacement increases, but the average-velocity decreases.},

An electrowettingon-dielectric (EWOD) digital microfluidic device with parallel plates configuration was used to control coolant droplet motion. Periodic rise and falls in hotspot temperature were measured when multiple water droplets moved over the hotspot surface while a constant heat flux was applied at the hotspot. Synchronized high-speed video data of droplet motion shows that phase-change heat transfer (i.e. evaporation) at the water droplet meniscus coincided with additional temperature drop at the hotspot. Furthermore, the heat transfer coefficient of water droplet evaporation was measured on a hydrophilic hotspot surface. The hydrophilic surface regulated the hotspot temperature within a lower envelope for a longer time.},

Based on such principles, we derive mathematical models of the fundamental components of a microfluidic network and, then, we identify the set of variables that capture the dynamic state of the system. This allows us to define a simple way to simulate the ``macroscopic'' evolution of the microfluidic network, predicting the path followed by the droplets in the circuits. To validate the model, we compare the simulation results with the experimental outcomes we obtained from a simple but representative microfluidic circuit, which has been realized in our laboratory, and with other circuits tested in previous works. Finally, we apply our theoretical model to a more complex usecase, consisting in a microfluidic network with bus topology, and we draw some final considerations about the performance of such a network.},

  abstract = {Fast and accurate point-of-care testing (POCT) of infectious diseases is crucial for diminishing the pandemic miseries. To fight the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), numerous interesting electrochemical point-of-care (POC) tests have been evolved to rapidly identify the causal organism SARS-CoV-2 virus, its nucleic acid and antigens, and antibodies of the patients. Many of those electrochemical biosensors are impressive in terms of miniaturization, mass production, ease of use, and speed of test, and they could be recommended for future applications in pandemic-like circumstances. On the other hand, self-diagnosis, sensitivity, specificity, surface chemistry, electrochemical components, device configuration, portability, small analyzers, and other features of the tests can yet be improved. Therefore, this report reviews the developmental trend of electrochemical POC tests (i.e., test platforms and features) reported for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 and correlates any significant advancements with relevant references. POCTs incorporating microfluidic/plastic chips, paper devices, nanomaterial-aided platforms, smartphone integration, self-diagnosis, and epidemiological reporting attributes are also surfed to help with future pandemic preparedness. This review especially screens the low-cost and easily affordable setups so that management of pandemic disease becomes faster and easier. Overall, the review is a wide-ranging package for finding appropriate strategies of electrochemical POCT targeting pandemic infectious disease detection.},

Applications included the monitoring of protein films on contact-less interdigitated electrode structures and conductivity detection of droplets on insulated two-electrode structures. The use of electrode passivation eliminated electrode degradation. Experimental results were compared to theoretical analytical models, and were found to closely correlate with one another. The analytical models were used to design the transducer for optimal conductivity detection. The results inform the current research efforts for the development of in-line impedance spectroscopy in digital microfluidics and confirm the use of simple analytical models for the first-order estimation of the frequency response of interdigitated electrode structures.},

First, using polymeric spheres of different sizes and materials, we verify that our assay data follow the standard acoustic theory with great accuracy. We furthermore verify that our technique not only is able to measure compressibilities of living cells but can also sense an artificial cytoskeleton inside a biomimetic vesicle. We finally provide a thorough discussion about the expected accuracy our approach provides. To conclude, we show that compared to existing methods, our QAP assay provides a simple yet powerful alternative to study the mechanics of biological and biomimetic particles.},

  abstract = {We present a highly efficient simulation method for the calculation of three-dimensional quasi-static interface shapes under the influence of electric fields. The method is especially useful for the simulation of microfluidic systems driven by electrowetting on dielectrics because it accounts automatically and inherently for the highly non-trivial interface shape in the vicinity of the triple-phase contact. In particular, the voltage independence of the local contact angle predicted based on analytical considerations is correctly reproduced in all our simulations. For the calculation of the shape of the interface, the geometry is triangulated and the mesh nodes are shifted until the system energy becomes minimal. The same mesh is also used to calculate the electric field using the boundary-element method. Therefore, only the surface of the geometry needs to be meshed, and no volume meshes are involved. The method can be used for the simulation of closed systems with a constant volume (e.g., droplet-based microfluidics) while preserving the volume very precisely as well as open systems (e.g., the liquid--air interface within micro-cavities or capillaries). Additional effects, such as the influence of gravitational forces, can easily be taken into account. In contrast to other efficient simulations, such as the volume-of-fluid, level-set, or phase-field methods, ideally, sharp interfaces are obtained. We calculate interface shapes for exemplary systems and compare with analytical as well as experimental results.},

  abstract = {In digital microfluidic systems, analyte droplets (volume typically c 1{\textasciitilde}1) are transported on a planar electrode array by dielectrophoretic and electrowetting effects. While recent work has demonstrated feasibility mainly with single droplets on small arrays, these systems hold promise for commercial-scale applications by simultaneously moving many droplets on large arrays. This paper introduces a broadly applicable approach to optimally control digital microfluidic systems, i.e., software algorithms that generate a sequence of control signals for moving one or many droplets from start to goal positions in the shortest number of steps, subject to constraints such as minimum required separation between droplets, obstacles on the array surface, and limitations in the control circuitry.},

  abstract = {The feasibility of implementing pyrosequencing chemistry within droplets using electrowetting-based digital microfluidics is reported. An array of electrodes patterned on a printed-circuit board was used to control the formation, transportation, merging, mixing, and splitting of submicroliter-sized droplets contained within an oil-filled chamber. A three-enzyme pyrosequencing protocol was implemented in which individual droplets contained enzymes, deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), and DNA templates. The DNA templates were anchored to magnetic beads which enabled them to be thoroughly washed between nucleotide additions. Reagents and protocols were optimized to maximize signal over background, linearity of response, cycle efficiency, and wash efficiency. As an initial demonstration of feasibility, a portion of a 229 bp Candida parapsilosis template was sequenced using both a de novo protocol and a resequencing protocol. The resequencing protocol generated over 60 bp of sequence with 100\% sequence accuracy based on raw pyrogram levels. Excellent linearity was observed for all of the homopolymers (two, three, or four nucleotides) contained in the C. parapsilosis sequence. With improvements in microfluidic design it is expected that longer reads, higher throughput, and improved process integration (i.e., ``sample-to-sequence'' capability) could eventually be achieved using this low-cost platform.},

  abstract = {Interfaces between a water droplet and a network of pillars produce eventually superhydrophobic, self-cleaning properties. Considering the surface fraction of the surface in interaction with water, it is possible to tune precisely the contact angle hysteresis (CAH) to low values, which is at the origin of the poor adhesion of water droplets, inducing their high mobility on such a surface. However, if one wants to move and position a droplet, the lower the CAH, the less precise will be the positioning on the surface. While rigid surfaces limit the possibilities of actuation, smart surfaces have been devised with which a stimulus can be used to trigger the displacement of a droplet. Light, electron beam, mechanical stimulation like vibration, or magnetism can be used to induce a displacement of droplets on surfaces and transfer them from one position to the targeted one. Among these methods, only few are reversible, leading to anisotropy-controlled orientation of the structured interface with water. Magnetically driven superhydrophobic surfaces are the most promising reprogramming surfaces that can lead to the control of wettability and droplet guidance.},

However, achieving this without instrumentation remains challenging. Here, sensor devices for the measurement of ammonia in a liquid were developed. These were based on the fabrication of polyaniline nanoparticle films onto screen printed interdigitated electrodes using inkjet printing and their integration into a polymer microfabricated device with polytetrafluroethylene membrane and air flow path between the membrane and the sensor. Samples of ammonia in phosphate buffered saline of 52\>{$\mu$}L were measured using electrochemical impedance. While water vapour and ions from the buffer did result in a decrease in sensor impedance, this was eradicated by displacement of the headspace above the sensor with air. This, in combination with the adjustment of the sample to pH to 11 allowed the quantification of ammonia from 0 to 200\>{$\mu$}M with a limit of detection of 25\>{$\mu$}M. The device has the potential to be used for sensitive, low volume measurement applications of ammonia at point-of-test and point-of-care.},

Much of the published work continues to make little use of all the information that can be furnished by full physical modelling and analysis of the impedance spectra, and thus does not throw more than a superficial light on the processes occurring. Analysis is often restricted to estimating values of charge transfer resistances without interpretation and ignoring other electrical equivalent circuit components. In this article, the important basics of electrochemical impedance for electrochemical sensors and biosensors are presented, focussing on the necessary electrical circuit elements. This is followed by examples of its use in characterisation and in electroanalytical applications, at the same time demonstrating how fuller use can be made of the information obtained from complete modelling and analysis of the data in the spectra, the values of the circuit components and their physical meaning. The future outlook for electrochemical impedance in the sensing field is discussed.},

  abstract = {Mathematical modeling was employed for automatic, real-time interrogation and correction of amperometric electrochemical gas sensors (AES) deployed in instruments for industrial hygiene applications. The interrogation involved two steps which were analyzed using various mathematical modeling techniques to determine the ``goodness'' of the sensor and to correct its output for small changes due to aging and environmental conditions. The first interrogation was a physical interrogation of the flow path into the sensor by supplying a driving force at the face of the sensor, either by exhaled human breath, or by acoustic sound pressure applied to diffusion barriers protecting the sensor, ensuring that the flow path was sufficiently open for detection of hazardous gases. The second interrogation was an electronic interrogation of the sensor itself, achieved by applying a small potential or current pulse to the working electrode of the sensor and deconvoluting its response to make small corrections to the sensor signal. These two steps provide periodic, real-time, and automatic surveillance and correction of AES, increasing robustness, reliability and accuracy, and user confidence, while decreasing calibration frequency, maintenance, and cost-of-ownership. Validation testing over sensors of various designs indicated a greater than 98\% reliability of the sensor/instrument interrogation technique.},

Microfluidic chip technology has already proven to be functional and effective within medical applications, such as for point-of-care use. In the forensic field, one may expect microfluidic technology to become particularly relevant for the analysis of biological traces containing human DNA. This would require a number of consecutive steps, including sample work up, DNA amplification and detection, as well as secure storage of the sample. This article provides an extensive overview of microfluidic devices for cell lysis, DNA extraction and purification, DNA amplification and detection and analysis techniques for DNA. Topics to be discussed are polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on-chip, digital PCR (dPCR), isothermal amplification on-chip, chip materials, integrated devices and commercially available techniques. A critical overview of the opportunities and challenges of the use of chips is discussed, and developments made in forensic DNA analysis over the past 10--20 years with microfluidic systems are described. Areas in which further research is needed are indicated in a future outlook.},

  abstract = {Background: The use of acoustic forces to manipulate particles or cells at the microfluidic scale (i.e. acoustophoresis), enables non-contact, label-free separation based on intrinsic cell properties such as size, density and compressibility. Acoustophoresis holds great promise as a cell separation technique in several research and clinical areas. However, it has been suggested that the force acting upon cells undergoing acoustophoresis may impact cell viability, proliferation or cell function via subtle phenotypic changes. If this were the case, it would suggest that the acoustophoresis method would be a less useful tool for many cell analysis applications as well as for cell therapy. Methods:We investigate, for the first time, several key aspects of cellular changes following acoustophoretic processing. We used two settings of ultrasonic actuation, one that is used for cell sorting (10 Vpp operating voltage) and one that is close to the maximum of what the system can generate (20 Vpp). We used microglial cells and assessed cell viability and proliferation, as well as the inflammatory response that is indicative of more subtle changes in cellular phenotype. Furthermore, we adapted a similar methodology to monitor the response of human prostate cancer cells to acoustophoretic processing. Lastly, we analyzed the respiratory properties of human leukocytes and thrombocytes to explore if acoustophoretic processing has adverse effects. Results:BV2 microglia were unaltered after acoustophoretic processing as measured by apoptosis and cell turnover assays as well as inflammatory cytokine response up to 48 h following acoustophoresis. Similarly, we found that acoustophoretic processing neither affected the cell viability of prostate cancer cells nor altered their prostate-specific antigen secretion following androgen receptor activation. Finally, human thrombocytes and leukocytes displayed unaltered mitochondrial respiratory function and integrity after acoustophoretic processing. Conclusion: We conclude that microchannel acoustophoresis can be used for effective continuous flow-based cell separation without affecting cell viability, proliferation, mitochondrial respiration or inflammatory status.},

  abstract = {The ongoing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic illustrates the need for sensitive and reliable tools to diagnose and monitor diseases. Traditional diagnostic approaches rely on centralized laboratory tests that result in long wait times to results and reduce the number of tests that can be given. Point-of-care tests (POCTs) are a group of technologies that miniaturize clinical assays into portable form factors that can be run both in clinical areas ---in place of traditional tests---and outside of traditional clinical settings ---to enable new testing paradigms. Hallmark examples of POCTs are the pregnancy test lateral flow assay and the blood glucose meter. Other uses for POCTs include diagnostic assays for diseases like COVID-19, HIV, and malaria but despite some successes, there are still unsolved challenges for fully translating these lower cost and more versatile solutions. To overcome these challenges, researchers have exploited innovations in colloid and interface science to develop various designs of POCTs for clinical applications. Herein, we provide a review of recent advancements in lateral flow assays, other paper based POCTs, protein microarray assays, microbead flow assays, and nucleic acid amplification assays. Features that are desirable to integrate into future POCTs, including simplified sample collection, end-to-end connectivity, and machine learning, are also discussed in this review.},

To apply well-defined hypoxic conditions to the cells, a good understanding of the mass transport phenomena is necessary. Therefore, a complete network model of the microfluidic system is presented. This model is validated by means of micro-particle image velocimetry ({\textmu}PIV) and optical oxygen measurement with fluorescence lifetime detection. Finally, the impact of several process parameters, e.g., the gas permeability of the pump, is discussed using the developed model.},

Although, extremely useful, these tests come with some limitations. Recent advances in the field of microfluidics have brought about new and exciting opportunities for human health diagnostics, and there is now great potential for these new technologies to be applied in the field of veterinary diagnostics.

In most applications, EWOD is applied using physical wiring, which may restrict its application to implantable EWOD devices. In order to resolve this issue, we have studied and developed a wirelessly powered EWOD by using planar coils at the receiver that are fabricated out of a printed circuit board (PCB) by means of standard micro photolithography. Unlike conventional, bulky, spool coil type, the planar coil type lends itself to compact design and easy integration with EWOD chips. The present wireless powering principle is based on magnetic induction, which is very efficient when the transmitter and receiver coils are close to each other. The voltage obtained at the receiver is much higher than typically required EWOD voltages ({$>$}50V) using a high transmission frequency ({\textasciitilde}MHz). The span of the EWOD contact angle is over 40{$^\circ$}. In addition, amplitude modulation (AM) is implemented in the present wireless powering setup, followed by demodulation, in order to oscillate droplets at low frequency. This technique ensures smooth and reliable droplet movements. The wirelessly powered EWOD is used to transport a droplet and is mounted in a mini-boat which it powers and propels.},

In this study, we show that the rotation of linear aggregates of micro-particles can be achieved under the action of acoustic field pressure. This novel manipulation is investigated by tracking polystyrene beads of different sizes through the 3D imaging features of digital holography (DH). From our analysis it is understood that the positioning of the micro-particles and their aggregations are associated with the effect of bulk acoustic radiation forces. The observed rotation is instead found to be compatible with the presence of acoustic streaming patterns as evidenced by our modelling and the resulting numerical simulation. Furthermore, the rotation frequency is shown to depend on the input voltage applied on the acoustic device. Finally, we demonstrate that we can take full advantage of such rotation by combining it with quantitative phase imaging of DH for a significant lab-on-a-chip biomedical application. In fact, we demonstrate that it is possible to put in rotation a linear aggregate of erythrocytes and rely on holographic imaging to achieve a full phase-contrast tomography of the aforementioned aggregate.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting is a phenomenon that has received increasing attention in recent years. It offers much promise for applications in lab-on-a-chip devices, liquid lenses, and optical displays. The contact angle can be controlled electrically facilitating the transport of liquid droplets by electrocapillary forces. This paper focuses on the requirements of the dielectric layers in electrowetting on dielectric; firstly, to provide the required dielectric qualities, that is, sufficient dielectric strength and high capacitance and, secondly, to satisfy the surface wetting characteristics, that is, sufficiently high hydrophobicity and low contact angle hysteresis. We present experimental work that, firstly, compares the dielectric characteristics of several insulating layers and secondly, proposes silanization as a way to form hydrophobic layers for electrowetting. The relation between electrowetting and dielectric breakdown was tested by means of measuring the contact angle of a water droplet placed between two electrodes on an insulated surface. The leakage current and resistance between these electrodes were measured as a function of applied voltage for the following dielectric coatings: silicon dioxide, silicon nitride and Parylene C. We compare the contact angle response of electrowetting on octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) monolayers and plasmaenhanced chemical vapour deposition Teflon-like fluoropolymer layers. The contact angle hysteresis of the OTS monolayers is clearly lower and this results in reversible electrowetting, that is, the hydrophobicity is sufficient to avoid contact line pinning and dewetting occurs on removal of an applied potential.},

A series of characterizations were also conducted with the fabricated digital microfluidic devices. For the device fabrication, the electrodes were patterned by laser ablation of 220 nm-thick indium tin oxide (ITO) layer on a 175 {\textmu}m-thick polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate. The electrodes were insulated with a layer of 12 {\textmu}m-thick polyethylene (PE) film as the dielectric layer, and finally, a surface treatment was conducted on PE film in order to enhance the hydrophobicity. The whole digital microfluidic device has a total thickness of less than 200 {\textmu}m and is nearly transparent in the visible range. The droplet manipulation with the proposed digital microfluidic device was also achieved. In addition, a series of characterization studies were conducted as follows: the contact angles under different driving voltages, the leakage current density across the patterned electrodes, and the minimum driving voltage with different control algorithms and droplet volume were measured and discussed. The UV--VIS spectrum of the proposed digital microfluidic devices was also provided in order to verify the transparency of the fabricated device. Compared with conventional methods for the fabrication of digital microfluidic devices, which usually have opaque metal/carbon electrodes, the proposed transparent and flexible digital microfluidics could have significant advantages for the observation of the droplets on the digital microfluidic device, especially for colorimetric analysis using the digital microfluidic approach.},

Moreover, we digitally trapped multiple cell spheroids atop of the C-shaped IDTs within a closed or open microfluidic chamber. By programming the trapping nodes within a 3 x 3 C-shaped IDT array, we can precisely position cell spheroids into designed patterns. We also demonstrated that our digital acoustofluidic device can accurately control the interaction of spheroid cells and organoids with excellent biocompatibility.

  abstract = {Land use changes in urbanization, industrialization, and agricultural processes will continue to have negative impacts on water quality at all scales. The impact of land use changes on water quality is generally studied by analyzing the relationships between land use and water quality indicators. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to review and analyze the main relationships between land use and water quality, as well as to visualize the major sources and processes of water quality pollution in Malaysia. To achieve our goal, we evaluated the significance of both land use and water quality attributes used in the past studies and correlated them to understand their relationship from another angle of view. The results revealed that 87\% of the reviewed studies indicated urban land use as a major source of water pollution, while 82\% indicated agricultural land use, 77\% indicated forest land use, and 44\% indicated other land uses. However, the results of correlation analysis showed that agricultural and forest-related activities more affected water quality through their significant positive correlation with physical and chemical indicators of water quality, while urban development activities had a greater impact on water quality through altering hydrological processes such as runoff and erosion. These findings would provide decision-makers with useful information for managing water pollution processes rather than sources only.},

  abstract = {Microfluidic Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC) technologies offer tremendous miniaturization capabilities and enable innovative ways of performing biotests without the need for conventional laboratory infrastructure. These miniaturized analytical technologies experience an explosive growth worldwide. However, there appears that one of the fields of biosciences namely ecotoxicology has so far largely escaped the attention of researchers working on chip-based systems. This is in very stark contrast to rapid adoption of microfluidics across biomedicine and many other fields of biomedicine. We postulate that innovative LOC technologies are poised to open a new avenue for inexpensive and, at the same time, high-throughput and content rich ecotoxicity test protocols. The development of novel chip-based technologies, capable of performing traditional tasks in a faster, more economical and precise manner, can particularly benefit a number of areas of aquatic ecotoxicology. This work aims to highlight microfluidic Lab-on-a-Chip systems as promising new analytical technologies for aquatic ecotoxicology and water quality monitoring. We review currently existing state-of-the-art of these emerging field and provide future outlook on how aquatic ecotoxicology can benefit from adoption of microfluidic Lab-on-a-Chip devices for accelerated bioanalysis.},

  abstract = {Foodborne illness is a major public health issue that results in millions of global infections annually. The burden of such illness sits mostly with developing countries, as access to advanced laboratory equipment and skilled lab technicians, as well as consistent power sources, is limited and expensive. Current gold standards in foodborne pathogen screening involve labor-intensive sample enrichment steps, pathogen isolation and purification, and costly readout machinery. Overall, time to detection can take multiple days, excluding the time it takes to ship samples to off-site laboratories. Efforts have been made to simplify the workflow of such tests by integrating multiple steps of foodborne pathogen screening procedures into a singular device, as well as implementing more point-of-need readout methods. In this review, we explore recent advancements in developing point-of-need devices for foodborne pathogen screening. We discuss the detection of surface markers, nucleic acids, and metabolic products using both paper-based and microfluidic devices, focusing primarily on developments that have been made between 2015 and mid-2020.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) technology has been considered as a promising candidate for digital microfluidic (DMF) applications due to its outstanding flexibility and integrability. The dielectric layer with a hydrophobic surface is the key element of an EWOD device, determining its driving voltage, reliability, and lifetime. Hereby, inspired by the ionic-liquid-filled structuring polymer with high capacitance independent on thickness, namely ion gel (IG), we develop a polymer (P)-ion gelamorphous fluoropolymer, namely, PIGAF, composite film as a replaceable hydrophobic dielectric layer for fabrication of a high-efficiency and stable EWOD-DMF device at relatively low voltage. The results show that the proposed EWOD devices using the PIGAF-based dielectric layer can achieve a large contact angle ({\texttheta}) change of {$\sim$}50{$^\circ$} and excellent reversibility with a contact angle hysteresis of {$\leq$}5{$^\circ$} at a relatively low voltage of 30 Vrms. More importantly, the EWOD actuation voltage did not change obviously with the PIGAF film thickness in the range of several to tens of microns, enabling the thickness of the film to be adjusted according to the demand within a certain range while keeping the actuation voltage low. An EWOD-DMF device can be prepared by simply stacking a PIGAF film onto a PCB board, demonstrating stable droplet actuation (motion) at 30 Vrms and 1 kHz as well as a maximum moving velocity of 69 mm/s at 140 Vrms and 1 kHz. The PIGAF film was highly stable and reliable, maintaining excellent EWOD performance after multiple droplet manipulations ({$\geq$}50 cycles) or long-term storage of 1 year. The proposed EWOD-DMF device has been demonstrated for digital chemical reactions and biomedical sensing applications.},

In the presented system, the PDMS layer acts as both insulation and hydrophobic material. An electronic board controls all the signals needed for the actuation and sensing functionalities of the EWOD system. Sessile drop experiments show the saturation of the contact angle at negative bias voltage applied to the droplet. This behavior is ascribed to trapped carrier in the PDMS layer and explains the movement of the droplet toward the grounded electrode found in EWOD experiment. The procedure chosen for the drop movement achieves speed around 5cm/s with applied voltages around 200V. Detection of drop position is successfully achieved implementing the time-constant method, which evaluates the variation of electrode capacitance induced by the droplet presence on the PDMS surface corresponding to the metal electrode.},

The sensor is formed by a carbon paste electrode modified with hierarchical porous carbon and silver sulfide nanoparticles. The morphology characterization was performed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), while the chemical and electrochemistry characterization were performed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry, respectively. Under the optimized conditions, the Ag2SNPsHPC300 sensor presented a large concentration linear range of 5.9 {\texttimes} 10-7 to 1.1 {\texttimes} 10-3 mol L-1, and limit of detection of 7.0 {\texttimes} 10-8 mol L-1 using square-wave adsorptive anodic stripping voltammetry (SWAdASV) technique. The analytical response of the Ag2SNPs-HPC300 sensor was evaluated in presence of different compounds, and the results showed a RSD of 4.3\% in triplicate experiments. The applicability of the Ag2SNPs-HPC300 sensor in river water samples contaminated with cyanine showed recoveries values near 100\%. The developed method exhibited high sensitivity and selectivity, good reproducibility, repeatability and low-cost, demonstrating to be a very promising analytical alternative for determination of cyanide in this matrix.},

Furthermore, because the devices are made from cellulose or modified cellulose using inexpensive manufacturing methods, the devices can be inexpensive and disposable. The ability to carry out multiplexed analysis without external pumps using inexpensive, disposable devices makes {$\mu$}PADs ideal for point-of-care (POC) analysis. The interest in {$\mu$}PADs has led to a number of excellent comprehensive reviews in the field; in this review, we do not attempt to reference the entire field but instead seek to highlight major developments as well as areas that will be important for future development of this field.},

  abstract = {The outstanding versatility of graphene for surface functionalization has been exploited by its decoration with synthesized polypyrrole (PPy) nanoparticles (NPs). A green, facile, and easily scalable for mass production nanocomposite development was proposed, and the resulting PPy@Graphene was implemented in chemoresistive gas sensors able to detect trace levels of ammonia (NH3) under room-temperature conditions. Gas exposure for 5 min revealed that the presence of nanoparticles decorating graphene entail greater sensitivity (13-fold) in comparison to the bare graphene performance. Noteworthy, excellent repeatability (0.7\% of relative error) and a low limit of detection of 491 ppb were obtained, together with excellent longterm stability. Besides, an extensive material characterization was conducted, and vibration bands obtained via Raman spectroscopy confirmed the formation of PPy NPs, while X-ray spectroscopy (XPS) revealed the relative abundance of the different species, as polarons and bipolarons. Additionally, XPS analyses were conducted before and after NH3 exposure to assess the PPy aging and the changes induced in their physicochemical and electronic properties. Specifically, the gas sensor was tested during a 5-month period, demonstrating significant stability over time, since just a slight decrease (11\%) in the responses was registered. In summary, the present work reports for the first time the use of PPy NPs decorating graphene for gas-sensing purposes, revealing promising properties for the development of unattended gas-sensing networks for monitoring air quality.},

  abstract = {Agriculture is one of the key economic sectors in Argentina and, in the last decades, the increase in prices and competitiveness of some grains has imposed important changes. In this process, crop cultivation occupied significant extensions of land areas previously dedicated to livestock farming, which in turn have experienced intensification in terms of production through an increasing share of feedlot systems. The agriculture sector is the main NH3 emitter in Argentina, however no inventory developed locally has been thus far available. We estimated the time series 2000--2012 of NH3 emissions, both at national and spatially disaggregated levels. National NH3 emissions in 2012 amounted to 0.31 {\textpm} 0.08 Tg, with the use of mineral fertilizers accounting for 43.0\%, manure in pasture 32.5\%, manure management 23.0\% and agricultural waste burning 1.5\%. Urea use was the major source of NH3 emissions and its application on wheat and corn crops dominated the trend. Emissions from open biomass burning were estimated but not included in the national totals because of the difficulties in differentiating between agricultural (i.e., prescribed burning of savannas) and non-agricultural emission sources. Compared to this work, NH3 emissions reported by EDGAR were 83\% higher than our estimates. The time series of spatially distributed NH3 emission estimates clearly showed the effect of the expansion of cropland, the displacement of planted areas of N-fertilizes crops by competing soybean cultivation and the relocation and intensification of beef cattle production. This new inventory constitutes a tool for policies concerning the impact of agricultural activities on air quality and contributes with more accurate and updated information useful for atmospheric chemical transport modeling. The accuracy and applicability of the inventory may be improved by local studies aimed at refining the spatial disaggregation by focusing in specific areas of fertilizer application, reflecting seasonal and monthly patterns in agricultural practices and climate conditions and addressing likely changes in diets, productivity and excretion rates over time.},

In the washing step, particles are washed with buffer solution with low conductivity for dielectrophoretic based separation to avoid the adverse effects of Joule heating. Acoustic waves generated by piezoelectric material are utilized for washing, which creates standing waves along the whole width of the channel. Coupled electro-mechanical acoustic 3D multi-physics analysis showed that the position and orientation of the piezoelectric actuators are critical for successful operation. A unique mold is designed for the precise alignment of the piezoelectric materials and 3D side-wall electrodes for a highly reproducible fabrication. To achieve the throughput matching of acoustophoresis and dielectrophoresis in the integration, 3D side-wall electrodes are used. The integrated device is fabricated by PDMS molding. The mold of the integrated device is fabricated using high-precision mechanical machining. With a unique mold design, the placements of the two piezoelectric materials and the 3D sidewall electrodes are accomplished during the molding process. It is shown that the proposed device can handle the wash and dielectrophoretic separation successfully.},

The dynamic behavior of a water droplet actuated by AC-EWOD in various conditions is studied using highspeed imaging. Optimum actuation parameters such as applied frequency, switching time, and the gap between the top and bottom plates are obtained. For horizontal actuation, a high frequency (1 kHz) is used for small-droplet deformation; on the other hand, for vertical actuation, a low frequency (44 Hz) is used for large-droplet deformation. Finally, as a proof of concept, 3D manipulation of a droplet with two parallel plates is demonstrated by the combination of horizontal and vertical AC-EWOD actuation, resulting in increased space for digital microfluidics.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the optimum thickness of a hydrophobic layer for operating voltage reduction in electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) systems by investigating the effects of thickness on the surface wettability and hysteresis using atomic force microscopy (AFM). To investigate the surface wettability, the thicknesses of Cytop and Teflon layers coated with different weight percentages of Cytop and Teflon solutions are precisely measured by AFM. The contact angles of deionized water droplets on the Cytop and Teflon layers of different thicknesses are measured using an optical microscope from the side. The results of the contact angle measurements of deionized water droplets on Cytop layers indicate that layers thicker than 3 nm maintain an angle of approximately 110{\textopenbullet}; the contact angles of the drops on Cytop layers thinner than 3 nm abruptly drop and decrease as the layer becomes thinner. The Teflon layers show a similar trend to the Cytop layers, except that the critical thickness is larger (7 nm). The contact angle hysteresis for different thicknesses of Cytop and Teflon layers is investigated by the tilting plate method. The results reveal that for thin hydrophobic layers, the contact angle hysteresis is over 10{\textopenbullet} but decreases as the layer thickness increases. When the layers are thicker than 12 nm, the contact angle hysteresis is reduced by approximately 4{\textopenbullet} for Cytop and 7{\textopenbullet} for Teflon and becomes saturated. To investigate the effect of aging on the surface wettability and hysteresis, the film stability of Cytop and Teflon layers is separately tested. The initial contact angles are reduced about 1.2\% for Cytop and 1.6\% for Teflon within 1 day and then maintained up to 10 days, while the initial contact angle hysteresis is increased about 117\% for Cytop and 39\% for Teflon within a day and then maintained up to 10 days, regardless of the thickness of the Cytop and Teflon layers. Based on the results of the surface wettability and hysteresis, an optimum hydrophobic layer thickness of 12 nm is established. Finally, the thickness effects of the hydrophobic layer on the operating voltage in EWOD actuation are tested. As expected, the operating voltage for thin hydrophobic layers is lower than that for thick layers. For the Cytop layer, the saturation voltages for 12 nm, 500 nm, and 1500 nm are 80 V, 100 V, and 120 V, respectively. Similarly, for the Teflon layer, the saturation voltages for 12 nm, 600 nm, and 1600 nm are 90 V, 110 V, and 130 V, respectively. The relative differences in the saturation voltages for both materials with respect to thickness are approximately the same.},

The complexity of microfluidic devices is expected to become significant in the near future due to the need for multiple and concurrent biochemical assays on multifunctional and reconfigurable platforms. This paper presents early work on topdown system-level computer-aided design (CAD) tools for the synthesis, testing and reconfguration of microfluidic biochips. Synthesis tools map behavioral descriptions to a droplet-based microfluidic biochip and generate an optimized schedule of assay operations, the binding of assay operations to functional units, and the layout and droplet flow-paths. Cost-effective testing techniques lead to the detection of manufacturing defects and operational faults. Reconfiguration techniques, incorporated in these CAD tools, can easily bypass faults once they are detected. Thus the biochip user can concentrate on the development of the nano- and micro-scale bioassays, leaving assay optimization and implementation details to design automation tools.},

These devices enable the precise control of nanoliter volumes of biochemical samples and reagents. They combine electronics with biology, and they integrate various bioassay operations, such as sample preparation, analysis, separation, and detection. Compared to conventional laboratory procedures, which are cumbersome and expensive, miniaturized biochips offer the advantages of higher sensitivity, lower cost due to smaller sample and reagent volumes, system integration, and less likelihood of human error. This tutorial paper provides an overview of droplet-based ``digital'' microfluidic biochips. It describes emerging computer-aided design (CAD) tools for the automated synthesis and optimization of biochips from bioassay protocols. Recent advances in fluidic-operation scheduling, module placement, droplet routing, pin-constrained chip design, and testing are presented.

  abstract = {Magnetic manipulation of liquid droplets in microfluidic environment offers a promising tool for sample handling in lab-on-chip devices. Biofunctionalized ferrofluid droplets can effectively carry a measured volume of analytes or reagents on a flat microfluidic platform, executing key tasks of a micrototal analysis system ( -TAS). However, achieving precise control using on-chip miniaturized magnetic coils is challenging and requires delicate combination of operating parameters, e.g., magnetizing current and timing of switching, fluid viscosity, droplet size, etc. Here we present a numerical analysis of magnetic manipulation of an immiscible, microliter-scale ferrofluid droplet over a thin aqueous film on a solid substrate using embedded micro-electromagnet coils. The numerical model is first validated against the experimentally observed droplet trajectory in a simple, single-coil configuration. Subsequently, twodimensional manipulation of the ferrofluid droplets on the liquid film is predicted numerically when the magnetic field is produced by a sequentially switched array of square spiral microelectromagnets. By adjusting the operating parameters, we show that the droplet can be moved in predefined meandering path over an active substrate area. The transport is broadly classified into viscosity- and inertia-influenced regimes. Transport time of the droplet for the viscous regime is expressed in terms of a generalized groupvariable involving the operating parameters. The study is important for selecting the design bases for a magnetically manipulated sample handling system for digital microfluidic platforms.},

The effects of particle size and concentration on interfacial areas are included in the model to analyze the wetting characteristics. Experiments are also conducted with submicron-sizes latex beads, in an effort to elucidate the related phenomena. It is further postulated that these beads act as suspended dielectrics in the droplet, thereby mimicking a system of two capacitors in series.

This article presents the characteristics of EWOD device with aluminum oxide (Al2O3, er \& 10) deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD), for the first time as the high-k dielectric for lowering the EWOD driving voltage substantially. The EWOD device of the single-plate configuration was fabricated by several steps for the control electrode array of 1 mm 9 1 mm squares with 50 lm space, the dielectric layer of 1,270 A{\r{}} thick ALD Al2O3, the reference electrode of 20 lm wide line electrode, and the hydrophobic surface treatment by Teflon-AF coating, respectively. We observed the movement of a 2 ll water droplet in an air environment, applying a voltage between one of the control electrodes and the reference electrode in contact with the droplet. The droplet velocity exponentially depending on the applied voltage below 15 V was obtained. The measured threshold voltage to move the droplet was as low as 3 V which is the lowest voltage reported so far in the EWOD researches. This result opens a possibility of manipulating droplets, without any surfactant or oil treatment, at only a few volts by EWOD using ALD Al2O3 as the dielectric.},

  abstract = {A large amount of ammoniacal nitrogen wastewater discharged into the water body not only causes eutrophication and black and offensive odor in water, but also increases the difficulty and cost of water treatment, and even produces toxic effects on people and organisms. In this paper, degradation of ammoniacal nitrogen wastewater by the system of ultrasound/Mg/Al2O3/ozone (US/Mg/Al2O3/O3) was carried out. The effects of different influencing factors, such as initial pH of the solution, reaction time, temperature, catalyst addition, ozone flow rate, and ultrasonic intensity, on the degradation of ammoniacal nitrogen wastewater were investigated. The optimum reaction conditions were determined. The combination of ultrasonic technology and ozone oxidation technology can enhance the mass transfer of ozone and generate a large amount of HO{$\bullet$}. Due to Mg/ Al2O3 catalyst has large surface area, the number of reactive sites and reaction molecule transport channels per unit area increases, resulting in the increase of HO{$\bullet$} on the surface, thus improving the catalytic activity. The introduction of ultrasound promotes the cleavage of N--H bonds on the catalyst surface, thereby promoting the degradation of ammoniacal nitrogen in the water. Results prove that there is not only a synergistic effect between ultrasound and catalytic ozone oxidation, but a strengthening effect of ultrasound on catalytic ozone oxidation. The research carried out in this paper provides a theoretical basis for the degradation of ammoniacal nitrogen in water.},

Starting from the onset of thin-film behavior (or equivalently beyond the inertia-dominated initial stage), we identify the existence of mutually contrasting multiple scaling regimes defining the spreading behavior at different time scales. This is attributable to the time-stage-wise upsurge of capillarity or thermocapillarity over the other. In particular, the spreading behavior is characterized by the foot-width (w) evolution with time (t) in a power-law fashion w {$\sim$} t{$\alpha$}, with {$\alpha$} being the spreading exponent, defining the rate of spreading. Following pertinent thin-film and subsequent similarity analysis, we identify different asymptotes of {$\alpha$} over disparate temporal scales, leading to the characterization of different scaling regimes over the entire spreading event starting from the inception of thin-film behavior. Reported literature data are found to correspond well to the present interpretations and estimations.},

  abstract = {The electrochemical reduction of nitrate and ammonium ion oxidation has been performed with the cathode (Al) and anode (Ti/RuO2) in the explosive industry wastewater polluted with a significant quantity of NO3- and NH4+. For this, the influences of various other cathode materials (Fe, Cu, and C), the current density (j = 35.71 to 142.86 A m-2), wastewater pH (pH = 3-12), and treatment time (t = 180 min) were analyzed for nitrate ion reduction, ammonium ion oxidation, nitrite ion generation, and total nitrogen (TN) degradation. The maximum nitrate removal and TN removal efficiencies were found to be {$\approx$}51 and {$\approx$}63\% at j = 142.86 A m-2 and wastewater natural pH after 180 min treatment time, respectively. In this condition, SEC was calculated to be 74.4 kWh (kg NO3- reduced)-1. The mechanistic analysis suggested that the atomic hydrogen molecules, H+, and e- help in the nitrate ion reduction and the available Cl- ion in the wastewater helps in the oxidation of the ammonium ion into gaseous nitrogen through the electrochemical process. The new and used electrodes were characterized by FE-SEM, AFM, and XRD techniques. Electrodes were also characterized within untreated and treated wastewater through CV and EIS analysis. The in situ generated oxidizing species were identified by the pnitrosodimethylaniline (RNO) bleaching test. Pseudo-first-order and nth-order kinetic models were applied, and the reaction rate was calculated to understand the reaction rate of the nitrate reduction. The approximate operational cost estimation has been performed for the lab-scale batch reactor treatment of the explosive industry wastewater. No scum or sludge was produced throughout the treatment process. This study helps to understand the parametric, mechanistic, and kinetic aspects of electrochemical nitrate reduction and oxidation of the previously present and produced ammonium ion in the explosive industry wastewater.},

As a lab-on-a-chip (LOC) technology, microfluidics has been enriched by the integration of various detection tools for analyte detection and quantitation. The application of such microfluidic platforms is greatly increased in the area of biosensors geared towards point-of-care diagnostics. Together, the merger of microfluidics and biosensors has generated miniaturized devices for sample processing and sensitive detection with quantitation. We believe that microfluidic biosensors (biosensors-on-chip) are essential for developing robust and cost effective point-of-care diagnostics. This review is relevant to a variety of disciplines, such as medical science, clinical diagnostics, LOC technologies including MEMs/NEMs, and analytical science. Specifically, this review will appeal to scientists working in the two overlapping fields of biosensors and microfluidics, and will also help new scientists to find their directions in developing point-of-care devices.},

Resembling nonpolar electrolytic capacitors, the two opposing metal-dielectric layers always counterbalance each other so that voltages of any polarity can be applied without current flow. By using tantalum pentoxide as the valve metal oxide for experimental evaluation, the mirrored configuration is compared with the usual configuration and further compared with silicon oxide and silicon nitride, which are two dielectric materials commonly used for EWOD. Experiments with a range of applied biases confirm that in a mirrored configuration, one of the two metal-dielectric-electrolyte combinations is always reverse-biased to prevent the current leakage, which is the most common mode of failure for the EWOD devices. The utility is demonstrated by manipulating droplets of KCl solution on both the parallel-plate and one-plate EWOD devices.},

A numerical model accounting for sensor geometry, test-piece geometry and real permittivity, and metal electrode thickness has been developed to calculate the capacitance of the sensors when in contact with a planar test-piece comprising up to four layers. Compared with a disk-and-ring coplanar capacitive sensor developed previously, the interdigital configurations are predicted to have higher signal-to-noise ratio and better accuracy in materials characterization. The disk-and-ring configuration, on the other hand, possesses advantages such as deeper penetration depth and better immunity to lift-off variations.},

  abstract = {This paper demonstrates an integrated device combining both EWD droplet actuation and intra-droplet magnetic bead manipulation. Magnetic bead manipulation is achieved by using current-carrying wires acting as microelectromagnets. The current wire structure is capable of segregating and separating magnetic beads within a droplet. By adjusting the amount of current in the wire structure, high segregation efficiency within the droplet is shown and the separation of two kinds of beads is realized within a distance of 65 {\textmu}m. The EWD droplet actuation function and the magnetic bead separation function can be operated independently, which provides flexibility when designing operation protocols. The current wire structure is embedded in an EWD electrode without affecting droplet actuation. The vertical structure of the device and its fabrication process are also the same as a normal EWD device. Magnetic bead segregation efficiency of 96.8 \% was achieved for 2.8-{\textmu}m beads that were collected over a distance of 65 {\textmu}m during a 20-s current pulse. Droplet splitting is shown to allow complete separation of beads into one of the two daughter droplets. And, intra-droplet separation of 1- and 2.8-{\textmu}m beads was demonstrated over an average distance of 65 {\textmu}m. This experiment shows the feasibility of performing separation in droplets with a complex mixture of multiple beads, each having different magnetic contents.},

Using a combination of experiment and modeling, we investigate the behavior of the threshold force required for droplet mobilization and the speed after depinning as a function of the droplet size, the applied thermal gradient and the liquid material parameters. The experimental results are well described by a hydrodynamic model based on earlier work by Ford and Nadim. The model describes the steady motion of a two-dimensional droplet driven by thermocapillary stresses including contact angle hysteresis. The results of this study highlight the critical role of chemical or mechanical hysteresis and the need to reduce this retentive force for minimizing power requirements in microfluidic devices.},

  abstract = {Actuation voltage is critical in microfluidic manipulation using electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) and liquid dielectrophoresis (LDEP). Compared to parallel electrode devices, the liquid manipulation of coplanar electrodes requires a higher actuation voltage due to its structure. This study derives an equation related to the threshold actuation voltage and all important parameters (droplet volume, fluid permittivity, fluid conductivity, applied frequency, surface tension, thickness and permittivity of dielectric materials, and electrode width). The equation is also used to analyze and explain frequency-dependent, and conductivity-dependent threshold actuation voltage on a coplanar electrode structure in the experiment. Three water-based solutions with different electrical conductivities (3 *10 4-10 2 S/m) were tested for the threshold voltage of liquid actuation using a wide range of signal frequencies (0.1--100 kHz). The theoretical and experimental data reveal that our model can successfully explain the effects of conductivity and frequency on liquid actuation. In addition, the effects of EWOD and LDEP on the threshold actuation voltage of microfluidics on a one-plate device are also discussed with the model and experiment. This study covers a common range for important parameters (applied frequency, and fluid conductivity) related to the actuation voltage in microfluidic actuation on a coplanar electrode structure. The theory and experimental data can be used to predict the applied voltage of EWOD and LDEP for a broad range of buffers and organic solvents.},

  abstract = {Early screening of pathogenic bacteria is a key to prevent and control of foodborne diseases. In this study, we developed a fast and sensitive bacteria detection method integrating electrochemical impedance analysis, urease catalysis with microfluidics and using Listeria as model. The Listeria cells, the anti-Listeria monoclonal antibodies modified magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), and the anti-Listeria polyclonal antibodies and urease modified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were incubated in a fluidic separation chip with active mixing to form the MNP-Listeria-AuNP-urease sandwich complexes. The complexes were captured in the separation chip by applying a high gradient magnetic field, and the urea was injected to resuspend the complexes and hydrolyzed under the catalysis of the urease on the complexes into ammonium ions and carbonate ions, which were transported into a microfluidic detection chip with an interdigitated microelectrode for impedance measurement to determine the amount of the Listeria cells. The capture efficiency of the Listeria cells in the separation chip was {$\sim$}93\% with a shorter time of 30 min due to the faster immuno-reaction using the active magnetic mixing. The changes on both impedance magnitude and phase angle were demonstrated to be able to detect the Listeria cells as low as 1.6 102 CFU/mL. The detection time was reduced from original {$\sim$}2 h to current {$\sim$}1 h. The recoveries of the spiked lettuce samples ranged from 82.1\% to 89.6\%, indicating the applicability of this proposed biosensor. This microfluidic impedance biosensor has shown the potential for online, automatic and sensitive bacteria separation and detection.},

A stacked multilayer electrostatic printing technique was developed for making nanofiber-based microfluidic chips for water-quality testing. Nanofiber membrane matrix structures for microfluidic devices were fabricated by electrospinning. A hydrophobic barrier was then printed through electrostatic wax printing. This process was repeatedly performed to create three-dimensional nanofiber-based microfluidic analysis devices (3D-{\textmu}NMADs). Flexible printing enabled one-step fabrication without the need for additional alignment or adhesive bonding. Practical applications of 3D-{\textmu}NMADs include a colorimetric platform to quantitatively detect iron ion concentrations in water. There is also great potential for personalized point-of-care testing. Overall, the devices offer simple fabrication processes, flexible prototyping, potential for mass production, and multi-material integration.},

  abstract = {Bentonite was used as adsorbent, which was modified by aluminum cross-linking and tannin double modification (Al-Tan-Bent), and the adsorbent has excellent removal performance for ammonia nitrogen (NH4{\th}-N) from low temperature wastewater. In the experiments, the effects of adsorbent dosage, pH, contact time, and coexisting ions were analyzed in detail. The kinetic models were fitted by experimental data, and the results showed that the adsorption process of ammonia nitrogen fitted well with the pseudo-second order kinetic model. Langmuir adsorption isotherm has higher correlation coefficient (R2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.9992), the saturated adsorption capacity was 5.85 mg/g at low temperature. Electrostatic adsorption is the main mechanism for removing ammonia (NH4{\th}), and the whole reaction was spontaneous and exothermic. Different preparation conditions of adsorbent were also analyzed: tannin concentration, temperature, pH and reaction time. The best preparation conditions for ammonia nitrogen removal were: 2 g/L of the modified concentration, pH {$\frac{1}{4}$} 7.5, modification time at 1 h and room temperature (25 C) respectively. The adsorbents were characterized by Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), BrunauereEmmetteTeller (BET) surface area and Zeta potential. The presence of tannin on bentonite and the effects of different modified pH were confirmed. The sedimentation of the sample was significantly improved.},

  abstract = {This paper reports a novel method to enhance solder ball or solder ring bonding strength by using electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) effect. With a low melting point, the metal Sn has been widely used in electronic packaging technology. Since Sn will be molten into liquid when the temperature is increased above the melting point, the method for treating liquid can be herein employed. Contact angle of the molten Pb-free balls or ring structure on silicon substrate have been experimentally changed by applying electric field across the thin dielectric film between the molten solder and the conductive silicon substrate. The contact area between the solder and the substrate is enlarged due to the decrease of the contact angle. Our testing results on the EWOD enhanced packaging structures of solder balls, flip-chip and solder ring hermetic package generally show about 50\% enhancement in bonding shear strength. The significantly enhanced solder link bonding strength is hopeful for improving packaging reliability and is promising to be used in high performance silicon based electronic or microelectromechanic SiP (system in package) technologies.},

  abstract = {As digital microfluidics (DMF) becomes a popular approach to automating biochemical reactions for various fields, its applications requiring numerous droplets with high volume consistence in parallel analysis still present a great challenge. DMF conventionally utilizes the three-electrode method to split droplets one by one -- it has low throughput and noticeable droplet volume variations. To address this challenge, a novel splitting method with a zigzag row-electrode design on electrowetting-based DMF chips is proposed. The liquid is first stretched on the row-electrode, then split by the electrode array. The row-electrode promotes the meniscus filling phenomena, providing larger overlapping areas, thereby stabilizing the volume of droplets generated. Twenty (20) droplets of 6--8 nL with the volumetric coefficient of variance (CV) at only 1.26\% are simultaneously generated, excluding the droplets at both ends. Theoretical analysis is developed and validated by the experiments to realize the relationship of important geometrical parameters. This method can not only rapidly produce multiple daughter droplets with excellent droplet volume consistence, but also preserve the common DMF fabrication and actuation scheme without modification. It shows great promise for the DMF applications that require highthroughput downstream processes.},

In this paper, the lattice Boltzmann method is adopted to investigate the pool boiling heat transfer on electrowetting surfaces with different electrode configurations. The wettability of the baseline hydrophobic surface above the electrode will change to hydrophilicity once a voltage is applied. The differences in heat transfer and boiling phenomenon between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces without electrodes are illustrated firstly by the density contours and boiling curves. Then, the possibility of electrowetting in improving the heat transfer coefficient (HTC) and critical heat flux (CHF) is verified by comparing with baseline hydrophobic and patterned-coating surfaces, and different boiling heat transfer regimes are illustrated in detail. Furthermore, based on the heat transfer characteristics of the electrowetting surfaces with different electrode configurations, a surface with temperature-dependent electrodes is obtained to comprehensively enhance heat transfer from the onset of nucleate boiling (ONB) to CHF.},

  abstract = {The invention of microfluidic lab-on-a-chip alleviates the burden of traditional biochemical laboratory procedures which are often very expensive. Device miniaturization and increasing design complexity have mandated a shift in digital microfluidic lab-on-a-chip design from traditional manual design to computer-aided design (CAD) methodologies. As an important procedure in the lab-on-a-chip layout CAD, the lab-on-a-chip component placement determines the physical location and the starting time of each operation such that the overall completion time is minimized while satisfying nonoverlapping constraint, resource constraint, and scheduling constraint. In this paper, a multiscale variation-aware optimization technique based on integer linear programming is proposed for the lab-on-a-chip component placement. The simulation results demonstrate that without considering variations, our technique always satisfies the design constraints and largely outperforms the state-of-the-art approach, with up to 65.9\% reduction in completion time. When considering variations, the variation-unaware design has the average yield of 2\%, while our variation-aware technique always satisfies the yield constraint with only 7.7\% completion time increase.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Microfluidic chip devices and their application to sensitive chemical and biological analyses have attracted significant attention over the past decade. The miniaturization of reaction systems offers practical advantages over conventional benchtop systems. In this case, however, a highly sensitive on-chip detection method is important for the monitoring of chemical reactions as well as for the detection of analytes inside the channel because the detection volume in a micrometer-size channel is extremely small. Recently, a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) technique is being regarded as a potential candidate for the highly sensitive detection of analytes in a microfluidic chip. This review provides a general survey and an in-depth look at recent developments in SERS techniques for the biological/environmental analysis of minute analytes in a microfluidic chip.},

  abstract = {Electrical impedance biosensors are powerful and continuously being developed for various biological sensing applications. In this line, the sensitivity of impedance biosensors embedded with microfluidic technologies, such as sheath flow focusing, dielectrophoretic focusing, and interdigitated electrode arrays, can still be greatly improved. In particular, reagent consumption reduction and analysis time-shortening features can highly increase the analytical capabilities of such biosensors. Moreover, the reliability and efficiency of analyses are benefited by microfluidics-enabled automation. Through the use of mature microfluidic technology, complicated biological processes can be shrunk and integrated into a single microfluidic system (e.g., lab-on-a-chip or micro-total analysis systems). By incorporating electrical impedance biosensors, hand-held and bench-top microfluidic systems can be easily developed and operated by personnel without professional training. Furthermore, the impedance spectrum provides broad information regarding cell size, membrane capacitance, cytoplasmic conductivity, and cytoplasmic permittivity without the need for fluorescent labeling, magnetic modifications, or other cellular treatments. In this review article, a comprehensive summary of microfluidics-based impedance biosensors is presented. The structure of this article is based on the different substrate material categorizations. Moreover, the development trend of microfluidics-based impedance biosensors is discussed, along with difficulties and challenges that may be encountered in the future.},

  abstract = {The development of microfluidic devices for lab-on-a-chip applications has largely been limited by a lack of flexible control and intensive mixing. The fusion of acoustics and microfluidics, termed acoustofluidics, has been demonstrated to be a promising tool for precisely manipulating micro-/nanoscale fluids and objects. When introducing sharp-edges inside the microchannel of acoustofluidic devices, the sound waves can drive highly controllable streaming flows via oscillating these microsolid structures. Considering its precise fluid control, simple device design, greatly reduced reaction duration, contactless operation, and good biocompatibility, sharp-edge acoustofluidics has demonstrated superior on-chip mixing and pumping performance for many application fields. Herein, we provide a comprehensive overview of the research and development of sharp-edge acoustofluidics. In particular, we discuss the design principles and underlying physics of sharp-edges, summarize the existing different types of sharp-edge microreactors (including sidewall wedge, sidewall rod, off-sidewall sharp-edges, and inlet conjunction needle), and highlight established applications of sharp-edge acoustofluidic technology in materials synthesis, bioliquefaction, enzyme bioassay, biomanipulation, and cell lysis. Finally, we point out the current challenges and future directions for inspiring further research in this field. The scope of this work is not only to provide an in-depth understanding of the state-of-the-art sharp-edge acoustofluidics, but also to inspire research efforts on the development of advanced on-chip platforms to satisfy the demanding needs of both academic and industrial communities.},

The results of Keynote-189 phase III clinical trial showed that chemotherapy drug plus immunotherapy drug reduced mortality compared with chemotherapy drug alone, in which the underlying mechanism has not been well demonstrated. The treatment combination also needs to be tuned for each patient, i.e., personalized medicine. Tumor-on-a-chip aims to mimic the tumor microenvironment (TME) with an in-vitro lung cancer-immune model to provide a potential solution for this application. Gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA)-cancer cells were driven on the ITO electrode track using liquid dielectrophoresis (LDEP) to form the tumor-like hydrogel. Jurkat T cells surrounded the solidified GelMA-A549 cells, resembling the cancer-immune microenvironment. The immune-cell infiltration phenomena of Jurkat T cells into the tumor were activated and enhanced via either IL-1{$\beta$}-treated A549 cells or atezolizumab (immune drugs) on the tumor lab chip. The death of cancer cells significantly increased {\textasciitilde}35\% after chemo/immunotherapy combination treatment compared with the single treatment. The distribution of dead cancer cells treated with chemo/immunotherapy revealed their distinct theoretical mechanisms, indicating the promising application of this tumor lab chip for cancer patients in personalized medicine treatments.},

This sensor comprises a printed circuit board (PCB) with configuration of two interpenetrating comb electrodes. The comb electrode is 70--80 mm width, 300 mm height with 1--2 mm spacing between each comb. This configuration of electrode causes the capacitance between comb electrodes to vary by the water level. Microcontroller is used to calculate the capacitance between comb electrodes in terms of a discharge time correlated to the water level. A practical water level measurement technique using two comb electrodes designated as level and reference sensors is presented. This technique can directly be applied to water with different conditions without recalibration. This sensor is able to measure absolute levels of water with 0.2 cm resolution over 30 cm range. In addition, it is also sensitive enough to trace the variability of water level. A flood monitoring simulation is carried out in wave flume where this sensor is used to detect the rising wave.},

  abstract = {Surfactant-containing water droplets were produced using a 75-Vrms pondermotive force operating at 10 kHz. Heat from a 30-V direct-current source, applied to a 2 {\texttimes} 0.1-mm region of the fluid, was instrumental in rupturing a low-surface-energy liquid membrane and forming the droplet. The low voltage allows quick and accurate dispensing of droplets without dielectric breakdown. Nanoliter-sized ({\textasciitilde}7.6-nL) butanol-styrene droplets were formed using 133 Vrms at 900 Hz. Microliter-sized oil droplets ({\textasciitilde}0.6 to 10.5 {$\mu$}L) were formed using high voltage (460 to 672 Vrms at 100 Hz). Oil-water emulsions were formed and moved horizontally, overcoming frictional and surface tension forces. Large oil droplets were also moved to a wider electrode spacing, where the emulsion can take the spherical shape of a target. This was only achieved by transporting the emulsion down an inclined slope (45 deg) using gravity to augment the electric force. All the steps are in place to form targets from oil-water-oil and water-oil-water emulsions; only the dielectrophoretic centering and polymerization processes, which were demonstrated previously, must be added.},

  abstract = {Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) combine high electrical conductivity with high surface area and chemical stability, which makes them very promising for chemical sensing. While water quality monitoring has particularly strong societal and environmental impacts, a lot of critical sensing needs remain unmet by commercial technologies. In the present review, we show across 20 water monitoring analytes and 90 references that carbon nanotube-based electrochemical sensors, chemistors and field-effect transistors (chemFET) can meet these needs. A set of 126 additional references provide context and supporting information. After introducing water quality monitoring challenges, the general operation and fabrication principles of CNT water quality sensors are summarized. They are sorted by target analytes (pH, micronutrients and metal ions, nitrogen, hardness, dissolved oxygen, disinfectants, sulfur and miscellaneous) and compared in terms of performances (limit of detection, sensitivity and detection range) and functionalization strategies. For each analyte, the references with best performances are discussed. Overall, the most frequently investigated analytes are H+ (pH) and lead (with 18\% of references each), then cadmium (14\%) and nitrite (11\%). Micronutrients and toxic metals cover 40\% of all references. Electrochemical sensors (73\%) have been more investigated than chemistors (14\%) or FETs (12\%). Limits of detection in the ppt range have been reached, for instance Cu(II) detection with a liquid-gated chemFET using SWCNT functionalized with peptide-enhanced polyaniline or Pb(II) detection with stripping voltammetry using MWCNT functionalized with ionic liquid-dithizone based bucky-gel. The large majority of reports address functionalized CNTs (82\%) instead of pristine or carboxyl-functionalized CNTs. For analytes where comparison is possible, FETbased and electrochemical transduction yield better performances than chemistors (Cu(II), Hg(II), Ca(II), H2O2); non-functionalized CNTs may yield better performances than functionalized ones (Zn(II), pH and chlorine).},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a high-performance droplet router for digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) design. Due to recent advancements in bio-MEMS, the design complexity and the scale of a DMFB are expected to explode in near future, thus requiring strong support from CAD as in conventional VLSI design. Among multiple design stages of a DMFB, droplet routing which schedules the movement of each droplet in a time-multiplexed manner is a critical challenge due to high complexity as well as large impacts on performance. Our algorithm first routes a droplet with higher bypassibility which less likely blocks the movement of the others. When multiple droplets form a deadlock, our algorithm resolves it by backing off some droplets for concession. A final compaction step further enhances timing as well as fault-tolerance by tuning each droplet movement greedily. Experimental results on hard benchmarks show that our algorithm achieves over 35x and 20x better routability with comparable timing and fault-tolerance than the popular prioritized A* search [2] and the state-of-the-art network-flow based algorithm [18], respectively.},

This platform features (a) a 90 Pogo pin interface for digital microfluidic control, (b) an integrated (and motorized) photomultiplier tube for chemiluminescent detection, and (c) a magnetic lens assembly which focuses magnetic fields into a narrow region on the surface of the DMF device, facilitating up to eight simultaneous digital microfluidic magnetic separations. The new platform was used to implement a three-level full factorial design of experiments (DOE) optimization for thyroid-stimulating hormone immunoassays, varying (1) the analyte concentration, (2) the sample incubation time, and (3) the sample volume, resulting in an optimized protocol that reduced the detection limit and sample incubation time by up to 5-fold and 2-fold, respectively, relative to those from previous work. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a DOE optimization for immunoassays in a microfluidic system of any format. We propose that this new platform paves the way for a benchtop tool that is useful for implementing immunoassays in near-patient settings, including community hospitals, physicians' offices, and small clinical laboratories.},

  abstract = {A new droplet-driving scheme for digital microfluidics termed the ``pre-charging of a droplet'' is demonstrated. In this method, a droplet is initially charged by applying ``pre-charging'' voltage between the droplet and an electrode buried under dielectric layers. The droplet is then driven to the next electrode by applying ``driving'' voltage between two adjacent buried electrodes. The concept of pre-charging was proved by the polarity of the charge stored in the droplet. When the droplet is precharged with positive voltage, it is driven with negative voltage and vice versa. Therefore, the magnitudes of the pre-charging and driving voltages are identical, but only with the opposite polarity. A 2.5-lL deionized water droplet is pre-charged and driven at a minimal voltage of 12 V. The charge stored in the droplet by this pre-charging method remained for more than 2 min, and the driving actuation could be repeated more than 150 times while the droplet remained its charged state. This method suggests a new means of driving a droplet for digital microfluidics at a relatively low voltage by utilizing both the electrostatic and dielectrophoretic force in the droplet transport process with a simpler structure compared to other single-plate structured devices.},

Here, we propose a multifunctional micropattern array capable of isolating individual target molecules into partitions and simultaneous on-site cell lysis to achieve a direct DNA extraction and digitized quantification thereof. The multifunctional micropattern array is fabricated by the deposition of a copolymer film, poly(2dimethylaminomethyl styrene-co-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pDH), directly on a microfluidic chip surface via the photoinitiated chemical vapor deposition process, followed by hydrophobic microcontact printing ({$\mu$}CP) to define each partition for the nucleic acid isolation. The pDH layer is a positively charged surface, which is desirable for the bacterial lysis and DNA capture, while showing exceptional water stability for more than 24 h. The hydrophobic {$\mu$}CP-treated pDH surface is stable under aqueous conditions at a high temperature (70 {$^\circ$}C) for 1 h and enables the rapid and reliable formation of thousands of sessile microdroplets for the compartmentalization of an aqueous sample solution without involving bulky and costly microfluidic devices. By assembling the multifunctional micropattern array into the microfluidic chip, the isothermal amplification in each partition can detect DNA templates over a concentration range of 0.01-2 ng/{$\mu$}L. The untreated bacterial cells can also be directly compartmentalized via the microdroplet formation, followed by the on-site cell lysis and DNA capture on the compartmentalized pDH surface. For Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enteritidis, and Staphylococcus aureus cells, cell numbers ranging from 1.4 {\texttimes} 104 to 1.4 {\texttimes} 107 can be distinguished by using the multifunctional micropattern array, regardless of the cell type. The multifunctional micropattern array developed in this study provides a novel multifunctional compartmentalization method for rapid, simple, and accurate digital nucleic acid assays.},

This study investigates such enhancements via an openstructure design and a capacitive feedback system. It has a femto-farad level resolution and demonstrates a high operating speed (approximately 10 ms), effective ink dosing, and large color area change (approximately 92\%). The feedback system for the precise control of the color area is verified by testing under a wide range of interfacial tension. The system reduces the deviation of color contrast by 85\%. Working with high fidelity with large disturbances, which are represented by interfacial variations, the system shows robust performance against other disturbances, such as temperature variation and contact angle hysteresis.},

The concepts were tested with three types of droplets at the volume of 0.75{\textasciitilde}1.5 {\textmu}L, which is usually difficult to transfer through an orifice. The integration of electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) with paper-based microfluidics was demonstrated: the droplet could be transported within 10 s. More importantly, most of the core droplet ({\textasciitilde}97\%) was extracted and passed through with only minimal shell droplets accompanying it.},

  abstract = {In biometric and biomedical applications, a special transporting mechanism must be designed for the micro total analysis system (mTAS) to move samples and reagents through the microchannels that connect the unit procedure components in the system. An important issue for this miniaturization and integration is the microfluid management technique, i.e., microfluid transportation, metering, and mixing. In view of this, an optimal fuzzy sliding-mode control (OFSMC) based on the 8051 microprocessor is designed and a complete microfluidic manipulated biochip system is implemented in this study, with a pneumatic pumping actuator, two feedbacksignal photodiodes and flowmeters for better microfluidic management. This new technique successfully improved the efficiency of biochemical reaction by increasing the effective collision into the probe molecules as the target molecules flow back and forth. The new technique was used in DNA extraction. When the number of Escherichia coli cells was 2 102--104 in 25 ml of whole blood, the extraction efficiency of immobilized beads with solution flowing back and forth was 600-fold larger than that of free beads.},

The effect of the ZC-GO content on the properties of PBI/ZC-GO composite membranes for direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) applications was investigated. The structure of ZC-GO was confirmed using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and the purity and structure of PBI were investigated using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. With increasing ZC-GO content, the proton conductivity, methanol permeability, water uptake, and swelling ratio of the composites increased, whereas the thermal stability decreased. Notably, the composite membrane containing 25 wt\% ZC-GO exhibited a high proton conductivity (4.12 10 2 S cm 1 at 90 {$^\circ$}C and RH 100\%) and low methanol permeability (1.38 10 7 cm2 s 1 at 25 {$^\circ$}C), which is much lower than that of Nafion 117 under the same conditions. The excellent properties of the composite membranes can be attributed to the homogeneous dispersion of ZC-GO and the formation of proton-transport channels in the membranes. This investigation demonstrates the potential of PBI/ZC-GO composite membranes for DMFC applications.},

Propylene carbonate liquid was generated, moved, separated, and positioned, and was patterned into various English alphabetic characters. Unlike traditional printing techniques, patterns become limited and fixed, so the shape of the desired pattern cannot be modified arbitrarily. Each single English alphabetic pattern can be formed with a volume of droplet of about 100 nl; the width of the pattern can be decreased to about 0.15 mm or less. Using an EWOD system, we have implemented an open-plate L-DEP system and a two-plate L-DEP system, for the patterning of all English alphabetic characters with the same volume of liquid at a fixed voltage.},

Numerical modeling of complex physical phenomena like contact line dynamics, dynamic contact angles or contact angle hysteresis involved in these processes do challenge in a significant manner classical numerical approaches based on macroscopic Navier--Stokes partial differential equations. In this paper, we analyze the efficiency of a numerical lattice Boltzmann model to simulate basic transport operations of sub-millimeter liquid droplets in electrowetting actuated Hele-Shaw cells. We use a two-phase three-dimensional D3Q19 lattice Boltzmann scheme driven by a Shan--Chentype mesoscopic potential in order to simulate the gas--liquid equilibrium state of a liquid droplet confined between two solid plates. The contact angles at the liquid--solid--gas interface are simulated by taking into consideration the interaction between fluid particles and solid nodes. The electrodes are designed as regions of tunable wettability on the bottom plate and the contact angles adjusted by changing the interaction strength of the liquid with these regions. The transport velocities obtained with this approach are compared to predictions from analytical models and very good agreement is obtained.},

We demonstrate the full manipulation of the sample and reagents on the DMF platform, resulting in the successful amplification of 90 pg of the target DNA (0.5 ng/{\textmu}L) in less than one hour. Furthermore, we test the efficiency of an innovative mixing strategy in DMF by employing two mixing methodologies onto the DMF droplets---low frequency AC (alternating current) actuation as well as back-and-forth droplet motion---which allows for improved fluorescence readouts. Fluorophore bleaching effects are minimized through on-chip sample partitioning by DMF processes and sequential droplet irradiation. Finally, LAMP reactions require only 2 {\textmu}L volume droplets, which represents a 10-fold volume reduction in comparison to benchtop LAMP.},

The fusion of microfluidic technologies (digital microfluidics, continuous-flow microfluidics, and droplet microfluidics, just to name a few) presents great potential for overcoming the inherent limitations of each approach, while also elevating their respective strengths. This work exploits the combination of digital microfluidics (DMF) and droplet microfluidics (DrMF) on a single substrate, where DMF enables droplet mixing and further acts as a controlled liquid supplier for a high-throughput nano-liter droplet generator. Droplet generation is performed at a flow-focusing region, operating on dual pressure: negative pressure applied to the aqueous phase and positive pressure applied to the oil phase. We evaluate the droplets produced with our hybrid DMF--DrMF devices in terms of droplet volume, speed, and production frequency and further compare them with standalone DrMF devices. Both types of devices enable customizable droplet production (various volumes and circulation speeds), yet hybrid DMF--DrMF devices yield more controlled droplet production while achieving throughputs that are similar to standalone DrMF devices. These hybrid devices enable the production of up to four droplets per second, which reach a maximum circulation speed close to 1540 {\textmu}m/s and volumes as low as 0.5 nL.},

  abstract = {Poly(p-xylylene) derivatives, widely known as Parylenes, have been considerably adopted by the scientific community for several applications, ranging from simple passive coatings to active device components. Here, we explore the thermal, structural, and electrical properties of Parylene C, and further present a variety of electronic devices featuring this polymer: transistors, capacitors, and digital microfluidic (DMF) devices. We evaluate transistors produced with Parylene C as a dielectric, substrate, and encapsulation layer, either semitransparent or fully transparent. Such transistors exhibit steep transfer curves and subthreshold slopes of 0.26 V/dec, negligible gate leak currents, and fair mobilities. Furthermore, we characterize MIM (metal--insulator--metal) structures with Parylene C as a dielectric and demonstrate the functionality of the polymer deposited in single and double layers under temperature and AC signal stimuli, mimicking the DMF stimuli. Applying temperature generally leads to a decrease in the capacitance of the dielectric layer, whereas applying an AC signal leads to an increase in said capacitance for double-layered Parylene C only. By applying the two stimuli, the capacitance seems to suffer from a balanced influence of both the separated stimuli. Lastly, we demonstrate that DMF devices with double-layered Parylene C allow for faster droplet motion and enable long nucleic acid amplification reactions.},

However, there are various challenges during the translation process due to the gaps between academia and industry, especially from laboratory prototyping to industrial scale-up production, which is critical for potential commercialization. In this Perspective, based on our experience in collaboration with stakeholders, e.g., biologists, microfluidic engineers, diagnostic specialists, and manufacturers, we aim to share our understanding of the manufacturing process chain of microfluidic cartridge from concept development and laboratory prototyping to scale-up production, where the scale-up production of commercial microfluidic cartridges is highlighted. Four suggestions from the aspect of cartridge design for manufacturing, professional involvement, material selection, and standardization are provided in order to help scientists from the laboratory to bring their innovations into pre-clinical, clinical, and mass production and improve the manufacturability of laboratory prototypes toward commercialization.},

In this comprehensive review, we examine the fundamentals of piezoelectricity, piezoelectric materials, and transducers; revisit the basics of acoustofluidics; and give the reader a detailed look at recent technological advances and current scientific discussions in the discipline. Recent achievements are placed in the context of classic reports for the actuation of fluid and particles               via               acoustic waves, both within sessile drops and closed channels. Other aspects of micro/nano acoustofluidics are examined: atomization, translation, mixing, jetting, and particle manipulation in the context of sessile drops and fluid mixing and pumping, particle manipulation, and formation of droplets in the context of closed channels, plus the most recent results at the nanoscale. These achievements will enable applications across the disciplines of chemistry, biology, medicine, energy, manufacturing, and we suspect a number of others yet unimagined. Basic design concepts and illustrative applications are highlighted in each section, with an emphasis on lab-on-a-chip applications.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting refers to an electrostatically induced reduction in the contact angle of an electrically conductive liquid droplet on a surface. Most designs ground the droplet by either sandwiching the droplet with a grounding plate on top or by inserting a wire into the droplet. Washizu and others have developed systems capable of generating droplet motion without a top plate while allowing the droplet potential to float. In contrast to these designs, we demonstrate an electrowetting system in which the droplet can be electrically grounded from below using thin conductive lines on top of the dielectric layer. This alternative method of electrically grounding the droplet, which we refer to as groundingfrom-below, enables more robust droplet translation without requiring a top plate or wire. We present a concise electrical-energy analysis that accurately describes the distinction between grounded and nongrounded designs, the improvements in droplet motion, and the simplified control strategy associated with grounding-from-below designs. Electrowetting on a single planar surface offers flexibility for interfacing to liquidhandling instruments, utilizing droplet inertial dynamics to achieve enhanced mixing of two droplets upon coalescence, and increasing droplet translation speeds. In this paper, we present experimental results and a number of design issues associated with the grounding-frombelow approach.},

The miniaturization of classical ``bulky'' measurement techniques has led to the realization of complex analytical systems, including such sensors as the BioChemLab-on-a-Chip. This rapid progress in miniature devices and instrumentation development will significantly impact the practice of medical care as well as future advances in the biomedical industry.

  abstract = {With the tangible threat posed by the release of chemical and biological warfare (CBW) agents, detection of airborne pathogens is a critical military and security concern. Recent air sampling techniques developed for biocollection take advantage of Electrowetting on Dielectric (EWOD) to recover material, producing highly concentrated droplet samples. Bespoke EWOD-based digital microfluidics platforms are very well suited to take full advantage of the microlitre concentrated droplet resulting from this recovery process. In this paper we present a free-standing, fully automated DMF platform for immunoassay. Using this system, we demonstrate the automated detection of four classes of CBW agent simulant biomolecules and organisms each representing credible threat agents. Taking advantage of the full magnetic separation process with antibody-bound microbeads, rapid and complete separation of specific target antigen can be achieved with minimal washing steps allowing for very rapid detection. Here, we report clear detection of four categories of antigens achieved with assay completion times of between six and ten minutes. Detection of HSA, Bacillus atrophaeus (BG spores), MS2 bacteriophage and Escherichia coli are demonstrated with estimated limit of detection of respectively 30 ng ml-1, 4 {\texttimes} 104 cfu ml-1, 106 pfu ml-1 and 2 {\texttimes} 107 cfu ml-1. The fully-integrated portable platform described in this paper is highly compatible with the next generation of electrowetting-coupled air samplers and thus shows strong potential toward future in-field deployable biodetection systems and could have key implication in lifechanging sectors such as healthcare, environment or food security.},

However, few studies focus on their modeling, yet critical for the optimization of their sensitivity. To address this issue, we propose a comprehensive framework by developing analytical models and 2D numerical simulations of passivated interdigitated microelectrodes (IDEs) with adherent bacterial cells in electrolyte. While models provide a qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of the AC impedance spectroscopy based on the system cutoff frequencies, finite element method (FEM) simulations based on Poisson--Nernst--Planck equations enable accurate quantification of the sensitivity to bacteria versus the applied frequency thanks to modeling of complex phenomena such as ion transport, surface and space charges, multi-shell bacterial dielectric properties and sensor topology. These numerical simulations are assessed by experimental results and compared to analytical models.},

  abstract = {In the current water monitoring panorama, certain benefits are expected to arise when the modus operandum of analysis shifts from sampling-based to purely in-situ approaches. Since the appearance of the first submersible conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) probe in the 80 s, clear efforts to move towards decentralized strategies have been reported in the literature, with some having even been brought to the stage of fruitful commercialization. Among the portfolio of available analytical techniques, only a handful of approaches offer clear potential for implementation in submersible devices, in terms of adequate analytical features, autonomy, feasibility of miniaturization, and ease of portability. Electrochemical sensors have demonstrated excellent characteristics for this purpose, particularly in the detection of ions. The present review analyses electrochemical sensors that have shown an aptitude for in-situ measurements of ions, including trace metals, nutrients, and carbon species in seawater. The previous 5 years have been selected as the main period for review, although in some instances comment is made upon earlier contributions to the field or commercialized devices, where these are deemed to exemplify crucial technological advancements. There is a notable lack of electrochemical sensors being deployed in in-situ applications, and this scarcity is even more stark when seawater is considered: only a very few cases have been demonstrated under such challenging conditions. With the aim of providing inspiration towards genuine advances in the field of in-situ seawater analysis, this work also highlights some laboratory scale research as well as studies concerning other environmental waters than seawater.},

The treatment of potentiometric transient signals obtained by a single ion-selective electrode based on 18-crown-6 in a flow configuration serves for ion identification as well as quantification in binary mixtures. As a proof-of-concept alkaline, alkaline-earth, proton and ammonium cations are analysed. The developed procedure provides three exploitation points of the raw signals: (i) the complexity grade of the signals is drastically reduced, (ii) the total reconstruction of the experimental signals leads to less noisy ones, and (iii) the relationship found between the principal component scores with both increasing cation concentration (individual and binary mixtures) and type of cation is useful for qualitative and quantitative analysis. Multi-ion detection is currently a valuable characteristic for an analytical technique and the present paper provides a new approach involving the use of only one potentiometric sensor to achieve this purpose.},

  abstract = {An overview of ionophore-based electrodes for ammonium sensing critically analyzing contributions in the last 20 years and with focus in analytical applications.           ,                             The monitoring of ammonium ion concentration has gained the attention of researchers from multiple fields since it is a crucial parameter with respect to environmental and biomedical applications. For example, ammonium is considered to be a quality indicator of natural waters as well as a potential biomarker of an enzymatic byproduct in key physiological reactions. Among the classical analytical methods used for the detection of ammonium ions, potentiometric ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) have attracted special attention in the scientific community because of their advantages such as cost-effectiveness, user-friendly features, and miniaturization ability, which facilitate easy portable measurements. Regarding the analytical performance, the key component of ISEs is the selective receptor, labelled as an ionophore in ISE jargon. Indeed, the preference of an ionophore for ammonium amongst other ions (               i.e.               , selectivity) is a factor that primarily dictates the limit of detection of the electrode when performing measurements in real samples. A careful assessment of the literature for the last 20 years reveals that nonactin is by far the most employed ammonium ionophore to date. Despite the remarkable cross-interference of potassium over the ammonium response of nonactin-based ISEs, analytical applications comprising water quality assessment, clinical tests in biological fluids, and sweat monitoring during sports practice have been successfully researched. Nevertheless, there is evident difficulty in the determination of close-to-micromolar levels of ammonium in real samples with a significant potassium background level (               i.e.               , millimolar concentration). This fact has fostered the search for a large variety of ammonium ionophores over the years, which are critically inspected herein. Overall, we provide an easily readable state of the art accompanied by a comprehensive description of other types of ammonium electrodes, including commercially available units. We conclude that newer breakthroughs are still required in the field to reach the desired analytical applications.},

  abstract = {A quantitative description of the dynamics of droplet motion has been a long-standing concern in electrowetting research. Although many static and dynamic models focusing on droplet motion induced by electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) already exist, some dynamic features do not fit these models well, especially the dynamic saturation phenomenon. In this paper, a dynamic saturation model of droplet motion on the single-plate EWOD device is presented. The phenomenon that droplet velocity is limited by a dynamic saturation effect is precisely predicted. Based on this model, the relationship between droplet motion and device physics is extensively discussed. The static saturation phenomenon is treated with a double-layer capacitance electric model, and it is demonstrated as one critical factor determining the dynamics of droplet motion. This work presents the relationship between dynamics of electrowetting induced droplet motion and device physics including device structure, surface material and interface electronics, which helps to better understand electrowetting induced droplet motions and physics of digital microfluidics systems.},

Samples (e.g., blood, urine, and saliva) are collected and analyzed for various biomarkers to quickly and sensitively assess disease progression, monitor response to treatment, and determine a patient's prognosis. Processing conventional samples entails many manual time-consuming steps. Consequently, clinical specimens must be processed by skilled technicians before antigens or nucleic acids are detected, and these are often present at dilute concentrations. Recently, several automated microchip technologies have been developed that potentially offer many advantages over traditional bench-top extraction methods. The smaller length scales and more refined transport mechanisms that characterize these microfluidic devices enable faster and more efficient biomarker enrichment and extraction. Additionally, they can be designed to perform multiple tests or experimental steps on one integrated, automated platform. This review explores the current research on microfluidic methods of sample preparation that are designed to aid diagnosis, and covers a broad spectrum of extraction techniques and designs for various types of samples and analytes.},

Although a number of platforms have been specifically designed for the general public and are supported by a vast array of on-line tutorials, this subject is not normally included in university chemistry curricula. Aiming to provide the basic concepts of hardware and software, this article is focused on the design and use of a simple module to control a series of PDMS-based valves. The module is based on a low-cost microprocessor (Teensy) and opensource software (Arduino). The microvalves were fabricated using thin sheets of PDMS and patterned using CO2 laser engraving, providing a simple and efficient way to fabricate devices without the traditional photolithographic process or facilities. Synchronization of valve control enabled the development of two simple devices to perform injection (1.6 {\textpm} 0.4 L / stroke) and mixing of different solutions. Furthermore, a practical demonstration of the utility of this system for microscale chemical sample handling and analysis was achieved performing an on-chip acid-base titration, followed by conductivity detection with an open-source low-cost detection system. Overall, the system provided a very reproducible (98\%) platform to perform fluid delivery at the microfluidic scale.},

But the miniaturization of the energy-storage components is significantly limited by their energy density. Electrode materials with adequate electrochemical active surfaces are therefore required for improving performance. 2D materials with ultralarge specific surface areas offer a broad portfolio of the development of high-performance micro-supercapacitors in spite of their several critical drawbacks. An architecture engineering strategy is therefore developed to break these natural limits and maximize the significant advantages of these materials. Based on the approaches of phase transformation, intercalation, surface modification, material hybridization, and hierarchical structuration, 2D architectures with improved conductivity, enlarged specific surface, enhanced redox activity, as well as the unique synergetic effect exhibit great promise in the application of miniaturized supercapacitors with highly enhanced performance. Herein, the architecture engineering of emerging 2D materials beyond graphene toward optimizing the performance of micro-supercapacitors is discussed, in order to promote the application of 2D architectures in miniaturized energy-storage devices.},

Effect of electrooxidation potential, pH, and concentration of monomer solution on the polymeric film structure was also investigated. Characterization of poly(PyY) thin films was carried out by using cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, UV--Vis. absorption spectroscopy, and scanning tunneling microscopy. Electrocatalytical properties of prepared poly(PyY)/PGE were studied for amperometric detection of nitrite. Under optimized conditions, amperometric response of the poly(PyY) modified electrode was linearly proportional to the concentration of nitrite in the range from 1.0 10 6 to 1.0 10 4 M, with a detection limit of 5.0 10 7 M. The results indicate that the poly(PyY)/PGE exhibits a low detection limit, an acceptable linear range and a very high sensitivity. The modified electrode was tested for the amperometric determination of nitrite concentration in food samples and the results were consistent with those of the standard spectrophotometric method.},

A significant change of contact angle for the liquid droplet can result from the surface microstructures and the external electric field, without altering the chemical composition of the system. During the electrowetting process on a rough surface, the droplet exhibits a sharp transition from the Cassie--Baxter to the Wenzel regime at a low critical voltage. In this paper, a theoretical model for electrowetting is put forth to describe the dynamic electrical control of the wetting behavior at the low voltage, considering the surface topography. The theoretical results are found to be in good agreement with the existing experimental results.},

It is important to prevent the migration of liquid lubricants for moving mechanisms. This study aimed to investigate the influence of micro-grooves patterns on the migration of paraffin oil and obtain a design concept of microgrooves patterns to obstruct the migration. Microgrooves patterns with different orientations and geometric parameters were fabricated on the surface of SUS 316 stainless steel. Migration experiments of paraffin oils on each specimen were performed under various temperature gradients. The results indicated that micro-grooves patterns strongly modified the thermo-capillary migration. Micro-grooves perpendicular to the temperature gradient obstructed the migration effectively, while micro-grooves parallel to the temperature gradient accelerated the migration. The width and depth of micro-grooves influenced the migration behavior obviously, and the effects of these geometric parameters were discussed in detail.},

Sample preparation, analyte handling and labeling are primary cost concerns for traditional lab-based diagnostic systems. Lab-on-a-chip (LoC) platforms based on droplet-based microfluidics promise to integrate and automate these complex and expensive laboratory procedures onto a single chip; the cost will be further reduced if label-free biosensors could be integrated onto the LoC platforms. Here, we review some recent developments of label-free, droplet-based biosensors, compatible with ``open'' digital microfluidic systems. These low-cost droplet-based biosensors overcome some of the fundamental limitations of the classical sensors, enabling timely diagnosis. We identify the key challenges that must be addressed to make these sensors commercially viable and summarize a number of promising research directions.},

  abstract = {Precise control of the flow dynamics in a microfluidic device is of great importance for the integration of bioassays on-chip. Recently, the Self-powered Imbibing Microfluidic Pump by Liquid Encapsulation (SIMPLE) was developed in our group and integrated with biological applications. The system functions based on capillary imbibition of a working liquid (WL) into a porous material (PM), which in turn pulls a sample liquid (SL) through the connected microfluidic channel network. Analytical models describing the pumping dynamics of paper-based and channel-based systems have been presented, but no suitable analytical models have been reported for hybrid systems such as SIMPLE. Moreover, the available models were mostly limited to only describing the pumping process (i.e. flow rate) for given design parameters (i.e. paper shape, channels geometry), which still resulted in tedious trial-and-error process to optimize the chip design to achieve the desired flow rate. In this work, we developed a smart designing tool for SIMPLE-based chips that provides the design parameters necessary to obtain a targeted flow rate. An analytical model for the SIMPLE was first derived and validated, confirming its 3 main hypotheses: i) the sample flow rate is dependent on the porous material geometry but independent from the ii) porous material volume and iii) channel geometry. All experimental results were in good agreement with this model. Finally, we used our model as a prediction tool providing precise design parameters to avoid the time-consuming trial-and-error approach needed to achieve a specific flow rate. In particular, several chips were fabricated according to the model inputs and the sample liquid flow rates measured (1.5 {\textpm} 0.3, 5.3 {\textpm} 1.5, 15.2 {\textpm} 2.7 L/min) were matching the targeted ones (1.5, 5, 15 L/min). The analytical model developed in this work was proven to be a useful designing tool for fast and efficient optimization of SIMPLE-based chips in order to address specific application requirements.},

The design of interdigital capacitor (IDCs) sensor is carried out in such a way that it would be suitable for microelectronic technology. The basic geometry of IDCs is defined by some parameters such as: number of electrodes N, electrode width W, electrode length L and the separation between electrodes G. The interactions between IDCs sensitive coating and analyte induced a change in the sensors capacitance due to the permittivity variation of the sensitive layer and to the change in polymer thickness (swelling). In this work, a fairly new approach of IDCs based sensor in terms of capacitance calculation has been presented. The results have been obtained from the modeling of the sensors geometry 2D and 3D using multi-physics simulation software COMSOL. The effects of some geometry parameters coupled with polymeric films swelling measurements have been studied.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the application of machine learning techniques, specifically deep learning, to enhance the performance and reliability of electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) digital microfluidic (DMF) devices. During droplet manipulation within an EWOD DMF device, the menisci of the droplets carry valuable information, including fluid properties, droplet size, position, and dynamics. Recognizing and analyzing these droplet menisci can provide insights into reaction kinetics and device defects, enabling reliable feedback control for improved device operation. To achieve reliable control of EWOD DMF devices, this study focuses on the recognition of droplet menisci using a deep learning approach. The U-Net model, a highly effective deep learning architecture for image segmentation tasks, is integrated into the present study. A convolutional neural network with the U-Net architecture is implemented, and image segmentation is performed to accurately identify droplet menisci. The network is trained using a diverse dataset containing images of droplet under various conditions. Model parameters are optimized to ensure high accuracy and robust performance. Experimental tests are conducted on images of droplets in different conditions, and the trained network successfully recognizes menisci with a model accuracy of 98 \%.},

Numerical solutions of the flow speed as a function of downstream position show excellent agreement with experiment. The only adjustable parameter is the inlet film height, which is controlled by the ratio of the reservoir pressure to the shear stress applied to the liquid stream. In the limiting cases where this ratio is either much smaller or much larger than unity, the rivulet speed shows a power law dependency on w, {\textbar}dT/dx{\textbar} and V.

The surface wettability is highly depending on the intrinsic hydrophobicity of materials and the roughness geometry. Conducting polymers have unique properties allowing to tune the surface wettability, for example, by reversibly incorporating various hydrophobic/hydrophilic doping ions, by changing the nature of the polymerizable core or by functionalization with various hydrophobic/hydrophilic substituents. Conducting polymers are obtained by monomer oxidation using various strategies such as the chemical oxidative polymerization in solution, the electrochemical polymerization on conductive substrates or the vapor-phase polymerization, leading to have an easy control of the surface morphology at micro- or a nanoscale with a surface wettability going from superhydrophilicity to superoleophobicity.},

  abstract = {Surface acoustic wave (SAW) is a well-proven tweezer serving various applications such as particle manipulation, cell trapping and separations, fluid mixing, and biosensing. SAWs can cause significant heat generation due to acoustothermal heating as established experimentally. Theoretical understanding of acoustothermal heating is limited, primarily due to the difficulties presented by multiple time scales inherent in this phenomenon. We present a theoretical model based on a multiple scale perturbation approach to solve the fluid flow and heat transfer equations for SAW-driven acoustothermal heating of a Newtonian fluid in a microchannel. The first order fields are oscillatory with the same frequency as that of the SAW, whereas the second order components are time-averaged to account for the mean flow and temperature fields. We find that the temperature rise depends solely on the acoustic energy density and its conversion into internal energy via pressure work on the fluid and hydrodynamic transportation of heat. For a fixed aspect ratio, an increase in system size essentially increases the conversion of acoustic energy into internal energy, leading to an increase in temperature rise. On the other hand, an increase in SAW frequency for a given system size causes the acoustic energy density to increase and thereby increases the temperature rise. Temperature rise is found to increase linearly with SAW power, in agreement with experimental results reported in the literature. The quantitative model for the temperature field presented in this work will find applications in designing biosensors, microreactors, and in other SAW driven controllable digital microfluidic heating applications.},

Among nucleic-acid-based sensing techniques, loop-mediated isothermal amplification is a promising method, as it provides rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of microbial and viral pathogens and has enormous potential to transform current point-of-care molecular diagnostics. In this review, the advances in LAMP-based point-of-care diagnostics assays developed during the past few years for rapid and sensitive detection of infectious pathogens are outlined. The numerous detection methods of LAMP-based biosensors are discussed in an end-point and real-time manner with ideal examples. We also summarize the trends in LAMP-on-a-chip modalities, such as classical microfluidic, paper-based, and digital LAMP, with their merits and limitations. Finally, we provide our opinion on the future improvement of on-chip LAMP methods.

Further, various applications in different fields were also compiled in the form of text under different sections and tables. Paper-based analytical devices may serve as an excellent tool in variety of analytical works as these techniques are simple, rapid, economic, and require less human power or trainings.

Understanding of the electrostatic properties of digital microfluidics, like voltage distribution and capacitance is somewhat limited. Therefore, information about the exact applied voltage across test sample, its current position on the device is required for effective analysis.

As the requisite voltage reduction is a key challenging design issues, to implement all the tasks using triangular electrodes that are possible in square electrode arrays as well, is a tedious job. Furthermore, to deal with this new design deploying triangular electrodes, we have analyzed all the necessary decisive factors including fluidic constraints to ensure safe droplet movements and other modular operations together with mixing and routing. Moreover, an algorithm has been developed to find a route for a given source and destination pair in this newly designed DMFB.

Biochips are soon expected to revolutionize biosensing, clinical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and drug discovery. Critical to the deployment of the biochips in such diverse areas is the dependability of these systems. Thus robust testing and diagnosis techniques are required to ensure adequate level of system dependability. Due to the underlying mixed technology and mixed energy domains, such biochips exhibit unique failure mechanisms and defects. In this article efficient parallel testing and diagnosis algorithms are presented that can detect and locate single as well as multiple faults in a microfluidic array without flooding the array, a problem that has hampered realistic implementation of several existing strategies. The fault diagnosis algorithms are well suited for built-in self-test that could drastically reduce the operating cost of microfluidic biochip. Also, the proposed alogirthms can be used both for testing and fault diagnosis during field operation as well as increasing yield during the manufacturing phase of the biochip. Furthermore, these algorithms can be applied to both online and offline testing and diagnosis. Analytical results suggest that these strategies that can be used to design highly dependable biochip systems.},

Mixing is the most important operation of DMFB as the outcome of the experiment is almost dominated by mixing. A good mixing of corresponding sample and reagent gives proper result while an improper mixing leads to erroneous result, which may be the reason to discard the assay.

The mixing percentage was determined by monitoring the changing color during chemical reaction that occurs in the resultant coalesced droplet. The thermocapillary effect of the liquid substrate plays a significant role in mixing in that the liquid surface velocity and the droplet velocity increase with an increase in the surface temperature gradient. This, in turn, increases the mixing of the coalesced droplet, which is further enhanced when the drop size is smaller. Since the collision is convection dominated, an appropriate time scale is proposed, which provides a universal correlation of the nondimensional mixing time in terms of Reynolds number.},

Despite their popularity, the selection of an appropriate mechanism for droplet transport and coalescence has always been a challenge. This paper investigates the use of Marangoni flow as a mechanism for levitating and transporting droplets on immiscible liquid films at higher speeds than is possible currently. For the first time, we show that it is possible to realize the natural coalescence of droplets through Marangoni effect without any external stimulation and deliver the coalesced droplet to a certain destination through the use of surface tension gradients. The effects of shape and size on collision outcome are studied. Regions of coalescence and stretching separation of colliding droplets are delineated based on Weber number and impact number. In addition, the effect of viscosity on post collision regimes is studied. The findings in this fundamental study can be beneficial to many applications such as welding, drug delivery and microfluidics devices in controlling small droplets and targeting them to various locations.},

In contrast to the liquid--gas drop surface where thermodynamical equilibrium is instantaneously achieved, the adsorption of BSA molecules at the lubricated solid substrate can be characterized by a time-dependent solid--liquid surface pressure. As demonstrated from dynamic contact angle (DCA) imaging, adsorption of BSA is promoted under AC EWOD. A significant dependence of the solid--liquid surface pressure on the resonant capillary frequencies is observed: for a large enough actuation frequency corresponding to an oscillating mode, n = 6, numerical simulations are performed which show that corner eddies located in the Stuart boundary layer, near the oscillating contact line, yield an efficient molecular renewal. In this way, oscillating EWOD could be used purposely as a tool to speed up label-free detection from DCA measurements.},

  abstract = {The spread of infectious diseases poses a global threat to human health and the economy. Conventional laboratory-based pathogen detection analytical techniques are reliable, but are labour and time consuming. Decentralized, rapid pathogen detection and classification devices are essential to boost biosecurity efforts and can aid in the advancement of modern medicine. Here, we describe the development of an integrated digital microfluidic (DMF) electrochemical impedimetric sensor for rapid and on-site detection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a molecular signature of Gram-negative bacteria. The sensor was fabricated by immobilizing toll-like receptor protein (TLR4) onto a gold sensing electrode that was fabricated on an indium tin oxide (ITO) DMF top plate. The top plate also housed lithographically patterned ITO pseudo-reference and auxiliary electrodes for a three-electrode electrochemical impedance (EIS) detection system. We exploited the unique feature of DMF to manipulate droplets consisting of samples, buffers, wash solutions and reagents to perform automated EIS measurements due to the interaction of TLR4 with LPS. The integrated sensor platform showed a detection limit of 35 ng/mL LPS and a linear range of up to 400 ng/mL. The small size and ease of operation of the integrated system holds great prospect for the development of portable, and automated generic pathogen detection and classification platform for point-of-need applications.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidics (DMF) is a platform that enables highly reconfigurable and automated fluidic operations using a generic device architecture. A unique hallmark of DMF is its ``flexibility'': a generic device design can be used and reused for many different, divergent fluidic operations. The flexibility of DMF is compromised when devices are permanently modified with embedded sensors. Here we introduce a solution to the ``flexibility gap'' between fluidic operations in digital microfluidics and embedded sensors: ``plug-n-play DMF'' (PnP-DMF). In PnP-DMF, devices are designed to allow for rapid and seamless exchange of sensors depending on the application needs. This paper provides ``proof of concept'' for PnP-DMF using commercial biosensors for glucose and {$\beta$}-ketone, a custom paperbased electrochemical sensor for lactate, and a generic screen-printed electroanalytical cell. We demonstrate that hot-swapping sensors between experiments allows for convenient implementation of complex processes such as automated analysis of blood samples by standard addition. Finally, we explored the suitability for using PnP sensors in tandem with other sensing modalities, combining biosensor-based electrochemical measurement of glucose with a chemiluminescent magnetic bead-based sandwich immunoassay for insulin. The latter is notable, as it constitutes the first report of an analysis of different analytes in both the supernatant and precipitate from a single sample-aliquot in a microfluidic device. The results presented here highlight the versatility of PnP-DMF, illustrating how it may be useful for a wide range of applications in diagnostics and beyond.},

  abstract = {The detection of single molecules in magnetic microbead microwell array formats revolutionized the development of digital bioassays. However, retrieval of individual magnetic beads from these arrays has not been realized until now despite having great potential for studying captured targets at the individual level. In this paper, optical tweezers were implemented on a digital microfluidic platform for accurate manipulation of single magnetic beads seeded in a microwell array. Successful optical trapping of magnetic beads was found to be dependent on Brownian motion of the beads, suggesting a 99\% chance of trapping a vibrating bead. A tailormade experimental design was used to screen the effect of bead type, ionic buffer strength, surfactant type, and concentration on the Brownian activity of beads in microwells. With the optimal conditions, the manipulation of magnetic beads was demonstrated by their trapping, retrieving, transporting, and repositioning to a desired microwell on the array. The presented platform combines the strengths of digital microfluidics, digital bioassays, and optical tweezers, resulting in a powerful dynamic microwell array system for single molecule and single cell studies.},

One of the main challenges in droplet microfluidics is the precise control of the droplet motion, and existing technologies have drawbacks that can compromise the droplet contents. Here, we demonstrate how an on--off switchable ratchet topography combined with a simple actuation strategy can be exploited to accurately manipulate mm-sized droplets. Because of the mechanowetting principle, the threephase line dynamically attaches to these deforming ratchets, affecting the droplet displacement in a controlled matter. We show that such topographies are capable of transporting droplets over a surface in a stepwise fashion. We calculate the forces generated by the surface using both a theoretical description of the three-phase line and fluid simulations, and we identify the window of applicability in terms of the droplet size relative to the sawtooth dimensions. Our results enable the design of microfluidic systems with deforming wall topographies for controlled droplet manipulation.},

  abstract = {Since the Lab on a Chip concept was introduced in the 1990s, a lot of scientific advancements have occurred. However, large scale commercial realization of microfluidic technology is being prevented by the lack of standardization. There seems to be a gap between Lab on a Chip systems developed in the lab and those that are manufacturable on a large scale in a fab. In this paper, we propose a modular platform which makes use of standardized parts. Using this platform, a functional-based method of designing microfluidic systems is envisioned. To obtain a certain microfluidic function, a bottom-up design is made. This results in micro fluidic building blocks that perform a microfluidic function. This microfluidic building block is then stored in a library, ready for reuse in the future. Key characteristics are shown for several basic microfluidic building blocks, developed according to a footprint and interconnect standard by various players in the microfluidic world. Such a library of reusable and interoperable microfluidic building blocks is important to fill the gap between lab and fab, as it reduces the time-to-market by lowering prototype time cycles. The wide support of key European players active in microfluidics, which is shown by an ISO workshop agreement (IWA 23:2016), makes this approach more likely to succeed compared to earlier attempts in modular microfluidics.},

  abstract = {Biological environmental monitoring (BEM) is a growing field of research which challenges both microfluidics and system automation. The aim is to develop a transportable system with analysis throughput which satisfies the requirements: (i) fully autonomous, (ii) complete protocol integration from sample collection to final analysis, (iii) detection of diluted molecules or biological species in a large real life environmental sample volume, (iv) robustness and (v) flexibility and versatility. This paper discusses all these specifications in order to define an original fluidic architecture based on three connected modules, a sampling module, a sample preparation module and a detection module. The sample preparation module highly concentrates on the pathogens present in a few mL samples of complex and unknown solutions and purifies the pathogens' nucleic acids into a few mL of a controlled buffer. To do so, a two-step concentration protocol based on magnetic beads is automated in a reusable macro-to-micro fluidic system. The detection module is a PCR based miniaturized platform using digital microfluidics, where reactions are performed in 64 nL droplets handled by electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) actuation. The design and manufacture of the two modules are reported as well as their respective performances. To demonstrate the integration of the complete protocol in the same system, first results of pathogen detection are shown.},

Acoustic radio frequency filters, for instance, are integral parts of wireless devices. SAWs in particular find applications in life sciences and microfluidics for sensing and mixing of tiny amounts of liquids. In addition to this continuously growing number of applications, SAWs are ideally suited to probe and control elementary excitations in condensed matter at the limit of single quantum excitations. Even collective excitations, classical or quantum are nowadays coherently interfaced by SAWs. This wide, highly diverse, interdisciplinary and continuously expanding spectrum literally unites advanced sensing and manipulation applications. Remarkably, SAW technology is inherently multiscale and spans from single atomic or nanoscopic units up even to the millimeter scale. The aim of this Roadmap is to present a snapshot of the present state of surface acoustic wave science and technology in 2019 and provide an opinion on the challenges and opportunities that the future holds from a group of renown experts, covering the interdisciplinary key areas, ranging from fundamental quantum effects to practical applications of acoustic devices in life science.},

An attractive approach is optical actuation because light field interaction is contactless and dynamically reconfigurable, and solutions have been anticipated through the use of optical forces to manipulate microparticles in flows. Following the concept of "optical chip" advanced from the optical actuation of suspensions, we propose in this survey new routes to extend this concept to microfluidic two-phase flows. First, we investigate the destabilization of fluid interfaces by the optical radiation pressure and the formation of liquid jets. We analyze the droplet shedding from the jet tip and the continuous transport in laser-sustained liquid channels. In a second part, we investigate a dissipative light-flow interaction mechanism consisting in heating locally two immiscible fluids to produce thermocapillary stresses along their interface. This opto-capillary coupling is implemented in adequate microchannel geometries to manipulate two-phase flows and propose a contactless optical toolbox including valves, droplet sorters and switches, droplet dividers or droplet mergers. Finally, we discuss radiation pressure and opto-capillary effects in the context of the "optical-chip" where flows, channels and operating functions would all be performed optically on the same device.},

  abstract = {Diabetes has shown to be a chronic disease world over, mainly caused due to reduced physical activity and increased obesity. World health organization statistics show diabetes as a leading cause of disability universally. To avoid extreme medical conditions of subjects, regular monitoring of their glucose levels has been suggested. The most common method that has been in use is the pinprick method for glucose monitoring which carries the risk of contamination as well as irritation. One possible approach called noninvasive technique can be adopted to avoid this major concern. This paper presents designing Inter-Digital-Sensor (IDS) for non-invasive sensing of the glucose level. The sensor-based chip once mounted onto the upper arm or pinkie finger of diabetes subject, is able to sense different glucose levels concentration as impedance plots. A set of several simulation results has been obtained using COMSOL for getting optimized dimensions of the sensor digits. This research has presented the generation of an electric field and intensity by using electrode of known length with element spacing varying from 250{\textmu}m to 600{\textmu}m developed over 15mm x 20mm sensor area. An ID of 475{\textmu}m width spacing with ten (10) digits producing 2.33 pF of capacitance value with impedance resonating at 13 GHz of frequency is reported in this paper.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the finite element method (FEM) based performance analysis of serpentine electrodes (SREs) and interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) used for biochemical sensing applications. The SREs and IDEs structures were modelled for comparison with 20 mm (width, gap), length of 1 mm and 20 electrode pairs. The modelled SREs structure was analyzed with three diverse meshing techniques such as normal, fine, and adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). The skewness of 0.83 was found for AMR as against 0.64 and 0.57 of fine and normal mesh, respectively. Further, the electrical parameters such as signal strength, penetration depth, and electric field strength were considered to evaluate the performance of SREs and IDEs. Through simulation results, the signal strength of 4.92 pF was obtained for SREs as against 2.98 pF of IDEs. The penetration depth of 53.3 mm above electrode surface for SREs as against 26.7 mm of IDEs was obtained. Additionally, the FEM simulations were conducted for various substrate materials such as glass, FR4, Kapton{\`O} HN, and PET. Finally, a surface conductivity model in COMSOL{\`O} multiphysics was used to see the response from SREs and IDEs for varying conductivity between 0.0041 mS/cm to 12.9102 mS/cm. From simulation results, a decrease in impedance with increase in conductivity was observed validating the sensing mechanism. Moreover, a higher percentage change in impedance response was found for SREs as against IDEs for the same conductivity. Hence, this work demonstrates the importance of meshing while modelling complex electrode structures such as SREs. All the performance indicators suggest the usefulness of SREs over IDEs for biochemical analysis.},

  abstract = {The dominant forcing mechanism for particle manipulation using SSAW is shown to be spatially dependent when travelling components are considered.           ,              The use of ultrasonic fields to manipulate particles, cells and droplets has become widespread in lab on a chip (LOC) systems. There are two dominant actuation methods, the use of bulk acoustic waves (BAW) or surface acoustic waves (SAW). The development of BAW actuated systems have been underpinned by a robust understanding of the link between the ultrasonic field and forces which can be generated. In this work, we examine this link for standing surface acoustic waves (SSAW) comparing the relative strengths of streaming induced drag and acoustic radiation forces on suspended particles. To achieve this we have employed boundary conditions which accurately capture the travelling wave components of the pseudo-standing wave field, describe the key features of the acoustic radiation force fields and the acoustic streaming fields which can be generated, and finally we show that the relative importance of these two mechanisms is spatially dependant within a fluid chamber. The boundary condition used models the SSAW as two counter-propagating travelling waves, rather than assuming a standing wave directly. This allows the accurate inclusion of energy decay as the SAW couples into the fluid chamber and the resulting travelling wave component. This study shows that this previously neglected complexity of the SAW field is a critical factor in the nature of the resultant streaming field, as it gives rise to strong streaming rolls at the channel walls, which we validate experimentally. These rolls result in spatial variations of the dominant forces which in turn varies particle migration patterns spatially across the fluid domain.},

In dynamic applications, properties of both the system and the microdroplet are changing in time due to the adsorption of microdroplet species at the solid-liquid and liquid-vapor interfaces. In this paper, these digital microfluidic dynamic challenges are overcome through the introduction of real-time sensing submodules. Dynamic sampling has been added to the actuation mechanisms of the digital microfluidic system, and it is shown that the complete fluid system can be characterized simultaneously by measurements of the microfluidic system capacitance and the microdroplet contact angle.},

  abstract = {The statics of soft electrowetting is not affected by the viscoelasticity of the soft dielectric, but the dynamics is.           ,              Electrowetting is a commonly used tool to manipulate sessile drops on hydrophobic surfaces. By applying an external voltage over a liquid and a dielectric-coated surface, one achieves a reduction of the macroscopic contact angles for increasing voltage. The electrostatic forces all play out near the contact line, on a scale of the order of the thickness of the solid dielectric layer. Here we explore the case where the dielectric is a soft elastic layer, which deforms elastically under the effect of electrostatic and capillary forces. The wetting behaviour is quantified by measurements of the static and dynamic contact angles, complemented by confocal microscopy to reveal the elastic deformations. Even though the mechanics near the contact line is highly intricate, the macroscopic contact angles can be understood from global conservation laws in the spirit of Young--Lippmann. The key finding is that, while elasticity has no effect on the static electrowetting angle, the substrate's viscoelasticity completely dictates the spreading dynamics of electrowetting.},

In contrast, microfluidic chip-based technologies provide promising alternatives. The presence of environmental contaminants, especially bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens and their toxins, is creating a major public health problem. The detection of microbial communities in environmental samples is the first step to recognizing these organisms and insuring health and safety against their infection. This review addresses both the existing and innovative technologies for the detection of pathogens present in the environmental samples. First, impacts and challenges related to pathogens in the environmental samples are discussed, and standard techniques for their identification are addressed. Next, the microfluidic technologies are introduced as an alternative strategy with a particular focus on the detection of environmental contaminants. Challenges that still need to be overcome are also discussed. The review concludes with a section on paper-based microfluidic device and a discussion on future prospects.},

Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) exploits the dielectric properties of thin insulator films to enhance the charge density and hence boost the electrowetting effect. The presence of charges results in an electrically induced spreading of the droplet which permits purposeful manipulation across a hydrophobic surface. Here, we demonstrate EWOD-based protocol for sample processing and detection of four categories of antigens, using an automated surface actuation platform, via two variations of an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) methods. The ELISA is performed on magnetic beads with immobilized primary antibodies which can be selected to target a specific antigen. An antibody conjugated to HRP binds to the antigen and is mixed with H2O2/Luminol for quantification of the captured pathogens. Assay completion times of between 6 and 10 min were achieved, whilst minuscule volumes of reagents were utilized.},

Our acoustic tweezers utilize the wide resonance band of chirped interdigital transducers to achieve real-time control of a standing surface acoustic wave field, which enables flexible manipulation of most known microparticles. The power density required by our acoustic device is significantly lower than its optical counterparts (10,000,000 times less than optical tweezers and 100 times less than optoelectronic tweezers), which renders the technique more biocompatible and amenable to miniaturization. Cell-viability tests were conducted to verify the tweezers' compatibility with biological objects. With its advantages in biocompatibility, miniaturization, and versatility, the acoustic tweezers presented here will become a powerful tool for many disciplines of science and engineering.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic biochips have become one of the most promising technologies for biomedical experiments. In modern microfluidic technology, reducing the number of independent control pins that reflects most of the fabrication cost, power consumption and reliability of a microfluidic system, is a key challenge for every digital microfluidic biochip design. However, all the previous chip designs sacrifice the optimality of the problem, and only limited reduction on the number of control pins is observed. Moreover, most existing designs cannot satisfy high-throughput demand for bioassays, and thus inapplicable in practical contexts. In this paper, we propose the first optimal pin-count design scheme for digital microfluidic biochips. By integrating a very simple combinational logic circuit into the original chip, the proposed scheme can provide high-throughput for bioassays with an information-theoretic minimum number of control pins.

We introduce a new digital microfluidic (DMF) diagnostic platform with integrated porous membranes for blood-plasma separation from finger-stick blood volumes, capable of performing complex, multi-step, diagnostic assays. Importantly, the samples can be directly loaded onto the device by a finger ``dab'' for user-friendly operation. We characterize the platform by comparison to plasma generated               via               the ``gold standard'' centrifugation technique, and demonstrate a 21-step rubella virus (RV) IgG immunoassay yielding a detection limit of 1.9 IU mL               -1               , below the diagnostic cut-off. We propose that this work represents a critical next step in DMF based portable diagnostic assays---allowing the analysis of whole blood samples without pre-processing.},

While cost-effective and portable, LFAs often lack the clinical sensitivity and specificity required for accurate diagnoses. In response to this challenge, we introduce a new digital microfluidic (DMF) platform fabricated using a custom inkjet printing and roll-coating process that is scalable to mass production. The performance of the new devices is on par with that of traditional DMF devices fabricated in a cleanroom, with a materials cost for the new devices of only US \$0.63 per device. To evaluate the usefulness of the new platform, we performed a 13-step rubella virus (RV) IgG immunoassay on the inkjet printed, roll-coated devices, which yielded a limit of detection of 0.02 IU mL               -1               , well below the diagnostic cut-off of 10 IU mL               -1               for RV infection and immunity.

  abstract = {The use of acoustophoretic separation devices provides a feasible means in biomedical diagnostics for label-free separation of diseased cells. Separation via acoustophoresis, however, has been restricted mainly to size contrast. Thermally-assisted acoustophoresis, as a newly-developed approach, integrates acoustic and thermal actuators on the same platform, enabling a stiffness-based separation when adjusted properly. Using this method, we have demonstrated the possibility of separating cell-mimicking liposomes based on their membrane stiffness. In a temperature-tuned microchannel with an overlaid ultrasonic standing wave, the acoustic contrast factor of a liposome is mainly determined according to its compressibility compared to that of medium. The sign of this factor was observed to flip to a negative value at a specific temperature, unique to the composition of the liposome. This sign switch was hypothesized to be due to the thermotropic phase transitions in the liposome's membrane upon which an apparent effect on the compressibility is experienced by the liposome. By choosing the midpoint of the existing temperature window for two different compositions, within which liposomes were mechanically distinct enough to become differentiable in the acoustic radiation field, we examined the separation efficiency under different flow rate conditions.},

  abstract = {3D microblade structures were fabricated on digital microfluidic chips for precise and parallel droplet splitting of biological samples for disease diagnostics.           ,              Existing digital microfluidic (DMF) chips exploit the electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) force to perform droplet splitting. However, the current splitting methods are not flexible and the volume of the droplets suffers from a large variation. Herein, we propose a DMF chip featuring a 3D microblade structure to enhance the droplet-splitting performance. By exploiting the EWOD force for shaping and manipulating the mother droplet, we obtain an average dividing error of {$<$}2\% in the volume of the daughter droplets for a number of fluids such as deionized water, DNA solutions and DNA--protein mixtures. Customized droplet splitting ratios of up to 20\,:\,80 are achieved by positioning the blade at the appropriate position. Additionally, by fabricating multiple 3D microblades on one electrode, two to five uniform daughter droplets can be generated simultaneously. Finally, by taking synthetic DNA targets and their corresponding molecular beacon probes as a model system, multiple potential pathogens that cause sepsis are detected rapidly on the 3D-blade-equipped DMF chip, rendering it as a promising tool for parallel diagnosis of diseases.},

Capacitance variation induced by the droplet passage was thoroughly investigated with both simulation and experimental work. Olive oil and deionized water were employed as the working fluids in the experiments to demonstrate the droplet sensor. The results show a good sensitivity of the droplet with the appropriate measurement connection.

  abstract = {Temperature is a critical---yet sometimes overlooked---parameter in microfluidics. Microfluidic devices can experience heating inside their channels during operation due to underlying physicochemical phenomena occurring therein. Such heating, whether required or not, must be monitored to ensure adequate device operation. Therefore, different techniques have been developed to measure and control temperature in microfluidic devices. In this contribution, the operating principles and applications of these techniques are reviewed. Temperature-monitoring instruments revised herein include thermocouples, thermistors, and custom-built temperature sensors. Of these, thermocouples exhibit the widest operating range; thermistors feature the highest accuracy; and custom-built temperature sensors demonstrate the best transduction. On the other hand, temperature control methods can be classified as external- or integrated-methods. Within the external methods, microheaters are shown to be the most adequate when working with biological samples, whereas Peltier elements are most useful in applications that require the development of temperature gradients. In contrast, integrated methods are based on chemical and physical properties, structural arrangements, which are characterized by their low fabrication cost and a wide range of applications. The potential integration of these platforms with the Internet of Things technology is discussed as a potential new trend in the field.},

  abstract = {Self-assembly is a process that operates over a vast range of length and time scales. Microfluidic technology has been proven to be a powerful tool to manipulate micro- and nano-scale substrates with precise control over size and speed using various fluidic materials and properties. In this review, we discuss the current status of microfluidic technology in manipulating fluid dynamics and interfacial phenomena which influence self-assembly process and resulted structures. The self-assembled materials/structures were summarized and discussed as the sequence of the objective size at the micro-, nano- and molecular scale. Overall, microfluidics is becoming a useful tool to manipulate various fluids regarding to physical and chemical properties, being inherently suitable for self-assembly process control.},

The ability to fabricate complex microfluidic architectures has allowed scientists to create new experimental formats for processing ultra-small analytical volumes in short periods and with high efficiency. The development of such microfluidic systems has been driven by a range of fundamental features that accompany miniaturization. These include the ability to handle small sample volumes, ultra-low fabrication costs, reduced analysis times, enhanced operational flexibility, facile automation, and the ability to integrate functional components within complex analytical schemes. Herein we discuss the impact of microfluidics in the area of high-throughput screening and drug discovery and highlight some of the most pertinent studies in the recent literature.},

  abstract = {Most electroanalytical techniques require the precise control of the potentials in an electrochemical cell using a potentiostat. Commercial potentiostats function as ``black boxes,'' giving limited information about their circuitry and behaviour which can make development of new measurement techniques and integration with other instruments challenging. Recently, a number of lab-built potentiostats have emerged with various design goals including low manufacturing cost and field-portability, but notably lacking is an accessible potentiostat designed for general lab use, focusing on measurement quality combined with ease of use and versatility. To fill this gap, we introduce DStat (http://microfluidics.utoronto.ca/dstat), an open-source, general-purpose potentiostat for use alone or integrated with other instruments. DStat offers picoampere current measurement capabilities, a compact USB-powered design, and user-friendly cross-platform software. DStat is easy and inexpensive to build, may be modified freely, and achieves good performance at low current levels not accessible to other lab-built instruments. In head-to-head tests, DStat's voltammetric measurements are much more sensitive than those of ``CheapStat'' (a popular open-source potentiostat described previously), and are comparable to those of a compact commercial ``black box'' potentiostat. Likewise, in head-to-head tests, DStat's potentiometric precision is similar to that of a commercial pH meter. Most importantly, the versatility of DStat was demonstrated through integration with the open-source DropBot digital microfluidics platform. In sum, we propose that DStat is a valuable contribution to the ``open source'' movement in analytical science, which is allowing users to adapt their tools to their experiments rather than alter their experiments to be compatible with their tools.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidics (DMF) is an emerging technique for manipulating small volumes of liquids. DMF is particularly well suited for analytical applications as it allows automated handling of discrete samples, and it has been integrated with several inline analysis techniques. However, examples of the integration of DMF with electroanalytical methods are notably scarce, and those that have been reported rely on external electrodes that impose limitations on complexity. To combine the full capabilities of DMF with voltammetry, we designed a platform featuring a three-electrode electrochemical cell integrated in a microfabricated DMF device, removing the need for external electrodes and allowing for complete droplet control. The performance of the DMF/voltammetry system is comparable to that of a commercial screen printed electrode, and the new platform was applied to generating a calibration series for acetaminophen with a limit of detection of 76 {$\mu$}M and good precision (4\% average RSD), all with minimal human intervention. We propose that this platform and variations thereof may be a useful new tool for microscale electroanalysis and will be a complementary system to existing inline analysis techniques for DMF.},

  abstract = {Salmonella is a pathogenic bacterium capable of causing serious food-borne illness, which has caused worldwide concern. It can enter the food supply chain at various stages of production, distribution, and marketing. Due to its high prevalence, it is necessary to develop effective and efficient methods for the identification, detection, and monitoring of Salmonella at an early stage. While traditional detection technologies often have long detection times, complex operation and low sensitivity, emerging biosensor technologies combine novel nanomaterials with signal amplification methods to achieve improved performance. Biosensors show several advantages over traditional assays in terms of specificity, accuracy, and sensitivity and show superiority in rapid response. They are now seen as promising alternative tools since they are accessible and applicable approaches for rapid detection. In recent years, there has been a boom in the development of biosensors for the detection of foodborne Salmonella. This paper focuses on the comparison of new methods for the detection of optical and electrochemical biosensors in recent years, analyzes the different separation strategies and determination methods used, and provides an outlook on the future development of biosensors for the detection of Salmonella.},

This paper presents the design and development of a standalone, point-ofsource, portable, low-cost, automated and integrated microfluidic system for quick detection and quantification of nitrite. Based on multiphysics simulations, a disposable polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic device was employed to carry out the controlled Griess reaction based assay. A low-cost 3D printed syringe pump was developed to inject the sample and reagent. Photometric detection was employed using light emitting diode (LED) and photodiode. A transimpedance amplifier circuit was designed and fabricated to achieve amplified photodiode output with reduced noise. An off-the-shelf microprocessor was used to integrate the whole system and a smartphone application (app) was developed to control the complete system and store the data. Interaction between the application and the microprocessor was achieved using Bluetooth connectivity. Spectrophotometric validation was performed and a calibration equation was obtained which was used to convert the device voltage output to absorption, through specially programmed android app. All the components were integrated in a 3D printed platform whose virtues such as ease of usage and affordability makes, quantification of nitrite, a simple and real time process wherein the limit of detection and limit of quantification values are found to be 0.07103 ppm and 0.21524 ppm respectively with good repeatability.},

Soil health is determined by quantifying nutrients and physical parameters that are required to be in optimum range depending on the cropping pattern. In line with this, the current work presents an integrated, low-cost, microfluidic-based system for the detection of three such parameters namely -- nitrite, pH and electrical conductivity (EC). A filtration protocol using different grades of Whatman filter paper was established to detect the said parameters using a suspension of soil. A multiplexed polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) device was designed and fabricated to test for EC and nitrite. The device employed a conductivity cell with copper electrodes, connected in series with a resistor, powered using an oscillating power source. Griess reaction-based photometric detection using an LED and photodiode was used to quantify nitrite. A transimpedance amplifier circuit was designed and fabricated to amplify the photodiode output. pH detection was achieved using a commercially available pH probe and an Arduino pH breakout board. A low-cost 3D printed syringe pump was developed to achieve flow control. Atmega 328P (onboard Arduino Uno) was used to integrate the subsystems. A smartphone application was built to control the system and store geotagged data. Bluetooth protocol was used to communicate between the smartphone application and Arduino. Standards and real soil samples were tested using the developed microfluidic system.},

  abstract = {This paper reports on single step and rapid fabrication of interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) using an inkjet printing-based approach. A commercial inkjet-printed circuit board (PCB) printer was used to fabricate the IDEs on a glass substrate. The inkjet printer was optimized for printing IDEs on a glass substrate using a carbon ink with a specified viscosity. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in the frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz was employed for chemical sensing applications using an electrochemical workstation. The IDE sensors demonstrated good nitrite quantification abilities, detecting a low concentration of 1 ppm. Taste simulating chemicals were used to experimentally analyze the ability of the developed sensor to detect and quantify tastes as perceived by humans. The performance of the inkjet-printed IDE sensor was compared with that of the IDEs fabricated using maskless direct laser writing (DLW)-based photolithography. The DLW--photolithography-based fabrication approach produces IDE sensors with excellent geometric tolerances and better sensing performance. However, inkjet printing provides IDE sensors at a fraction of the cost and time. The inkjet printing-based IDE sensor, fabricated in under 2 min and costing less than USD 0.3, can be adapted as a suitable IDE sensor with rapid and scalable fabrication process capabilities.},

In our paper, SAW microfluidic applications are categorized into droplet-based applications and continuous-flow applications. Droplet is actuated into unique behaviours depending on the applied SAW power. A wide range of droplet based applications have been employed utilizing these behaviours. In continuous-flow system, applications are further categorized based on the interaction of travelling SAW and standing SAW with the bulk liquid.

Herein, we developed an effective pretreatment method based on in situ enrichment culture with an immunomagnetic separation step, combined with droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) technology to achieve rapid detection of trace Salmonella in milk, which allowed detecting as low as 10 1 CFU/mL level of Salmonella. It took 8 h to perform the entire testing process from pretreatment to ddPCR detection and analysis.

  abstract = {Microfluidics-based lab-on-chip (LOC) systems are an active research area that is revolutionising high-throughput sequencing for the fast, sensitive and accurate detection of a variety of pathogens. LOCs also serve as portable diagnostic tools. The devices provide optimum control of nanolitre volumes of fluids and integrate various bioassay operations that allow the devices to rapidly sense pathogenic threat agents for environmental monitoring. LOC systems, such as microfluidic biochips, offer advantages compared to conventional identification procedures that are tedious, expensive and time consuming. This paper aims to provide a broad overview of the need for devices that are easy to operate, sensitive, fast, portable and sufficiently reliable to be used as complementary tools for the control of pathogenic agents that damage the environment.},

  abstract = {In the context of an integrated Lab-on-PCB wearable patch extracting interstitial fluid from the patient via integrated microneedles, the requirements from the integrated biosensing part are quite special compared to static glucose electrochemical biosensors. Hence, in this study, a fully PCB-integrated enzymatic glucose quantification Lab-on-Chip device is presented and evaluated considering these special requirements for such a patch implementation: a) range and limit of detection compatible with interstitial fluid glucose levels of diabetic patients and b) effect of sample flow rate on the biosensing platform performance. This work employs a chronoamperometric approach for glucose detection based on covalently immobilized glucose oxidase on PCB-integrated electrodes. The chronoamperometric measurements show that this platform exhibits {$\mu$}M range sensitivity, high specificity, and good reproducibility, and the assay can detect glucose from 10 {$\mu$}M to 9 mM with a lower limit of detection of 10 {$\mu$}M. The demonstrated detection range under continuous flow proved compatible with interstitial fluid glucose levels of diabetic patients. The sample-to-answer time of our Lab-on-PCB device is less than 1 min (sample delivery of few seconds and 20 s for electrochemical measurement), employing sample volumes of 50 {$\mu$}L in this instance. Increased flow rates substantially improve the platform sensitivity (1.1 {$\mu$}A/mM @0 {$\mu$}L/min to 6.2 {$\mu$}A/mM @10 {$\mu$}L/min), with the measured current increasing exponentially to the flow rate, as opposed to the theoretically expected much lower dependence. This work demonstrates the feasibility of Lab-on-PCB patches in terms of biosensing performance, paving the way for the first cost-effective, painless diabetes management microsystem.},

  abstract = {Background: Excessive collection of platelets is an unwanted side effect in current centrifugation-based peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) apheresis. We investigated a novel microchip-based acoustophoresis technique, utilizing ultrasonic standing wave forces for the removal of platelets from PBPC products. By applying an acoustic standing wave field onto a continuously flowing cell suspension in a micro channel, cells can be separated from the surrounding media depending on their physical properties. StudyDesignandMethods:PBPC samples were obtained from patients (n = 15) and healthy donors (n = 6) and sorted on an acoustophoresis-chip. The acoustic force was set to separate leukocytes from platelets into a target fraction and a waste fraction, respectively. The PBPC samples, the target and the waste fractions were analysed for cell recovery, purity and functionality. Results: The median separation efficiency of leukocytes to the target fraction was 98\% whereas platelets were effectively depleted by 89\%. PBPC samples and corresponding target fractions were similar in the percentage of CD34+ hematopoetic progenitor/stem cells as well as leukocyte/lymphocyte subset distributions. Median viability was 98\%, 98\% and 97\% in the PBPC samples, the target and the waste fractions, respectively. Results from hematopoietic progenitor cell assays indicated a preserved colony-forming ability post-sorting. Evaluation of platelet activation by P-selectin (CD62P) expression revealed a significant increase of CD62P+ platelets in the target (19\%) and waste fractions (20\%), respectively, compared to the PBPC input samples (9\%). However, activation was lower when compared to stored blood bank platelet concentrates (48\%). Conclusion: Acoustophoresis can be utilized to efficiently deplete PBPC samples of platelets, whilst preserving the target stem/progenitor cell and leukocyte cell populations, cell viability and progenitor cell colony-forming ability. Acoustophoresis is, thus, an interesting technology to improve current cell processing methods.},

  abstract = {Microfluidics is an emerging technology for manipulating small amounts of fluids for analytic purposes. Microfluidic devices, so-called Labs-on-Chip (LoC), have found widespread applications in medicine, biology, and chemistry. In contrast to other fields, verification and design automation methods for microfluidic chips are not yet as developed due to a lack of common standards. However, recently, there have been new developments with the introduction of the ISO 22916:2022 standard, which contains specifications for microfluidic components and interfaces. In this work, we propose a methodology that, for the first time, enables automatic validation of microfluidic chip designs against place and route constraints in the context of this ISO standard. To this end, we utilize solvers for Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). The resulting approach does not only validate the ISO-compliance of a given design but also provides tool support for the completion of the design. The applicability and feasibility of the proposed solution are demonstrated in a case study inspired by real-world use cases. An open-source implementation of the resulting tool is available at https://github.com/cda-tum/mmft-iso-designer.},

  abstract = {Microfluidics is an emerging technology that is expected to revolutionize biochemical experiments and reduce the need for unwieldy laboratory equipment. Motivated by that, the design automation community has spent considerable efforts and proposed numerous methods on automating the design process for corresponding microfluidic devices. For many of them, however, it often remains unclear whether the (automatically) generated design indeed works as intended and/or satisfies its purpose. Simulations, e.g., based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can help here as they allow for studying the behavior of microfluidic devices without the need for actual fabrication. However, the setup and configuration of CFD simulations is timeconsuming and requires extensive expertise---some of the reasons why it is hardly utilized in the design automation community yet. In this work, we propose a workflow that improves upon this state of the art by automating intermediate steps and highlighting the parameters that are relevant to the specific use case. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed workflow for fluid mixing in channel-based microfluidics.},

Despite the significant progress in their development over the last few years and their applications in various classic and emerging fields, the control of their shape and size remains a challenge, in particular the search for more efficient and environmentally friendly syntheses. In this context, the microfluidics approach allows not only the continuous production of MOFs but also an accurate reaction parameter control in their synthesis, representing a step towards intensification, versatility and scalability in the use of MOFs. Microfluidics also offers the possibility of synthesizing effective and defect free MOF-based hollow fiber membranes saving reactants as compared to conventional methods. This review is devoted to highlighting the multitude of synergies appearing when dealing with MOFs and microfluidics, not only in the bare synthesis of MOFs and their hierarchical structures but also when fabricating hollow fiber membranes with important applications in the separation field.},

  abstract = {Acoustophoresis has become a powerful tool to separate microparticles and cells, based on their material and biophysical properties, and is gaining popularity in clinical and biomedical research. One major application of acoustophoresis is to measure the compressibility of cells and small organisms, which is related to their contents. The cell compressibility can be extracted from the acoustic mobility, which is the main output of acoustic migration experiments, if the material properties and sizes of reference particles, the size of the cells, and the surrounding medium are known. Accurate methods to measure and calibrate the acoustic energy density in acoustophoresis systems are therefore critical. In this Perspective, polystyrene microparticles have become the most commonly used reference particles in acoustophoresis, due to their similar biophysical properties to cells. We utilized a two-step focusing method to measure the relative acoustic mobility of polystyrene beads of various sizes and colors and present a quantitative analysis of the variation in acousto-mechanical properties of polystyrene microparticles, showing a large spread in their material properties. A variation of more than 25\% between different particle types was found. Thus, care is required when relying on polystyrene particles as a reference when characterizing acoustofluidics systems or acousto-mechanical properties of cells.},

  abstract = {Detection of the presence, size and speed of microdroplets in microfluidic devices is presented using commercially available capacitive sensors which make the droplet based microfluidic systems scalable and inexpensive. Cross-contamination between the droplets is eliminated by introducing a passivation layer between the sensing electrodes and droplets. A simple T-junction generator is used to generate droplets in microchannels. Coplanar electrodes are used to form a capacitance through the microfluidic channel. The change in capacitance due to the presence of a droplet in the sensing area is detected and used to determine the size and speed of the droplet. The design of a single pair of electrodes is used to detect the presence of a droplet and the interdigital finger design is used to detect the size and speed of the droplet. An analytical model is developed to predict the detection signal and guide the experimental optimization of the sensor geometry. The measured droplet information is displayed through a Labview interface in real-time. The use of capacitance sensors to monitor droplet sorting at a T-junction is also presented. The discussions in this paper can be generalized to any droplet detection application and can serve as a guideline in sensor selection.},

  abstract = {A digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) is an attractive technology platform for various biomedical applications. However, a conventional DMFB is limited by: (i) the number of electrical connections that can be practically realized, (ii) constraints on droplet size and volume, and (iii) the need for special fabrication processes and the associated reliability/yield concerns. To overcome the above challenges, DMFBs based on a micro-electrode-dot-array (MEDA) architecture have been proposed and fabricated recently. Error recovery is of key interest for MEDA biochips due to the need for system reliability. Errors are likely to occur during droplet manipulation due to defects, chip degradation, and the uncertainty inherent in biochemical experiments. In this paper, we first formalize error-recovery objectives, and then synthesize optimal error-recovery protocols using a model based on Stochastic Multiplayer Games (SMGs). We also present a global error-recovery technique that can update the schedule of fluidic operations in an adaptive manner. Using three representative real-life bioassays, we show that the proposed approach can effectively reduce the bioassay completion time and increase the probability of success for error recovery.},

  abstract = {We report an in-depth study of the long-term reproducibility and reliability of droplet dispensing in digital microfluidic devices (DMF). This involved dispensing droplets from a reservoir, measuring the volume of both the droplet and the reservoir droplet and then returning the daughter droplet to the original reservoir. The repetition of this process over the course of several hundred iterations offers, for the first time, a long-term view of droplet dispensing in DMF devices. Results indicate that the ratio between the spacer thickness and the electrode size influences the reliability of droplet dispensing. In addition, when the separation between the plates is large, the volume of the reservoir greatly affects the reproducibility in the volume of the dispensed droplets, creating ``reliability regimes.'' We conclude that droplet dispensing exhibits superior reliability as inter-plate device spacing is decreased, and the daughter droplet volume is most consistent when the reservoir volume matches that of the reservoir electrode.},

  abstract = {When making a droplet flow device what material should you use? What fabrication methods are available and will surface treatments be required? This review offers a guide, with examples, to making robust droplet flow devices.           ,              Since the first reports two decades ago, droplet-based systems have emerged as a compelling tool for microbiological and (bio)chemical science, with droplet flow providing multiple advantages over standard single-phase microfluidics such as removal of Taylor dispersion, enhanced mixing, isolation of droplet contents from surfaces, and the ability to contain and address individual cells or biomolecules. Typically, a droplet microfluidic device is designed to produce droplets with well-defined sizes and compositions that flow through the device without interacting with channel walls. Successful droplet flow is fundamentally dependent on the microfluidic device -- not only its geometry but moreover how the channel surfaces interact with the fluids. Here we summarise the materials and fabrication techniques required to make microfluidic devices that deliver controlled uniform droplet flow, looking not just at physical fabrication methods, but moreover how to select and modify surfaces to yield the required surface/fluid interactions. We describe the various materials, surface modification techniques, and channel geometry approaches that can be used, and give examples of the decision process when determining which material or method to use by describing the design process for five different devices with applications ranging from field-deployable chemical analysers to water-in-water droplet creation. Finally we consider how droplet microfluidic device fabrication is changing and will change in the future, and what challenges remain to be addressed in the field.},

A PCB based sensor integration method is presented that enables rapid prototyping of lab-on-PCB devices for gas analysis.           ,              Rapid prototyping of microfluidic devices requires low cost materials and simple fabrication methods. PMMA and PCB have been used separately for the fabrication of microfluidic devices in a wide range of applications. Although the combined use of PMMA and PCB can have considerable merits, few works have been reported on the direct bonding of these materials. In this work we have investigated the fabrication of microfluidic devices using PMMA and PCB for the analysis of gaseous samples. In order to yield a reliable direct bonding method, four parameters including temperature, pressure, solvent and patterned interface material were experimentally investigated. Results of testing various prototypes showed that a patterned interface of concentric rectangular copper rings exposed to solvent at room temperature and under moderate pressure provided better adhesion strength, sealing and durability. After successful development of the PMMA-PCB direct bonding process, sample prototypes were designed and fabricated to practically assess the combined advantages of two materials. Presented concepts include implementation of heater on a PCB, array of gas sensors coupled with microchannels, serpentine microchannel and fast evaporation of liquid sample using an SMD resistor. It has been shown that advantages of utilizing PMMA such as fabricating the channel easily and with low cost, can be combined with benefits of a PCB including simple sensor installation and the use of copper tracks and electronic components for gas flow modulation. Moreover, it is possible to implement channel, circuit and other electronic components such as microprocessors on a single device.},

  abstract = {A high degree of beam steering is demonstrated using an electrowetting-driven liquid prism. While prism devices have typically relied on complex and expensive laboratory setups, such as high-vacuum facilities for fabrication of dielectric layers, this work utilizes a simple dip-coating method to provide an ion gel layer as a dielectric, offering 2 or 3 orders higher specific capacitance (c {$\approx$} 10\,{$\mu$}F/cm2) than that of conventional dielectrics. Analytical studies present the effects of liquid selection and arrangement on overall prism performance. For experimental demonstrations of high-performance beam steering, we not only selected two immiscible liquids of water and 1-bromonaphthalene (1-BN) oil which provide the large refractive index difference (nwater\,=\,1.33 and n1-BN\,=\,1.65 at {$\lambda$}\,=\,532\,nm) between them, but also utilized a double-stacked prism configuration which increases the number of interfaces for incoming light to be steered. At a prism apex angle of {$\varphi$}\,=\,27{$^\circ$}, we were able to achieve significantly large beam steering of up to {$\beta$}\,=\,19.06{$^\circ$}, which is the highest beam steering performance ever demonstrated using electrowetting technology.},

We developed a closed-form solution for the inverse problem of the thin-film evolution equation, allowing us to obtain the projection pattern required in order to achieve a desired topography. We experimentally implement the method using a computer controlled light projector, which illuminates any desired pattern onto the bottom of a fluidic chamber patterned with heat--absorbing metal pads. The resulting heat map induces surface tension gradients in the liquid--air interface, giving rise to thermocapillary flow that deforms the liquid surface. If a polymer is used for the liquid film, it can then be photocured to yield a solid device. Based on the inverse-problem solutions and using this system, we demonstrate the fabrication of several diffractive optical elements, including phase masks for extended depth of field imaging, and for three-dimensional localization microscopy. The entire process, from projection to solidification, is completed in less than five minutes, and yields a sub-nanometric surface quality without any post-processing.},

  abstract = {An ideal on-site chemical/biochemical analysis system must be inexpensive, sensitive, fully automated and integrated, reliable, and compatible with a broad range of samples. The advent of digital microfluidic lab-on-a-chip (LoC) technology offers such a detection system due to the advantages in portability, reduction of the volumes of the sample and reagents, faster analysis times, increased automation, low power consumption, compatibility with mass manufacturing, and high throughput. We describe progress towards integrating sample collection onto a digital microfluidic LoC that is a component of a cascade impactor device. The sample collection is performed by impacting airborne particles directly onto the surface ofthe chip. After the collection phase, the surface ofthe chip is washed with a micro-droplet of solvent. The droplet will be digitally directed across the impaction surface, dissolving sample constituents. Because ofthe very small droplet volume used for extraction ofthe sample from a wide collection area, the resulting solution is relatively concentrated and the analytes can be detected after a very short sampling time (1 mm) due to such pre-concentration. After the washing phase, the droplet is mixed with specific reagents that produce colored reaction products. The concentration of the analyte is quantitatively determined by measuring absorption at target wavelengths using a simple light emitting diode and photodiode setup. Specific applications include automatic measurements of major inorganic ions in aerosols, such as sulfate, nitrate and ammonium, with a time resolution of 1 mm and a detection limit of 30 ng/m3. We have already demonstrated the detection and quantification of nitroaromatic explosives without integrating the sample collection. Other applications being developed include airborne bioagent detection.},

In our presented method, bubbles are placed between parallel plates in an oil medium of a low vapor pressure, which eliminates the possibility of changing the gaseous composition of the bubble caused by evaporation of the medium. DEP has been previously investigated to actuate dielectric droplets and is adopted here to drive the oil environment as well as the immersed bubbles between parallel plates. In our experiment, air bubbles of 0.3 l were successfully transported in a 20 cSt silicone oil medium between a 75 m-high parallel plate gap. In addition, 0.6 l air bubbles were successfully split into two 0.3 l air bubbles, and then merged again by DEP. These successful manipulations make digital gaseous lab-on-a-chip a reality.},

  abstract = {On-chip digital microfluidic flowmetry can be designed and incorporated into standard microfluidic devices for high-precision multiplexed microflow measurements.           ,                             The accurate monitoring and control of liquid flow at low flow rates have become increasingly important in contemporary biomedical research and industrial monitoring. Inspired by the drop-counting principle implemented in a clinical gravity drip, we propose a novel microfluidic flowmetry technology for polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based conventional microfluidic devices, known as a microfluidic digital meter-on-chip (DMC), to achieve on-chip and localized microflow measurements with ultrahigh precision and a wide tunable range. The DMC technology primarily relies on capillarity, unlike a gravity drip, to induce a characteristic interfacial droplet pinch-off process, from which digital microflowmetry devices can discretize continuous flow into countable transferred liquid units with consistent quantifiable volumes. Enabled by the passive discretization principle and optical transparency, the DMC device requires no external energy input or bulky control equipment, and a non-contact wireless optical detection scheme using a smartphone can be conveniently used as a readout module. Moreover, the DMC technology achieves an ultrahigh flow-to-frequency sensitivity (6.59 Hz ({$\mu$}L min               -1               )               -1               ) and resolution (droplet transfer volume down to 2.5 nL, nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than in previously reported work, resulting in ultralow flow rates of 1 {$\mu$}L min               -1               ). In addition, the flow rate measurement range covers up to 80 {$\mu$}L min               -1               and down to at least 150 nL min               -1               (over 100 times lower than reported similar digital flowmetry on the same time scale) using the current device configuration. Benefiting from its simple device architecture and adaptability, the versatile DMC technology can be seamlessly integrated with various microfluidic and nanofluidic devices for drug delivery and biochemical analysis, serving as a promising technology platform for next-generation highly demanding microflow measurements.},

  abstract = {Flow-electrode capacitive deionization (FCDI) technology has been demonstrated to be a promising approach for ammonia removal and recovery. The flow-electrode, where adsorption and desorption occur, is one of the most significant parts in FCDI cells. However, in previous studies, the influence of concentrations in the electrolyte was not well understood, which greatly influenced system performances. In this study, we initially evaluated FCDI performance by using electrolytes containing different amounts of activated carbon (AC), as well as initial ammonium concentrations. Results indicated that compared to concentration factors (CFs), the effect of AC contents on the deionization process was almost neglectable. To achieve efficient ammonia removal and enrichment, initial CF below 10 and refreshment of flow-electrode when CF exceeded 100 were recommended. Further experiments indicated that the poor system performance under high initial CF was caused by concentration polarization and ion back diffusion. The long-term experiment confirmed the above conclusion. Besides, a high concentration of 5600 mg{$\cdot$}L-1 was gained for ammonia recovery. This study demonstrated that the concentration in the electrolyte needs to be considered carefully to maintain the system in an efficient and economic state.},

Various analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction patterns, scanning electron micrograph, transmission electron microscope, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, UV--Vis absorption spectra and Fourier transform infrared spectra were used to determine the structure, composition and morphology of the as-prepared samples. It can be concluded that MnTMPyP cations were inserted into interlayer spacing of the [NbWO6]- nanosheets and arranged in an inclined single layer at 58{$^\circ$}. The MnTMPyP/NbWO6 nanocomposites modified electrode exhibited excellent electro-catalytic oxidation activity toward nitrite in 0.2 mol L-1 and pH 7.0 phosphate buffer solution. Additionally, the oxidation peak current is proportional to the square root of scan rates, indicating that the redox reaction of nitrite is a typical diffusion-controlled process. Also, the sensitivity and detection limit for nitrite at the modified electrode was evaluated as 3.80 9 10-5 mol L-1 over a concentration range from 1.20 9 10-4 to 3.57 9 10-3 mol L-1 by using differential pulse voltammetry.},

  abstract = {Bioparticles such as mammalian cells and bacteria can be manipulated directly or indirectly for multiple applications such as sample preparation for diagnostic applications mainly upconcentration, enrichment \& separation as well as immunoassay development. There are various active and passive microfluidic particle manipulation techniques where Acoustophoresis is a powerful technique showing high cell viability. The use of disposable glass capillaries for acoustophoresis, instead of cleanroom fabricated glass-silicon chip can potentially bring down the cost factor substantially, aiding the realization of this technique for real-world diagnostic devices. Unlike available chips and capillary-based microfluidic devices, we report milliliter-scale platform able to accommodate 1ml of a sample for acoustophoresis based processing on a market available glass capillary. Although it is presented as a generic platform but as a demonstration we have shown that polystyrene suspending medium sample can be processed with trapping efficiency of 87\% and the up-concentration factor of 10 times in a flow through manner i.e., at 35{\textmu}l/min. For stationary volume accommodation, this platform practically offers 50 times more sample handling capacity than most of the microfluidic setups. Furthermore, we have also shown that with diluted blood (0.6\%) in a flow-through manner, 82\% of the white blood cells (WBCs) per ml could be kept trapped. This milliliter platform could potentially be utilized for assisting in sample preparation, plasma separation as well as a flow-through immunoassay assay development for clinical diagnostic applications.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the demonstration of on-chip fabrication of a potassium-selective sensor array enabled by electrowetting on dielectric digital microfluidics for the first time. This demonstration proves the concept that electrochemical sensors can be seamlessly integrated with sample preparation units in a digital microfluidic platform. More significantly, the successful on-chip fabrication of a sensor array indicates that sensors become reconfigurable and have longer lifetime in a digital microfluidic platform. The on-chip fabrication of ion-selective electrodes includes electroplating Ag followed by forming AgCl layer by chemical oxidation and depositing a thin layer of desired polymer-based ion selective membrane on one of the sensor electrodes. In this study, potassium ionophores work as potassium ion channels and make the membrane selective to potassium ions. This selectiveness results in the voltage difference across the membrane layer, which is correlated with potassium ion concentration. The calibration curve of the fabricated potassium-selective electrode demonstrates the slope of 58 mV/dec for potassium concentration in KCl sample solutions and shows good agreement with the ideal Nernstian response. The proposed sensor platform is an outstanding candidate for a portable home-use for continuous monitoring of ions thanks to its advantages such as easy automation of sample preparation and detection processes, elongated sensor lifetime, minimal membrane and sample consumption, and user-definable/ reconfigurable sensor array.},

The device runs an axisymmetric drop shape analysis (ADSA) algorithm written in Python. The code, here named DropToolKit, was developed in-house. We initially present the mathematical framework of our algorithm and then we validate our software tool against other well-established ADSA packages, including the commercial ram{\'e}-hart DROPimage Advanced as well as the DropAnalysis plugin in ImageJ.

They are usually used as single-rod measuring chains in different designs, which are manufactured using precision mechanical manufacturing and assembling technologies. The paper describes a microsystem technology approach for the fabrication of miniaturized electrochemical sensors. The ceramic HTCC (high-temperature co-fired ceramic) and LTCC (low-temperature co-fired ceramic) multilayer technology enables suitable processes for the manufacturing of robust and miniaturized sensor arrays with a high functional density. Design, manufacture, and electrochemical performance of the novel ceramic multilayer-based sensor array are presented in the paper using various examples. An adapted material and process development was carried out for the sensitive functional films. Special thick-film pastes for the detection of the pH value as well as NH4+, K+, Ca2+, and Cu2+ ion concentrations in aqueous solutions were developed. Ion-sensitive thick-film membranes were deposited on a ceramic multilayer sensor platform by means of screen-printing. All ISEs, integrated in the sensor array, showed suitable electrochemical performances including a very quick response (several seconds) combined with a high sensitivity (exhibiting Nernstian behaviour) in the tested measuring range. The obtained sensitivities were around 57\,mVper\>decade: for the pH sensor, 30\,mVper\>decade for calcium, 53\,mVper\>decade for potassium, and 57\,mVper\>decade for ammonium. Depending on the application, different sensitive electrodes on the ceramic sensor array can be combined as required.},

Additional components (such as heaters, centrifuges, mixers, etc.) are required in practical applications on DMF devices. In this paper, a DMF chip interconnection method based on electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) was proposed. An open modified slippery liquid-infused porous surface (SLIPS) membrane was used as the dielectric-hydrophobic layer material, which consisted of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane and silicone oil. Indium tin oxide (ITO) glass was used to manufacture the DMF chip. In order to test the relationship between the splicing gap and droplet moving, the effect of the different electrodes on/off time on the minimum driving voltage when the droplet crossed a splicing gap was investigated. Then, the effects of splicing gaps of different widths, splicing heights, and electrode misalignments were investigated, respectively. The experimental results showed that a driving voltage of 119 V was required for a droplet to cross a splicing gap width of 300 {\textmu}m when the droplet volume was 10 {\textmu}L and the electrode on/off time was 600 ms. At the same time, the droplet could climb a height difference of 150 {\textmu}m with 145 V, and 141 V was required when the electrode misalignment was 1000 {\textmu}m. Finally, the minimum voltage was not obviously changed, when the same volume droplet with different aqueous solutions crossed the splicing gap, and the droplet could cross different chip types. These splicing solutions show high potential for simultaneous detection of multiple components in human body fluids.},

Such characterization can be performed through the use of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), which is a powerful noninvasive physical methodology for determining electrochemical and topographic characteristics of complex samples. Depth scan SECM imaging was performed for the generation of 2D current maps of an IDAE relative to an ultramicroelectrode (UME) position in the x-z plane. Hundreds of probe approach curves (PACs) and horizontal sweeps were obtained from one depth scan image by simply extracting vertical and horizontal cross-sectional lines. These experimental PACs and sweeps were further characterized through comparison with simulation generated curves through modeling of the experimental system. An UME approach to and horizontal sweep across asymmetric systems such as an IDAE were explored in this paper. Full 3D models of finite element analysis were developed for the above SECM system, providing a deeper understanding of the above PACs and horizontal sweeps by means of SECM feedback in correlation with local concentration profiles. Especially, the transition region of an IDAE, where conductive and insulating substrates meet, was extensively investigated in this work.},

  abstract = {Stricter environmental controls on the emission and discharge of chemical pollutants are creating an increased demand for the development of improved chemical sensor devices. Although electrochemical sensors show great promise for this task, their utility has been constrained by a number of practical problems, the most serious being the effect of surface adsorption of impurities leading to non-reproducible response. This review presents a survey of recent advances in electrochemical sensor technology which have attempted to improve the performance of these devices. Three main areas of development have been addressed, advances in sensor design and measurement techniques, novel approaches to conferring electrode selectivity and the use of microminiaturization and rnicroeleotronics fabrication techniques. Recent applications and future prospects for the measurement of toxic metals, organics and gases including volatile organic compounds are surveyed.},

The system is composed of a microfluidic platform, which is inserted into an electronic device. The microfluidic platform implements the transport of fluids, meanwhile the electronic module is on charge of the activation, heating and the interface with the user. The impulsion is based on the combination between pressurized chambers and the valves that control the pass of fluid. In particular, in this paper, an example of application of the lab protocol is reported. The experiments show the behaviour of the whole system under the required specifications. The proposed system is versatile and can be reconfigured for different applications. This system means a contribution towards the integration of protocols of laboratory on portable platforms.},

For the study of static problems that can be written in terms of minimization of an energy, a boundary integral method for the computation of charge density distributions is developed. We illustrate its use with the computation of static shapes of charged drops over a flat surface and under the influence of an external potential. For the study of dynamic problems, where drops can move over a solid substrate we develop a phase-field model. Such models replace the sharp interfaces between two fluids by a so-called diffuse interface. We illustrate the use of the phase-field model with the calculation of drops spreading and moving in an electrowetting system.},

We present a unique acoustophoretic concept for the contactless transport and handling of matter in air. Spatiotemporal modulation of the levitation acoustic field allows continuous planar transport and processing of multiple objects, from near-spherical (volume of 0.1--10 {$\mu$}L) to wire-like, without being limited by the acoustic wavelength. The independence of the handling principle from special material properties (magnetic, optical, or electrical) is illustrated with a wide palette of application experiments, such as contactless droplet coalescence and mixing, solid--liquid encapsulation, absorption, dissolution, and DNA transfection. More than a century after the pioneering work of Lord Rayleigh on acoustic radiation pressure, a path-breaking concept is proposed to harvest the significant benefits of acoustic levitation in air.},

However, common approaches, such as inkjet or electrohydrodynamic printing, are well suited only for materials with low viscosity or specific electromagnetic properties, respectively. While in-air acoustophoretic forces are material-independent, they are typically weak and have yet to be harnessed for printing materials. We introduce an acoustophoretic printing method that enables drop-on-demand patterning of a broad range of soft materials, including Newtonian fluids, whose viscosities span more than four orders of magnitude (0.5 to 25,000 mPa{$\cdot$}s) and yield stress fluids ({$\tau$}               0               {$>$} 50 Pa). By exploiting the acoustic properties of a subwavelength Fabry-Perot resonator, we have generated an accurate, highly localized acoustophoretic force that can exceed the gravitational force by two orders of magnitude to eject microliter-to-nanoliter volume droplets. The versatility of acoustophoretic printing is demonstrated by patterning food, optical resins, liquid metals, and cell-laden biological matrices in desired motifs.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to study resonance conditions for acoustic particle focusing inside droplets in two-phase microfluidic systems. A bulk acoustic wave microfluidic chip was designed and fabricated for focusing microparticles inside aqueous droplets (plugs) surrounded by a continuous oil phase in a 380-{$\mu$}m-wide channel. The quality of the acoustic particle focusing was investigated by considering the influence of the acoustic properties of the continuous phase in relation to the dispersed phase. To simulate the system and study the acoustic radiation force on the particles inside droplets, a simplified 3D model was used. The resonance conditions and focusing quality were studied for two different cases: (1) the dispersed and continuous phases were acoustically mismatched (water droplets in fluorinated oil) and (2) the dispersed and continuous phases were acoustically matched (water droplets in olive oil). Experimentally, we observed poor acoustic particle focusing inside droplets surrounded by fluorinated oil while good focusing was observed in droplets surrounded by olive oil. The experimental results are supported qualitatively by our simulations. These show that the acoustic properties (density and compressibility) of the dispersed and continuous phases must be matched to generate a strong and homogeneous acoustic field inside the droplet that is suitable for high-quality intra-droplet acoustic particle focusing.},

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of CMOS capacitive sensors featuring sensing electrodes connected to interface circuits. A capacitive biosensor is also incorporated with microfluidic structure. This paper addresses the challenges of developing high precision interface circuits for detecting small capacitance changes on sensing electrodes. Also, we discuss the practical issues in fabricating hermetic microfluidic packaging structures to direct the samples toward sensing sites and prevent the remaining part of circuitry from direct contact with the sample. By offering the advantages of low complexity and high precision, CMOS capacitive sensor arrays can be considered as an alternative candidate for high throughput screening of cellular and molecular activities.},

Prevention of outbreaks caused by pathogens such as               Legionella pneumophila               would be facilitated by the development of sensitive and specific bioanalytical assays that can be easily integrated in miniaturized fluidic handling systems. In this work, we report on the integration of an amplification-free assay in digital microfluidics (DMF) for the detection of               Legionella               bacteria based on targeting 16s rRNA. We first review the design of the developed DMF devices, which provide the capability to store up to one hundred nL-size droplets simultaneously, and discuss the challenges involved with on-chip integration of the RNA-based assay. By optimizing the various steps of the assay, including magnetic capture, hybridization duration, washing steps, and assay temperature, a limit of detection as low as 1.8 attomoles of synthetic 16s rRNA was obtained, which compares advantageously to other amplification-free detection systems. Finally, we demonstrate the specificity of the developed assay by performing multiplex detection of 16s rRNAs from a pathogenic and a non-pathogenic species of               Legionella               . We believe the developed DMF devices combined with the proposed detection system offers new prospects for the deployment of rapid and cost-effective technologies for on-site monitoring of pathogenic bacteria.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with microfluidic studies for lab-on-a-chip development. The first goal was to develop microsystems immediately usable by biologists for complex protocol integrations. All fluid operations are performed on nano-liter droplet independently handled solely by electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) actuation. A bottom-up architecture was used for chip design due to the development and validation of elementary fluidic designs, which are then assembled. This approach speeds up development and industrialization while minimizing the effort in designing and simplifying chip-fluidic programming. Dispensing reproducibility for 64 nl droplets obtained a CV below 3\% and mixing time was only a few seconds. Ease of the integration was demonstrated by performing on chip serial dilutions of 2.8-folds, four times. The second part of this paper concerns the development of new innovative fluidic functions in order to extend EWOD-actuated digital fluidics' capabilities. Experiments of particle dispensing by EWOD droplet handling are reported. Finally, work is shown concerning the coupling of EWOD actuation and magnetic fields for magnetic bead manipulation.},

For instance, devices that take advantage of rigid (glass, silicon) or soft (elastomer, PDMS) materials, as well as porous materials, such as paper, are widely reported in the literature. In this paper, we illustrate the potentialities of hyper elastic materials for lab-on-chip developments. Two breakthrough examples are reported: (i) a new digital microfluidics approach based on a stretchable membrane for addressing a large range of liquid volumes in complex protocols and (ii) a new low-cost approach for prototyping fully deformable microfluidic devices based on a polymeric foam.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidics, a technique for manipulation of droplets, is becoming increasingly important for the development of miniaturized platforms for laboratory processes. Despite the enthusiasm, droplet motion is frequently hindered by the desorption of proteins or other analytes to surfaces. Current approaches to minimize this unwanted surface fouling involve the addition of extra species to the droplet or its surroundings, which might be problematic depending on the droplet content. Here, a new strategy is introduced to move droplets containing cells and other analytes on solid substrates, without extra moieties; in particular, droplets with bovine serum albumin could be moved at a concentration 2000 times higher than previously reported (without additives). This capability is achieved by using a soot-based superamphiphobic surface combined with a new device geometry, which favors droplet rolling. Contrasting with electrowetting, wetting forces are not required for droplet motion.},

This review addresses the techniques for droplet control, starting with the most common, involving forces of electric origin, followed by other methods currently utilized. A discussion of the basic geometries employed, often utilizing AC voltages, is followed by a section discussing current alternatives to reduce the interaction between droplet and surfaces, frequently associated with device failure. Subsequent sections address the interfacing of DMF with other techniques, and current applications, which include topics like immunoassays, nucleic acids, proteins, cells, and studies of multicellular organisms. In addition, the integration with electromechanical systems and semiconductor structures, with still a modest number of applications, can potentially impact the development of new technologies.},

  abstract = {A direct, sensitive, near-real-time, handheld optical immunoassay device was developed to detect Salmonella typhimurium in the naturally occurring liquid from fresh poultry packages (hereafter ``chicken matrix''), with just single pipetting of sample (i.e., no filtration, culturing and/or isolation, thus reducing the assay time and the error associated with them). Carboxylated, polystyrene microparticles were covalently conjugated with anti-Salmonella, and the immunoagglutination due to the presence of Salmonella was detected by reading the Mie scatter signals from the microfluidic channels using a handheld device. The presence of chicken matrix did not affect the light scatter signal, since the optical parameters (particle size d, wavelength of incident light l and scatter angle y) were optimized to minimize the effect of sample matrix (animal tissues and blood proteins, etc.). The sample was loaded into a microfluidic chip that was split into two channels, one pre-loaded with vacuumdried, antibody-conjugated particles and the other with vacuum-dried, bovine serum albuminconjugated particles. This eliminated the need for a separate negative control, effectively minimizing chip-to-chip and sample-to-sample variations. Particles and the sample were diffused in-channel through chemical agitation by Tween 80, also vacuum-dried within the microchannels. Sequential mixing of the sample to the reagents under a strict laminar flow condition synergistically improved the reproducibility and linearity of the assay. In addition, dried particles were shown to successfully detect lower Salmonella concentrations for up to 8 weeks. The handheld device contains simplified circuitry eliminating unnecessary adjustment stages, providing a stable signal, thus maximizing sensitivity. Total assay time was 10 min, and the detection limit 10 CFU mL 1 was observed in all matrices, demonstrating the suitability of this device for field assays.},

  abstract = {This work develops a technology for actuating droplets of any size without the requirement for high voltages or active control systems, which are typically found in competitive systems. The droplet actuation relies on two microelectrodes separated by a variable gap distance to generate an electrostatic gradient. The physical mechanism for the droplet motion is a combination of liquid dielectrophoresis and electrowetting. Investigating the system behavior as a function of the driving frequency identified the relative contribution of these two mechanisms and the optimum operating conditions. A fixed signal frequency of 0.5 kHz actuated various liquids and contaminants. Droplet actuation was demonstrated on several platforms, including linear, radial-symmetric, and bilateral-symmetric droplet motion. The electrode designs are scalable and can be fabricated on a flexible and optically transparent substrate: these key advancements will enable consumer applications that were previously inaccessible. A self-cleaning platform was also tested under laboratory conditions and on the road. This technology has significant potential in microfluidics and self-cleaning platforms, for example, in the automotive sector to clean body parts, camera covers, and sensors.},

In the proposed device, the sample and a fluorescence derivatization reagent (Fluoral-P) are mixed in a circular mixing chamber and then flow through a serpentine reaction channel heated to a temperature of 30 {$^\circ$}C by an integrated hotplate. Following a reaction time of 4 min, the microchip is removed from the hotplate and placed in the microscope stage of a laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection system. The formaldehyde concentration of the sample is then inversely derived from the measured value of the fluorescence intensity. The validity of the proposed device is confirmed by comparing the detection results obtained for standard samples with known formaldehyde concentrations ranging from 1 to 50 ppm with those obtained using a traditional UV/VIS absorption spectrometry. The real-world applicability of the proposed device is then demonstrated by measuring the formaldehyde concentration in ten commercial Chinese herbs. It is shown that the measurement results deviate by no more than 3.7\% from those results obtained using colorimetric method by CAAPIC. Overall, the results presented in this study show that the proposed microchip provides a rapid and reliable tool for formaldehyde concentration measurement purposes.},

  abstract = {Digital PCR (dPCR) is a powerful method for the absolute quantification and rare mutation detection of nucleic acids. However, the available dPCR platforms require either expensive instruments or complicated operation, which limit their extensive application. This paper describes a robust self-partition chip to perform dPCR in a very simple and inexpensive format. The chip is constructed by sandwiching a micromolded surfactant-doped PDMS layer between two glass slides, containing 10,000 reaction compartments (0.785 nL each). The two simple strategies, ``glass-PDMS-glass'' sandwich configuration and surfactant-doped surface modification, are used to enhance PCR compatibility and enable efficient amplification in the chip by minimizing water loss and nonspecific adsorption of protein. Furthermore, powered by pre-degassing of its PDMS substrate and an attached PDMS slab, the chip autonomously loads and partitions sample into a high-density array of microwells for performing dPCR analysis. We evaluated the quantitative capabilities of the dPCR chip by measuring a ten-fold serial dilution of genomic DNA from lung cancer cell line H1975. Finally, we also demonstrate its feasibility in the accurate measurement of small copy number variations, which exhibited better accuracy than real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Such simple and low-cost platform promises to accelerate the widespread use of dPCR.},

This paper reviews the deposition of ZnO film and summarizes the factors influencing the microstructure, texture and piezoelectric properties of deposited ZnO films. ZnO acoustic wave devices can be successfully used as biosensors, based on the biomolecule recognition using highly sensitive shear horizontal and Love-wave surface acoustic waves, as well as film bulk acoustic resonator devices. The acoustic wave generated on the ZnO acoustic devices can induce significant acoustic streaming, small scale fluid mixing, pumping, ejection and atomization, depending on the wave mode, amplitude and surface condition. The potential to fabricate an integrated lab-on-a-chip diagnostic system based on these ZnO acoustic wave technologies is also discussed.},

  abstract = {Rapid detection of food-borne pathogens is essential to public health and the food industry. Although the conventional culture method is highly sensitive, it takes at least a few days to detect food-borne pathogens. Even though polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can detect food-borne pathogens in a few hours, it is more expensive and unsatisfactorily sensitive relative to the culture method. We have developed a method to rapidly detect Salmonella enterica by using a compact disc (CD)-shaped device that can reduce reagent consumption in conventional PCR. The detection method, which combines culture and PCR, is more rapid than the conventional culture method and is more sensitive and cheaper than PCR. In this study, we also examined a sample preparation method that involved collecting bacterial cells from food. The bacteria collected from chicken meat spiked with S. enterica were mixed with PCR reagents, and PCR was performed on the device. At a low concentration of S. enterica, the collected S. enterica was cultured before PCR for sensitive detection. After cultivation for 4 h, S. enterica at 1.7 {\textasciicircum} 104 colony-forming units (CFUs){\textasciidieresis} g{\textasciiacute}1 was detected within 8 h, which included the time needed for sample preparation and detection. Furthermore, the detection of 30 CFUs{\textasciidieresis} g{\textasciiacute}1 of S. enterica was possible within 12 h including 8 h for cultivation.},

  abstract = {Biosensors are powerful analytical devices that detect and quantify target analytes in a sample. Due to their high selectivity and sensitivity, enzymes, proteins, antibodies, peptides, and whole cells are commonly used as sensing elements in biosensors. However, the design and optimization of biosensors can be challenging due to the complexity of these biomolecules and their interactions with target analytes. In recent years, computational methods have emerged as powerful tools for designing and optimizing biosensors, enabling researchers to predict the behavior of biomolecules and their interactions with target analytes. Computational fluid mechanics can aid in the design of microfluidic systems for biosensing applications. In contrast, molecular dynamic simulation, molecular docking, quantum mechanics, and virtual screening methods can be used to predict the behavior of biomolecules at the atomic level and study the binding kinetics and thermodynamics of interactions. This paper critically discusses the use of computational methods in biosensors, focusing on enzyme-based, protein-based, antibody-based, peptide-based, and whole-cell-based biosensors. We also review using computational fluid mechanics, molecular dynamic simulation, molecular docking, quantum mechanics, and virtual screening methods in biosensor design and optimization. Additionally, we discuss the applications of these computational methods and biosensors in healthcare, environmental monitoring, food safety, biodefense, and security. Combining computational biosensors and computational methods offers tremendous potential for developing advanced biosensors with enhanced sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. However, challenges remain, such as the need for more accurate models and the integration of experimental and computational approaches. We conclude by discussing the prospects and challenges of computational biosensors and methods, highlighting the need for further research to drive innovation and improve human health and well-being.},

While high throughput manufacturing methods are often preferred for large-volume production, rapid prototyping is necessary for demonstrating and predicting the performance of a device and performing field testing and validation before translating a product from research and development to large volume production. Choosing a specific rapid prototyping method involves considering device design requirements in terms of minimum feature sizes, mechanical stability, thermal and chemical resistance, and optical and electrical properties. A rapid prototyping method is then selected by making engineering trade-off decisions between the suitability of the method in meeting the design specifications and manufacturing metrics such as speed, cost, precision, and potential for scale up. In this review article, we review four categories of rapid prototyping methods that are applicable to developing miniaturized bioanalytical devices, single step, mask and deposit, mask and etch, and mask-free assembly, and we will focus on the trade-offs that need to be made when selecting a particular rapid prototyping method. The focus of the review article will be on the development of systems having a specific arrangement of conductive or semiconductive materials.},

We model the spatial electric field produced by a pair of parallel electrodes and use it to evaluate the stress on the liquid--air interface through Maxwell stresses. By coupling this force with the Young--Laplace equation, we obtain the deformation of the interface. To validate our theory, we design an experimental set-up which uses microfabricated electrodes to achieve spatial dielectrophoretic actuation of a thin liquid film, while providing measurements of microscale deformations through digital holographic microscopy. We characterize the deformation as a function of the electrode-pair geometry and film thickness, showing very good agreement with the model. Based on the insights from the characterization of the system, we pattern conductive lines of electrode pairs on the surface of a microfluidic chamber and demonstrate the ability to produce complex twodimensional deformations. The films can remain in liquid form and be dynamically modulated between different configurations or polymerized to create solid structures with high surface quality.},

It is a field with widely varying disciplines, as it is quite common to see DEP integrated with a host of applications including microfluidics, impedance spectroscopy, tissue engineering, real-time PCR, immunoassays, stem-cell characterization, gene transfection and electroporation, just to name a few. The field is finally at the point where analytical and numerical polarization models can be used to adequately describe and characterize the dielectrophoretic behavior of cells, and there is ever increasing evidence demonstrating that electric fields can safely be used to manipulate cells without harm. As such, DEP is slowly making its way into the biological sciences. Today, DEP is being used to manipulate individual cells to specific regions of space for single-cell assays. DEP is able to separate rare cells from a heterogeneous cell suspension, where isolated cells can then be characterized and dynamically studied using nothing more than electric fields. However, there is need for a critical report to integrate the many new features of DEP for cellular applications. Here, a review of the basic theory and current applications of DEP, specifically for cells, is presented.},

  abstract = {Microfluidic separation technology has garnered significant attention over the past decade where particles are being separated at a micro/nanoscale in a rapid, low-cost, and simple manner. Amongst a myriad of separation technologies that have emerged thus far, acoustic microfluidic separation techniques are extremely apt to applications involving biological samples attributed to various advantages, including high controllability, biocompatibility, and non-invasive, label-free features. With that being said, downsides such as low throughput and dependence on external equipment still impede successful commercialization from laboratory-based prototypes. Here, we present a comprehensive review of recent advances in acoustic microfluidic separation techniques, along with exemplary applications. Specifically, an inclusive overview of fundamental theory and background is presented, then two sets of mechanisms underlying acoustic separation, bulk acoustic wave and surface acoustic wave, are introduced and discussed. Upon these summaries, we present a variety of applications based on acoustic separation. The primary focus is given to those associated with biological samples such as blood cells, cancer cells, proteins, bacteria, viruses, and DNA/RNA. Finally, we highlight the benefits and challenges behind burgeoning developments in the field and discuss the future perspectives and an outlook towards robust, integrated, and commercialized devices based on acoustic microfluidic separation.},

Herein, we report an acoustically-propelled, magnetic-guided, erythrocyte-mimicking hemoglobin micromotor with oxygen-carrying capability. These hemoglobin micromotors were fabricated by encapsulating magnetic nanoparticles in hybrid hemoglobin/calcium carbonate microparticles, followed by covalently layer-by-layer assembly of hemoglobin multilayers. The asymmetric distribution of magnetic nanoparticles enables these micromotors to move rapidly under the propulsion of an acoustic field. The velocity of acoustophoretic motion of hemoglobin micromotors increases with the increase of input voltage of acoustic field, up to 58.2 {$\mu$}m{$\cdot$}s               --1               at 10 V. The hemoglobin micromotors are directionally navigated by applying an external magnetic field, and also could pass through microchannels toward the targeted region. Moreover, such hemoglobin micromotors show effective oxygen loading and releasing capability, holding considerable promise as a new platform for oxygen delivery applications.},

  abstract = {Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is a highly important and attractive conducting polymer as well as commercially available in organic electronics, including electrochemical and electronic chemosensors, due to its unique features such as excellent solutionfabrication capability and miscibility, high and controllable conductivity, excellent chemical and electrochemical stability, good optical transparency and biocompatibility. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the recent research progress of PEDOT:PSS and its composites, and the application in electrochemical and electronic sensors for detecting liquid-phase or gaseous chemical analytes, including inorganic or organic ions, pH, humidity, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), ammonia (NH3), CO, CO2, NO2, and organic solvent vapors like methanol, acetone, etc. We will discuss in detail the structural, architectural and morphological optimization of PEDOT:PSS and its composites with other additives, as well as the fabrication technology of diverse sensor systems in response to a wide range of analytes in varying environments. At the end of the review will be given a perspective summary covering both the key challenges and potential solutions in the future research of PEDOT:PSS-based chemosensors, especially those in a flexible or wearable format.},

The complex of water-soluble conjugated polymer, poly (3-(3 -N,N,N-triethylamino-1 -pro-pyloxy)-4-methyl-2,5-thiophene hydrochloride) (PMNT) and a label-free, mercury-specific oligonucleotide (MSO) probe is used as a mercury detector. While the detector droplet is fixed on the microfluidic chip, the target mercury ionic droplet is transported to the detector and then mixed together by electrostatic force driving, resulting in the color of the detector changing from red to yellow. We demonstrate that the detection system is portable and highly selective, and it can identify micromolar concentrations within minutes with the naked eye.},

It covers various environmental areas that would benefit from these developments, including nanomachine-enabled degradation and removal of major contaminants or nanomotor-based water quality monitoring. Future operations of autonomous intelligent multifunctional nanomachines, monitoring and responding to hazardous chemicals (in a ``sense and destroy'' mode) and using bioinspired chemotactic search strategies to trace chemical plumes to their source, are discussed, along with the challenges of moving these exciting research efforts to larger-scale pilot studies and eventually to field applications.

Conventional detection methods like the plate counting and molecular diagnosis strategies are still not suitable for timely and rapid on-site detection due to the cumbersome operations, requirement of trained operators and sophisticated instruments. Microfluidics provide a powerful tool for pathogen detection due to the intrinsic advantages including easy integration, miniaturization, portability, and small sample consumption. Up to now, many research works have reported the combination of microfluidics with various detection techniques and signal amplification technologies to achieve the rapid and sensitive detection of foodborne pathogens. In this review, we mainly summarized the significant developed microfluidic based devices for pathogenic bacteria detection over the past five years, including (1) integration of sample preparation techniques like cell capture and enrichment, and nucleic acid related sample preparation methods on chip; (2) various detection methods, such as colorimetric, fluorescence, chemiluminescence, and mass spectrometry; (3) microfluidic paper-based analytical devices, particularly for the applications in resource-limited settings, remote areas or on-site detection. The limitations and advantages of these methods were summarized and discussed in order to comprehensively understand the latest microfluidic-based detection techniques for foodborne pathogens. Finally, the future challenges and directions for pathogens detection based on microfluidic based biosensors were also discussed and summarized.},

Detailed mathematical discussion shows that threshold force for mobilization is a function of droplet size and liquid parameters, and droplet velocity after depinning is a function of applied thermal gradient, droplet size and liquid parameters. The device with Ti as micro-heater, Au film as pad, Cr/Au as controlling electrode arrays, high quality SiO2 film as dielectric layer on glass substrate is fabricated by silicon bulk process and employs fluorocarbon polymer as hydrophobic layer to functionalize the surface to be hydrophobic so as to facilitate droplet transportation. Test results show that transportation velocity of 3 {\textmu}l DI water and silicone oil can reach 0.1 mm/s and 1 mm/s respectively at a voltage of 7 V. Driving voltage, transportation velocity of droplets and effect of contact angle hysteresis are discussed and the results are in agreement with theoretical results. The results provide some practical guidelines for the design of microfluidic chips based on thermocapillary actuation. In this study, we demonstrated that thermocapillary actuation of droplets is tunable and the chip can find great application in lab-on-a-chip due to its simple structure and low-cost fabrication process.},

  abstract = {Motion control is widely used in industrial applications since machinery, robots, conveyor bands use smooth movements in order to reach a desired position decreasing the steady error and energy consumption. In this paper, a new Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) -type fuzzy logic controller (FLC) tuning strategy that is based on direct fuzzy relations is proposed in order to compute the PID constants. The motion control algorithm is composed by PID-type FLC and S-curve velocity profile, which is developed in C/C++ programming language; therefore, a license is not required to reproduce the code among embedded systems. The self-tuning controller is carried out online, it depends on error and change in error to adapt according to the system variations. The experimental results were obtained in a linear platform integrated by a direct current (DC) motor connected to an encoder to measure the position. The shaft of the motor is connected to an endless screw; a cart is placed on the screw to control its position. The rise time, overshoot, and settling time values measured in the experimentation are 0.124 s, 8.985\% and 0.248 s, respectively. These results presented in part 6 demonstrate the performance of the controller, since the rise time and settling time are improved according to the state of the art. Besides, these parameters are compared with different control architectures reported in the literature. This comparison is made after applying a step input signal to the DC motor.},

The depFFF method can not only exploit intrinsic tumor cell properties so that labeling is unnecessary but can also deliver unmodified, viable tumor cells for culture and/or all types of molecular analysis. We investigated tumor cell recovery efficiency as a function of cell loading for a 25\,mm wide {\texttimes} 300\,mm long depFFF chamber. More than 90\% of tumor cells were recovered for small samples but a larger chamber will be required if similarly high recovery efficiencies are to be realized for 10\,mL blood specimens used CTC analysis in clinics. We show that the factor limiting isolation efficiency is cell--cell dielectric interactions and that isolation protocols should be completed within {$\sim$}15\,min in order to avoid changes in cell dielectric properties associated with ion leakage.},

In this paper, a technology is described which creates microfluidics on a PCB substrate using an mSLA printer. All steps of the production process can be carried out with commercially available printers and resins: this includes the structuring of the copper layer of the PCB and the buildup of the channel layer on top of the PCB. Copper trace dimensions down to 100 {\textmu}m and channel dimensions of 800 {\textmu}m are feasible. The described technology is a low-cost solution for combining PCBs and microfluidics.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new method to construct microfluidic devices especially useful for bulk acoustic wave (BAW)-based manipulation of cells and microparticles. To obtain efficient acoustic focusing, BAW devices require materials that have high acoustic impedance mismatch relative to the medium in which the cells/microparticles are suspended and materials with a high-quality factor. To date, silicon and glass have been the materials of choice for BAW-based acoustofluidic channel fabrication. Siliconand glass-based fabrication is typically performed in clean room facilities, generates hazardous waste, and can take several hours to complete the microfabrication. To address some of the drawbacks in fabricating conventional BAW devices, we explored a new approach by micromachining microfluidic channels in aluminum substrates. Additionally, we demonstrate plasma bonding of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) onto micromachined aluminum substrates. Our goal was to achieve an approach that is both low cost and effective in BAW applications. To this end, we micromachined aluminum 6061 plates and enclosed the systems with a thin PDMS cover layer. These aluminum/PDMS hybrid microfluidic devices use inexpensive materials and are simply constructed outside a clean room environment. Moreover, these devices demonstrate effectiveness in BAW applications as demonstrated by efficient acoustic focusing of polystyrene microspheres, bovine red blood cells, and Jurkat cells and the generation of multiple focused streams in flow-through systems.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) and dielectrowetting (DEW) are two major principles to drive droplets in digital microfluidics. EWOD is effective to manipulate (create, transport, split, and merge) conductive droplets being currently used for many biological, chemical, and optical applications. DEW can also manipulate droplets but more efficiently with dielectric (nonconductive) fluids. A digital microfluidic platform efficiently operable by both EWOD and DEW would offer higher versatility in handling a wide range of fluids, regardless of their conductivities. In this regard, this article presents a new hybrid electrode design enabling EWOD and DEW to drive various kinds of droplet fluids on a single platform. In addition, a slippery liquid-infused surface (SLIPS) is integrated with the hybrid electrodes. The SLIPS is well known to resist biofouling and repel sticky fluids, which endows the hybrid electrodes with much wider application spectra. As a result, the present SLIPS-integrated hybrid electrodes facilitate actuating various kinds of fluids which would not be driven by conventional EWOD and/or DEW electrodes. This paper presents the successful transportation of not only conductive fluids including water, protein solution, glycerol, and honey but also nonconductive fluids including dodecane, silicone oil, and light and heavy crude oil, all driven by the SLIPS-integrated hybrid electrodes. The performance comparisons among solid, interdigitating, and hybrid electrodes are made by testing both conductive and nonconductive droplets.},

Next, we conceptualize how different technologies are converging into working microfluidic POC diagnostics devices.

  abstract = {Rivers are important natural resources of a country as they provide a wide range of ecosystem services. However, the problem is that rivers in Malaysia are badly degraded due to mismanagement, neglect, pollution and abuse. River management in Malaysia is largely based on the government-centric top-down model which is sectoral-based. This model is ineffective as it has no private sector, NGO and public engagement and support. This paper aims to examine various types of river management models to identify the ones that can be effective in Malaysia. The methodology used a mixture of literature review of existing river management models, secondary data on published journal papers, reports and books on river management. Results of selected river management conferences are also studied, examined and findings synthesized. Primary data is also compiled with selected in-depth qualitative interviews with key government officers, managers of private companies, NGO officers and village heads. Results show that the government (various levels) is traditionally the responsible party in managing rivers, but increasingly, the public, NGOs, businesses and other stakeholders are actively involved. Results also show that holistic river management with active engagement of all stakeholders is necessary. In Malaysia, rivers are found to be intricately intertwined with all aspects of development. It was concluded that the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model is an effective river management model in Malaysia as it conserves the river and its environment, and brings together all parties for building their capacities in river management towards achieving many Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).},

  abstract = {Both passive and active microfluidic chips are used in many biomedical and chemical ap-plications to support fluid mixing, particle manipulations, and signal detection. Passive microfluidic devices are geometry-dependent, and their uses are rather limited. Active microfluidic devices in-clude sensors or detectors that transduce chemical, biological, and physical changes into electrical or optical signals. Also, they are transduction devices that detect biological and chemical changes in biomedical applications, and they are highly versatile microfluidic tools for disease diagnosis and organ modeling. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the significant advances that have been made in the development of microfluidics devices. We will discuss the function of mi-crofluidic devices as micromixers or as sorters of cells and substances (e.g., microfiltration, flow or displacement, and trapping). Microfluidic devices are fabricated using a range of techniques, includ-ing molding, etching, three-dimensional printing, and nanofabrication. Their broad utility lies in the detection of diagnostic biomarkers and organ-on-chip approaches that permit disease modeling in cancer, as well as uses in neurological, cardiovascular, hepatic, and pulmonary diseases. Biosensor applications allow for point-of-care testing, using assays based on enzymes, nanozymes, antibodies, or nucleic acids (DNA or RNA). An anticipated development in the field includes the optimization of techniques for the fabrication of microfluidic devices using biocompatible materials. These devel-opments will increase biomedical versatility, reduce diagnostic costs, and accelerate diagnosis time of microfluidics technology.},

  abstract = {The ability of liquid metals (LMs) to recover from repeated stretching and deformation is a particularly attractive attribute for soft bioelectronics. In addition to their high electrical and thermal conductivity, LMs can be actuated, potentially enabling highly durable electro-mechanical and microfluidics systems for applications such as cooling, drug delivery, or reconfigurable electronics. In particular, continuous electrowetting (CEW) phenomena can actuate liquid metal at relatively low voltage and affordable power requirements for wearable systems ({\textasciitilde} {$<$} 10 V, {\textasciitilde} 10 -- 100 {\textmu}W) by inducing a surface tension gradient across the LM. However, sustaining LM actuation remains challenging due to factors such as electrolyte depletion, polarity changes in multi-electrode systems, and limitations related to LM composition. Here, we demonstrate LM actuation in a circular conduit for prolonged durations of at least nine hours. We enabled sustained actuation by sequentially applying short, direct current (DC) pulses through a multi-electrode system based on the dynamics of LM actuation. As a proof of concept, we also demonstrated the ability of LM to transport electrically conducting, non-conducting, and magnetic materials within a microchannel and show the liquid metal actuation system can be potentially miniaturized to the size of a wearable device. We envision that with further miniaturization of the device architectures, our CEW platform can enable future integration of low-voltage electro-mechanical systems into a broad range of wearable form factors.},

The fabricated sensor showed sensitivity to detect ammonia concentration as low as 430 ppb. The response characteristics of the sensor as a function of ammonia concentrations (varying from 400 to 4000 ppm) is reported in the paper. It also describes the variation in the response characteristics in flat and bent positions of the sensors. The reproducibility of the sensor performance is also established by the results presented in the paper.},

Hence dependability is an essential attribute before the chip is in use. Due to mixed integration technologies, these chips have some unique failures. Hence robust offline and online tests are proposed to check the health of the biochips. When a chip undergoes a test in offline mode, then the entire biochip should be available for testing, whereas for the online mode test droplet might be stalled due to unavailability of the next cell in the routing path. However, in both the scenarios one or more droplets route across the chip and the arrival time is also recorded at the destination. So here we have proposed two test schemes to know the correctness of any biochip. Diagnosability is an important feature to find the exact position of the faulty electrode. Our proposed scheme reduces the overall testing and diagnosis time significantly. It also provides an alternative routing path in biochip for fault tolerance.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), one of the techniques for electrochemical analysis, has been used for a wide range of applications especially chemical- and bio-sensing. Besides, EIS is one of the few techniques that has been proven useful for membrane fouling detection. Electrodes are some of the most essential components for analytes detection applications with EIS. With the advances in printing technology, the fabrication of advanced printed electrode systems with miniature designs and improved sensitivity for electrochemical sensing is made possible. This review addresses recent advances in printed electrodes for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy with the emphasis placed on discussing the use of printed electrodes for membrane fouling detection. Common electrode designs and materials for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are discussed, along with practical examples of these printed electrodes. The commonly used printing techniques for the fabrication of printed electrodes are also deliberated. The successful realization of printed electrodes for EIS requires careful design of electrodes, proper selection of electrode materials, as well as optimization of the printing process. It is expected that printed electrodes will be widely accepted for EIS sensing applications and will facilitate the creation of low-cost high-performance sensing devices.},

Fortunately, advances in personal computing associated with free and open-source software production facilitate this work of prospecting and understanding complex scenarios. Thus, for the development of this work, the keywords ``biofuel'' and ``nanocatalyst'' were delivered to the Scopus database, which returned 1071 scientific articles. The titles and abstracts of these papers were saved in Research Information Systems (RIS) format and submitted to automatic analysis via the Visualization of Similarities Method implemented in VOSviewer 1.6.18 software. Then, the data extracted from the VOSviewer were processed by software written in Python, which allowed the use of the network data generated by the Visualization of Similarities Method. Thus, it was possible to establish the relationships for the pair between the nodes of all clusters classified by Link Strength Between Items or Terms (LSBI) or by year. Indeed, other associations should arouse particular interest in the readers. However, here, the option was for a numerical criterion. However, all data are freely available, and stakeholders can infer other specific connections directly. Therefore, this innovative approach allowed inferring that the most recent pairs of terms associate the need to produce biofuels from microorganisms' oils besides cerium oxide nanoparticles to improve the performance of fuel mixtures by reducing the emission of hydrocarbons (HC) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx).},

One of the most important stages in this process requires rapid and effective identification of pathogenic bacteria responsible for diseases. Current gold standard techniques of bacterial detection include culture methods, polymerase chain reactions, and immunoassays. However, their use is fraught with downsides with high turnaround time and low accuracy being the most prominent. This imposes great limitations on their eventual application as point-of-care devices. Over time, innovative detection techniques have been proposed and developed to curb these drawbacks. In this review, a systematic summary of a range of biosensing platforms is provided with a strong focus on technologies conferring high detection sensitivity and specificity. A thorough analysis is performed and the benefits and drawbacks of each type of biosensor are highlighted, the factors influencing their potential as point-of-care devices are discussed, and the authors' insights for their translation from proof-of-concept systems into commercial medical devices are provided.},

  abstract = {Microfluidics offer many advantages to Point of Care (POC) devices through lower reagent use and smaller size. Additionally, POC devices offer the unique potential to conduct tests outside of the laboratory. In particular, Electro-wetting on Dielectric (EWOD) microfluidics has been shown to be an effective way to move and mix liquids enabling many PoC devices. However, much of the research surrounding these microfluidic systems are focused on a single aspect of the system capability, such as droplet control or a specific new application at the device level using the EWOD technology. Often in these experiments the supporting systems required for operation are bench top equipment such as function generators, power supplies, and personal computers. Although various aspects of how an EWOD device is capable of moving and mixing droplets have been demonstrated at various levels, a complete self-contained and portable lab-on-a-chip system based on the EWOD technology has not been well demonstrated. For instance, EWOD systems tend to use high voltage alternating current (AC) signals to actuate electrodes, but little consideration is given to circuitry size or power consumption of such components to make the entire system portable. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of integrating all supporting hardware and software to correctly operate an EWOD device in a completely self-contained and battery-powered handheld unit. We present results that demonstrate a complete sample preparation flow for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction and isolation. The device was designed to be a field deployable, hand-held platform capable of performing many other sample preparation tasks automatically. Liquids are transported using EWOD and controlled via a programmable microprocessor. The programmable nature of the device allows it to be configured for a variety of tests for different applications. Many considerations were given towards power consumption, size, and system complexity which make it ideal for use in a mobile environment. The results presented in this paper show a promising step forward to the portable capability of microfluidic devices based on the EWOD technology.},

Microarrays are commonly used in gene sequencing, pathogen detection, determining microbial resistances, and conducting enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). As droplets in these arrays dry, the majority of material within the droplet is deposited around the periphery. This phenomenon is referred to as the coffee stain effect. The non-uniform depositions left by this effect can result in variation of fluorescence intensity measurements in automated vision systems. A means of producing more uniform particle depositions for the microscopy analysis would allow for more accurate test results.},

A digital microfluidic system typically consists of a planar array of cells with electrodes that control the droplets. The primary challenge in using droplet-based systems is that they require the simultaneous coordination of a potentially large number of droplets on the array as the droplets move, mix, and split. In this paper we describe a general-purpose system that uses simple algorithms and yet is versatile. First, we present a semi-automated approach to generate the array layout in terms of components. Next, we discuss simple algorithms to select destination components for the droplets and a decentralized scheme for components to route the droplets on the array. These are then combined into a reconfigurable system that has been simulated in software to perform analyses such as the DNA polymerase chain reaction. The algorithms have been able to successfully coordinate hundreds of droplets simultaneously and perform one or more chemical analyses in parallel. Because it is challenging to analytically characterize the behavior of such systems, simulation methods to detect potential system instability are proposed.},

  abstract = {The complexity of droplet microfluidics grows with the implementation of parallel processes and multiple functionalities on a single device. This poses a severe challenge to the engineer designing the corresponding microfluidic networks. In today's design processes, the engineer relies on calculations, assumptions, simplifications, as well as his/her experiences and intuitions. To validate the obtained specification of the microfluidic network, usually a prototype is fabricated and physical experiments are conducted thus far. In case the design does not implement the desired functionality, this prototyping iteration is repeated---obviously resulting in an expensive and time-consuming design process. To avoid unnecessary debugging loops involving fabrication and testing, simulation methods could help to initially validate the specification of the microfluidic network before any prototype is fabricated. However, state-of-the-art simulation tools come with severe limitations, which prevent their utilization for practically relevant applications. More precisely, they are often not dedicated to droplet microfluidics, cannot handle the required physical phenomena, are not publicly available, and can hardly be extended. In this work, we present an advanced simulation approach for droplet microfluidics that addresses these shortcomings and, eventually, allows simulating practically relevant applications. To this end, we propose a simulation framework at the one-dimensional analysis model, which directly works on the specification of the design, supports essential physical phenomena, is publicly available, and is easy to extend. Evaluations and case studies demonstrate the benefits of the proposed simulator: While current state-of-the-art tools were not applicable for practically relevant microfluidic networks, the proposed simulator allows reducing the design time and costs, e.g., of a drug screening device from one person month and USD 1200, respectively, to just a fraction of that.},

The objective of this flow is to facilitate fast assay synthesis while minimally compromising the quality of results. In particular, we show that a virtual topology, which constrains the allowable locations of assay operations such as mixing, dilution, sensing, etc., in lieu of traditional placement, can significantly speed up the synthesis process without significantly lengthening assay execution time. We present a base virtual topology and show how it can be leveraged to reduce algorithmic runtimes and guarantee rout ability. We later present several variations of the virtual topology and present experimental results demonstrating best-design practices. We present two binding solutions. The first is a left-edge binding algorithm, while the second is a more intelligent path-based binding algorithm that leverages spatial and temporal locality to produce superior results.},

Improvements are displayed based on the impact on a new generation of SAW sensors working efficiently in liquid media, from modeling to the fabrication steps of the individual components. It is explained, which obstacles have to be overcome for applications to the bioanalytical field. SAW sensors are shown to be extremely useful for the analysis of both small and large molecules as well as whole cells interacting with an immobilized binding partner. The output signal gives information about the pure mass loading, intrinsic properties of bound materials, or viscoelastic effects like structural rearrangements. Different setups are shown that minimize the influence of physical bulk effects on the sensor signal, e.g. salt content and viscosity. The choice of materials which can be used for sensible surfaces are presented, enabling the development of completely new coupling chemistries. Finally, the advantages compared to other biosensor technologies are pointed out.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting-based microdrop manipulation has received considerable attention owing to its wide applications in numerous scientific areas based on the digital microfluidics (DMF) technology. However, the techniques for highly precise droplet handling in such microscopic systems are still unclear. In this work, the deformation, speed, and stability of droplet transporting in closed electrowetting-based DMF systems are comprehensively investigated with both theoretical and numerical analyses. First, a theoretical model is derived which governs the droplet motion and includes the influences of the key electrowetting system parameters. After that, a finite volume formulation with a two-step projection method is used for solving the microfluidic flow on a fixed numerical domain. The liquid-gas interface of the droplet is tracked by a coupled level-set and volume-of-fluid method, and the surface tension at the interface is computed by the continuum surface force scheme. A parametric study has been carried out to examine the effects of the static contact angles ({\texttheta}s,ON and {\texttheta}s,OFF), hysteresis effect (∆{\texttheta}), channel height (H), and electrode size (LE) on droplet shape, speed, and deformation during transport, which unanimously shows that droplet length, neck width, and transport stability are directly related to a dimensionless parameter {$\kappa\ast$} that only comprises {\texttheta}s,ON , {\texttheta}s,OFF, H, LE, and the hysteresis angle ∆{\texttheta}. Based on the results, the scaling laws for estimating droplet shape and stability of the transport process have been developed, which can be used for promoting the accuracy and efficiency of droplet manipulation in a large variety of droplet-based DMF applications.},

A great deal of effort has been devoted to advancing this technology by means of enhancing droplet speed and stability. In this work, we numerically investigate the continuous droplet transport process in a parallel-plate EWOD DMF device with a previously proposed ``stripped electrode'' design and compare it with the transport motion of the conventional ``square electrode'' design. The microfluidic droplet motion is solved by a finite volume formulation on a fixed computational domain. The gas-liquid interface of a droplet is captured by a coupled level-set and volume-of-fluid scheme with the surface tension force at the interface computed by the continuum surface force method. A simplified viscous stress scheme reliant on the Hele-Shaw flow model is used to evaluate the viscous forces exerted by the parallel plates. The numerically simulated transport processes of the ``stripped electrode'' and ``square electrode'' designs show good agreement with the experimental results. Furthermore, a parametric study is conducted in which the influences of the strip number, activated contact angle, and gap spacing between the plates on droplet transport speed and stability are examined. It has been found that both the transport speed and stability can be noticeably improved by the ``stripped electrode'' design, which can be adopted for promoting the transport efficiency in a large number of droplet-based applications utilizing parallel-plate EWOD DMF systems.},

In this work, we propose a new configuration comprising only stripped electrodes of rectangular shape for the closed electrowetting-on-dielectric digital microfluidic (EWOD DMF) system and investigate its parallel microdrop generation outcomes via a numerical approach. The microfluidic droplet motion is solved by a finite-volume scheme on a fixed computational domain. The numerical model is verified by an experimental study of microdrop production from an EWOD DMF device with three different electrode designs. After model verification, we examine the influences of the equilibrium contact angle and the spacing of the microchannel on stripped electrode based microdrop generation outcomes and discover five different regimes including the phenomena of satellite droplet formation and separation cessation. Despite the various generation outcomes, the daughter droplet size is found to vary linearly with a dimensionless EWOD parameter {$\kappa$}*. More importantly, for all successful generations, the deviation of the daughter droplet size from that of the stripped electrode is smaller than 3.5\%, which even reaches zero in proper conditions. This new configuration can be utilized as a convenient alternative for electrowetting-induced parallel microdrop production with excellent precision and controllability.},

Within this platform, the formation and merging of droplets inside an immiscible carrier fluid are two key procedures: (i) the emulsification step should lead to a very well controlled drop size (distribution); and (ii) the use of droplet as micro-reactors requires a reliable merging. A novel trend within this field is the use of additional active means of control besides the commonly used hydrodynamic manipulation. Electric fields are especially suitable for this, due to quantitative control over the amplitude and time dependence of the signals, and the flexibility in designing micro-electrode geometries. With this, the formation and merging of droplets can be achieved on-demand and with high precision. In this review on two-phase flow microfluidics, particular emphasis is given on these aspects. Also recent innovations in microfabrication technologies used for this purpose will be discussed.},

  abstract = {A simple and low budget microfabrication method compatible with mass production was developed for the integration of electrodes for capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection (C4D) in Lab on a Chip devices. Electrodes were patterned on a printed circuit board using standard processing. This was followed by lamination--photolithography--lamination to cover the electrodes in dry film photoresist (DFR) using an office laminator. This resulted in a flush, smooth surface on top of the detection electrodes, enabling subsequent integration of a microfluidic network at a distance dictated by the thickness of the DFR (17 m, 30 m and 60 m were used in this work). This process was applied to create two types of detectors, re-usable detectors to be used in combination with a separate microfluidic network and integrated detectors where the microfluidic network is irreversibly sealed to the detector. A poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) slab containing the microfluidic network was positioned on top of the re-usable detectors to create the PDMS hybrid devices. The integrated DFR devices were created by patterning and sealing the microchannel in DFR using subsequent lamination and lithographic steps. The sensitivity of the C4D made using this new technology for small inorganic cations was between 6 and 20 M, which is comparable with devices made using significantly more advanced technologies. Where the 17 m film slightly improved the sensitivity, the use of 30 m thick insulating films was preferred as these did not impose significant restrictions on the applicable field strengths.},

  abstract = {The use of impedimetric biosensors based on interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) for biochemical applications has gained increased interest during the last two decades. Recently a concept of a 3D-IDEs with insulating barriers separating electrodes digits was introduced. This geometry enhances the sensitivity of the transducer to biochemical reactions at the sensor surface. Although there is an experimental evidence of this increase in the sensitivity, its quantification is currently unstudied. In this work the impact of the geometry on sensitivity of IDEs impedimetric biosensors based on surface conductivity variations is studied. For that a finite elements method (FEM) model that takes into account the surface conductivity phenomena has been developed. Its feasibility has been validated comparing modeled and experimental results obtained in immunochemical reaction of IgG protein. Using this FEM model the increase of sensitivity produced by the presence of a dielectric barrier between the electrodes has been quantified. Moreover, the biosensor response has also been analyzed taking into account different geometrical parameters such as electrode width or separation. Finally, this work proposes the design guidelines for maximizing and improving the sensitivity of IDEs based biosensors.},

To realize the on-chip repeatable colorimetric analysis, a novel printed circuit board (PCB)-based DMF chip was designed with an embedded aperture on the actuator electrode, forming a vertical light path for online measurement of the droplets. The capabilities of the DMF platform enable automatic manipulation of microliter-level droplets to implement Griess assay without the use of external systems such as syringe, pump, or valve, which provides the benefits including high flexibility, portability, miniature size, and low cost. Results indicated the characteristics of good linearity (R2 = 0.9974), the ignorable crosstalk for reusability, and the limit of detection (LOD) of nitrite as low as 5 {$\mu$}g/L. Furthermore, the presented platform was successfully applied to determine nitrite levels in food products with reliable results and satisfactory recoveries. This integrated DMF platform can be a promising new tool for a wide range of applications involving step-by-step solution mixing and optical detection in environmental monitoring, food safety analysis, and point-of-care testing.},

Among these, nanomaterials are considered to be most promising, owing to their strong adsorption, fast electron transfer kinetics, and biocompatibility, which are very apt for biosensing applications. The coupling of electrochemical techniques with nanomaterials has enhanced the sensitivity, limit of detection, and robustness of the sensors. In this review, toxicity mechanisms of various metal ions and their relationship towards the induction of oxidative stress have been summarized.

Superhydrophobicity is closely related to surface structuring and other surfaces with overhanging structures have been shown to possess robust superhydrophobic properties. In effort to correlate the wetting performance and surface structuring of the cuticles, from both a technical and evolutionary point of view, we investigated a selection of Collembola species including species from several families and covering habitats ranging from aquatic to very dry. The observed contact angles of wetting was in general larger than those predicted by the conventional models. Not all the studied Collembola were found to have superhydrophobic properties, indicating that superhydrophobicity is common, but not a universal trait in Collembola. Overhanging structures were found in some, but not all Collembola species with superhydrophobic cuticles; which leads to the conclusion that there is no direct link between overhanging surface structures and superhydrophobicity in Collembola.},

  abstract = {Electrohydrodynamic wetting manipulation plays a major role in modern microfluidic technologies such as lab-on-a-chip applications and digital microfluidics. Liquid dielectrophoresis (LDEP) is a common driving mechanism, which induces hydrodynamic motion in liquids by the application of nonhomogeneous electrical fields. Among strategies to analyze droplet movement, systematic research on the influence of different frequencies under AC voltage is missing. In this paper, we therefore present a first study covering the motion characteristics of LDEP-driven droplets of the dielectric liquids ethylene glycol and glycerol carbonate in the driving voltage frequency range from 50 Hz to 1600 Hz. A correlation between the switching speed of LDEP-actuated droplets in a planar electrode configuration and the frequency of the applied voltage is shown. Hereby, motion times of different-sized droplets could be reduced by up to a factor of 5.3. A possible excitation of the droplets within their range of eigenfrequencies is investigated using numerical calculations. The featured fluidic device is designed using larger-sized electrodes rather than typical finger or strip electrodes, which are commonly employed in LDEP devices. The influence of the electrode shape is considered simulatively by studying the electric field gradients.},

Given the high level of variability in droplet manipulation, it is essential to establish self-adaptive and intelligent control methods for DMF systems that are informed by the transient state of droplets and their interactions. However, most related studies focus on droplet localization and shape recognition. In this study, we develop the AI-assisted DMF framework {$\mu$}DropAI for multistate droplet control on the basis of droplet morphology. The semantic segmentation model is integrated into our custom-designed DMF system to recognize the droplet states and their interactions for feedback control with a state machine. The proposed model has strong flexibility and can recognize droplets of different colors and shapes with an error rate of less than 0.63\%; it enables control of droplets without user intervention. The coefficient of variation (CV) of the volumes of split droplets can be limited to 2.74\%, which is lower than the CV of traditional dispensed droplets, contributing to an improvement in the precision of volume control for droplet splitting. The proposed system inspires the development of semantic-driven DMF systems that can interface with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for fully automatic control.},

However, conventional methods for               K               d               characterization usually involve a multi-step process and time-consuming operations for incubation, washing, and detection, thus causing problems, such as time delays, microbead loss, degradation of sensitive molecules, and personal errors. Here we demonstrate an automated ligand binding affinity evaluation platform (Auto-affitech) using digital microfluidics (DMF), with individual droplets at the microliter level, programmed to rapidly perform the incubation and separation of target-beads and binding ligands. Because the loss of the beads influences the detection results, we propose a new strategy for magnetic bead separation using DMF, termed the bidirectional separation method. By splitting one droplet into two asymmetric droplets, high bead retention efficiency (89.57\% {\textpm} 0.05\%) and high washing efficiency (99.59\% {\textpm} 0.17\%, with four washings) were obtained. We demonstrate the determination of               K               d               of an aptamer--protein system (EpCAM and its corresponding aptamer SYL3C) and an antigen--antibody system (H5N1 antigen and antibody), proving the capability and universality of Auto-affitech in various receptor--ligand systems. Integrating all the sample processing procedures, the Auto-affitech not only saves manual labor and minimizes personal errors, but also conserves samples and shortens analysis time. Overall, this platform successfully demonstrates to be an automated approach for dissociation constant evaluation and exhibits great potential for highly efficient screening of ligands.},

Here, we reported an immunosensor to fast detect Salmonella using Fe-MIL-88NH2 metal-organic framework (FeMOF) nanocubes to load platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) for signal amplification and smartphone thermal imaging to monitor the temperature change. The FeMOF nanocubes decorated with PtNPs (Fe-MOF/PtNPs) were prepared as peroxidase mimics to catalyze hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to produce O2. The immune magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), the target bacteria, and the immune FeMOF/PtNPs were first mixed by the three-dimensional (3D) chaotic micromixer and conjugated in the microfluidic chip to form MNP-bacteria-Fe-MOF/PtNPs sandwich complexes. After magnetic separation and washing, H2O2 was injected and decomposed by Fe-MOF/PtNPs on the sandwich complexes to generate O2 in a sealed chamber. The increase in the pressure pushed the preloaded water to react with calcium oxide powder, resulting in the generation of heat, which was measured using the smartphone-based thermal sensor to determine the bacteria. The microfluidic immunosensor could detect Salmonella as low as 93 CFU/mL within 1 h.},

  abstract = {Significance             We present 3D acoustic tweezers, which can trap and manipulate single cells and particles along three mutually orthogonal axes of motion by recourse to surface acoustic waves. We use 3D acoustic tweezers to pick up single cells, or entire cell assemblies, and deliver them to desired locations to create 2D and 3D cell patterns, or print the cells into complex shapes. This technology is thus shown to offer better performance over prior cell manipulation techniques in terms of both accurate and precise motion in a noninvasive, label-free, and contactless manner. This method offers the potential to accurately print 3D multicellular architectures for applications in biomanufacturing, tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, neuroscience, and cancer metastasis research.           ,              The ability of surface acoustic waves to trap and manipulate micrometer-scale particles and biological cells has led to many applications involving ``acoustic tweezers'' in biology, chemistry, engineering, and medicine. Here, we present 3D acoustic tweezers, which use surface acoustic waves to create 3D trapping nodes for the capture and manipulation of microparticles and cells along three mutually orthogonal axes. In this method, we use standing-wave phase shifts to move particles or cells in-plane, whereas the amplitude of acoustic vibrations is used to control particle motion along an orthogonal plane. We demonstrate, through controlled experiments guided by simulations, how acoustic vibrations result in micromanipulations in a microfluidic chamber by invoking physical principles that underlie the formation and regulation of complex, volumetric trapping nodes of particles and biological cells. We further show how 3D acoustic tweezers can be used to pick up, translate, and print single cells and cell assemblies to create 2D and 3D structures in a precise, noninvasive, label-free, and contact-free manner.},

  abstract = {In recent years, additive manufacturing has steadily gained attention in both research and industry. Applications range from prototyping to small-scale production, with 3D printing offering reduced logistics overheads, better design flexibility and ease of use compared with traditional fabrication methods. In addition, printer and material costs have also decreased rapidly. These advantages make 3D printing attractive for application in microfluidic chip fabrication. However, 3D printing microfluidics is still a new area. Is the technology mature enough to print complex microchannel geometries, such as droplet microfluidics? Can 3D-printed droplet microfluidic chips be used in biological or chemical applications? Is 3D printing mature enough to be used in every research lab? These are the questions we will seek answers to in our systematic review. We will analyze (1) the key performance metrics of 3D-printed droplet microfluidics and (2) existing biological or chemical application areas. In addition, we evaluate (3) the potential of large-scale application of 3D printing microfluidics. Finally, (4) we discuss how 3D printing and digital design automation could trivialize microfluidic chip fabrication in the long term. Based on our analysis, we can conclude that today, 3D printers could already be used in every research lab. Printing droplet microfluidics is also a possibility, albeit with some challenges discussed in this review.},

  abstract = {The heat transport capacity of traditional heat pipes is limited by the capillary pressure generated in the internal wick that pumps condensate to the evaporator. Recently, the authors conceptualized a novel heat pipe architecture, wherein wick-based pumping is replaced by electrowetting (EW)-based pumping of microliter droplets in the adiabatic section. An electrowetting heat pipe (EHP) can overcome the capillary limit to heat transport capacity and enable compact, planar, gravity-insensitive, and ultralow power consumption heat pipes that transport kiloWatt heat loads over extended distances. This work develops a novel technique for rapid, scalable fabrication of EW-based devices and studies critical microfluidic operations underlying the EHP, with the objective of predicting the key performance parameters of the EHP. Devices are fabricated on a printed circuit board (PCB) substrate with mechanically-milled electrodes, and a removable polyimide dielectric film. The first set of experiments uncovers the maximum channel gap (1 mm) for reliable EW-based pumping; this parameter determines the heat transport capacity of the EHP, which scales linearly with the channel gap. The second set of experiments uncovers the maximum channel gap (375 microns) at which EW voltages can successfully split droplets. This is an important consideration which ensures EHP operability in the event of unintentional droplet merging. The third set of experiments demonstrate and study EW-induced droplet generation from an open-to-air reservoir, which mimics the interface between the condenser and adiabatic sections of the EHP. The experimental findings predict that planar, water-based EHPs with a (10 cm by 4 mm) cross section can transport 1.6 kW over extended distances ({$>$}1 m), with a thermal resistance of 0.01 K W-1.},

Through designing the biosensor in such a way that it becomes a membrane with holes, we can apply a droplet on it and push or pull it through the membrane by means of a pressure difference. Contrary to traditional microfluidics for, e.g., flow cells where the analyte flows over the sensor, the flow is now directed through the sensor. We have implemented this scheme in silicon-on-insulator biosensors and have demonstrated in a first proof-of-principle experiment, an improvement in delivery time of at least a factor of three.},

  abstract = {Two-phase flow microfluidics is a promising platform for realizing Lab-on-a-Chip (LoC) devices, that perform different laboratory functions on a single chip. This is accomplished by processing droplets, containing biological/chemical samples, by different elements each performing specific operations. Usually, the sequence of elements in which droplets are processed is fixed, which limits the flexibility, effectiveness and reusability of such LoC devices. Recently, microfluidic networks for two-phase flow microfluidics have been introduced with the aim of realizing programmable and flexible LoC devices. In particular, the goal is to dynamically and passively assign the droplets' path through a microfluidic network, which enables to reuse the LoC devices for different laboratory functions. This paper presents the state-of-the-art and discusses various aspects of the practical realization. First, we provide a survey on microfluidic networking, including passive switching, network topologies and validation methods. Second, we propose a simple Droplet-on-Demand (DoD) system, which allows generating droplets at prescribed times and with prescribed volumes -- a crucial accomplishment in order to exploit the potential of microfluidic networks for practical purposes. We verify its functionality through experimental results. Third, we describe two promising applications for microfluidic networks, namely fast and flexible drug screening and screening of waterborne pathogens. Finally, we discuss future research opportunities and challenges.},

  abstract = {In this present work, we aim to improve the hydrophobicity of a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surface. Various heights of 3D PDMS micropillars were fabricated via grayscale photolithography, and improved wettability was investigated. Two approaches of PDMS replication were demonstrated, both using a single master mold to obtain the micropillar arrays. The different heights of fabricated PDMS micropillars were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and a surface profiler. The surface hydrophobicity was characterized by measuring the water contact angles. The fabrication of PDMS micropillar arrays was shown to be effective in modifying the contact angles of pure water droplets with the highest 157.3-degree water contact angle achieved by implementing a single mask grayscale lithography technique.},

According to the result obtained from this study, Tekala River is classified under Class I and Class II based on water quality index and National water quality standard. Two-way ANOVA showed a significant difference between parameters (ammoniacal nitrogen, BOD, pH, temperature, conductivity, DO and TDS) of sampling station. Significant difference was found between ammoniacal nitrogen, pH and temperature with sampling time. The correlation test revealed that there is relationship between Escherichia coli with ammoniacal nitrogen, temperature and DO. There is also relationship found between coliform with pH and BOD.},

Here, a label-free lateral dielectrophoresis-based microfluidic sorting platform that can digitally quantify and separate microalgae into six outlets based on the degree of their intracellular lipid content is presented. In this microfluidic system, the degree of cellular lateral displacement is inversely proportional to the intracellular lipid level, which was successfully demonstrated using               Chlamydomonas reinhardtii               cells. Using this functionality, a quick digital quantification of sub-populations that contain different intracellular lipid level in a given population was achieved. In addition, the degree of lateral displacement of microalgae could be readily controlled by simply changing the applied DEP voltage, where the level of gating in the intracellular lipid-based sorting decision could be easily adjusted. This allowed for selecting only a very small percentage of a given population that showed the highest degree of intracellular lipid content. In addition, this approach was utilized through an iterative selection process on natural and chemically mutated microalgal populations, successfully resulting in enrichment of high-lipid-accumulating microalgae. In summary, the developed platform can be exploited to quickly quantify microalgae lipid distribution in a given population in real-time and label-free, as well as to enrich a cell population with high-lipid-producing cells, or to select high-lipid-accumulating microalgal variants from a microalgal library.},

  abstract = {This paper reports the design and investigation of a digital micro magnetofluidic platform for lab-on-a-chip applications. The platform allows a ferrofluid droplet to be driven along a preprogrammed path. The platform consists of a programmable x-y-positioning stage, a permanent magnet and a glass plate coated with a thin layer of Teflon. First, the actuation of a stand-alone water-based ferrofluid droplet was investigated. Circular, rectangular, triangular and number-eight-shape trajectories were tested and analyzed. The speed of the droplet is evaluated from the position data of the black ferrofluid using a customized MATLAB program. The results show that better positioning accuracy and steady movement can be achieved with smooth trajectories. Next, the ferrofluid droplet as the driving engine for a cargo of other diamagnetic liquid droplets is demonstrated. The characteristics of different cargo volumes are investigated. Due to the liquid/liquid cohesion, a large cargo of five times the volume of a 3-{$\mu$}L ferrofluid droplet can be transported. If the cargo is larger than the driving ferrofluid droplet, the liquid system forms a long trail that faithfully follows the preprogrammed path. Various mixing experiments were carried out. The effectiveness of mixing in this system is demonstrated with a titration test as well as a chemiluminescence assay. The platform shows a robust, simple and flexible concept for implementing a complex analysis protocol with multiple reaction steps.},

  abstract = {Concentrating cells or adjusting the concentration of cells are one of the most fundamental steps in cell biology experiments, and are typically achieved through centrifugation. However this step is challenging to implement in droplet microfluidics. Here we present an in-droplet cell concentrator that operates by first gradually focusing cells inside a droplet to one side of the droplet using negative dielectrophoresis (nDEP), followed by asymmetric droplet splitting using a Y-shaped junction, resulting in two daughter droplets, one of which containing all or most of the cells. The developed platform was first characterized using droplets containing different number of polystyrene (PS) particles and by varying the applied voltages, flow rates, and the width ratios of the droplet splitting microchannels. Using this platform, the volume of one daughter droplet could be reduced up to 84\% compared to that of the mother droplet, which resulted in the PS particle concentration to increase by 5.6-fold, with an average recovery rate of 90\%. When testing with cells (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii), recovery rates as high as 98\% could be achieved while increasing the cell concentration by 5-fold. This technology adds a new capability to droplet microfluidics operation, and can be used for adjusting concentrations of cells in droplets, exchanging solutions in which cells are suspended in droplets (including cell washing steps), and separating cells of different dielectric properties inside droplets, all of which are common steps in conventional cell assays but have been so far difficult to achieve in droplet format.},

  abstract = {The global burden of foodborne diseases is substantial and foodborne pathogens are the major cause for human illnesses. In order to prevent the spread of foodborne pathogens, detection methods are constantly being updated towards rapid, portable, inexpensive, and multiplexed on-site detection. Due to the nature of the small size and low volume, microfluidics has been applied to rapid, time-saving, sensitive, and portable devices to meet the requirements of on-site detection. Simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens is another key parameter to ensure food safety. Multiplexed detection technology, including microfluidic chip design, offers a new opportunity to achieve this goal. In this review, we introduced several sample preparation and corresponding detection methods on microfluidic devices for multiplexed detection of foodborne pathogens. In the sample preparation section, methods of cell capture and enrichment, as well as nucleic acid sample preparation, were described in detail, and in the section of detection methods, amplification, immunoassay, surface plasmon resonance and impedance spectroscopy were exhaustively illustrated. The limitations and advantages of all available experimental options were also summarized and discussed in order to form a comprehensive understanding of cuttingedge technologies and provide a comparative assessment for future investigation and in-field application.},

Droplet microfluidic technology is an important branch of micro-nanofluidic technology. The microdroplet technology can produce high-throughput monodisperse droplets. The droplet technology overcomes many problems of continuous flow, such as small sample reagent volume, no cross-contamination, and rapid chemical reaction. So microdroplets have an important position in the fields of single cell analysis, gene sequencing, and real-time diagnosis. This review focuses on the different methods and applications of microdroplet generation in microfluidics. The droplet generation methods are passive and active methods. The passive method does not require external force, while the active method requires external force such as external electric field, magnetic field, acoustic field, and laser field. It is predicted that the quantitative generation of droplets on demand in microfluidics will be the important direction for future research. This review provides new ideas for the applications of the quantitative generation of microdroplets on demand in microfluidics.},

Around 75 percent of the pathogens causing these infections are of animal origin. Point-of-care tests (POCT) and point-of-need tests (PONT) have been established in order to directly provide accurate and rapid diagnostics at field level, the patient bed-side or at the site of outbreaks. These assays can help physicians and decision makers to take the right action without delay. Typically, POCT and PONT rely on genomic identification of pathogens or track their immunological fingerprint. Recently, protocols for metagenomic diagnostics in the field have been developed. In this review, we give an overview of the latest developments in portable diagnostic methods. In addition, four mobile platforms for the implementation of these techniques at point-of-care and point-of-need are described. These approaches can provide reliable diagnostics and surveillance, especially in low resource settings as well as at the level of one health.},

  abstract = {Screening of foodborne pathogens is an effective way to prevent microbial food poisoning. A microfluidic biosensor was developed for rapid and sensitive detection of Salmonella Typhimurium using quantum dots (QDs) as fluorescent probes for sensor readout and manganese dioxide nanoflowers (MnO2 NFs) and as QDs nanocarriers for signal amplification. Prior to testing, amino-modified MnO2 nanoflowers (MnO2-NH2 NFs) were conjugated with carboxyl-modified QDs through EDC/NHSS method to form MnO2-QD NFs, and MnO2-QD NFs were functionalized with polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) to form MnO2-QD-pAb NFs. First, the mixture of target Salmonella Typhimurium cells and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) modified with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was injected with MnO2-QD-pAb NFs into a microfluidic chip to form MNP-bacteria-QD-MnO2 complexes. Then, glutathione (GSH) was injected to dissolve MnO2 on the complexes into Mn2+, resulting in the release of QDs. Finally, fluorescent intensity of the released QDs was measured using the fluorescent detector to determine the amount of Salmonella. A linear relationship between fluorescent intensity and bacterial concentration from 1.0 {\texttimes} 102 to 1.0 {\texttimes} 107 CFU/mL was found with a low detection limit of 43 CFU/mL and mean recovery of 99.7\% for Salmonella in spiked chicken meats, indicating the feasibility of this biosensor for practical applications.},

  abstract = {The nepenthes-inspired lubricant-infused surface (LIS) is emerging as a novel repellent surface with self-healing, self-cleaning, pressure stability and ultra-slippery properties. Recently, stimuli-responsive materials to construct a smart LIS have broadened the application of LIS for droplet manipulation, showing great promise in microfluidics. This review mainly focuses on the recent developments towards the droplet manipulation on LIS with different mechanisms induced by various external stimuli, including thermo, light, electric, magnetism, and mechanical force. First, the droplet condition on LIS, determined by the properties of the droplet, the lubricant and substrate, is illustrated. Droplet manipulation via altering the droplet regime realized by different mechanisms, such as varying slipperiness, electrostatic force and wettability, is discussed. Moreover, some applications on droplet manipulation employed in various filed, including microreactors, microfluidics, etc., are also presented. Finally, a summary of this work and possible future research directions for the transport of droplets on smart LIS are outlined to promote the development of this field.},

They are portable devices with built-in cameras and internal microprocessors which carry out image processing. In this case, the external computers are not needed and phones can provide fast and accurate results. Moreover, the connectivity of smartphones gives the possibility to share and provide real-time results when needed, whether in health diagnostics, environmental monitoring, immunoassays or food safety. Undoubtedly, the marriage of smartphones and microfluidics has a brilliant future in building low cost and easily operable systems for analysis in the field, realizing the idea of people's ``smartlife''. The aim of this review is to present and summarize the main advantages and disadvantages of the use of smartphones as well as to take a closer look at some novel achievements published during the last couple of years. In the next paragraphs, readers will find specific uses of a combination of smartphones and microfluidics such as water analysis, health analysis (virus and bacteria detection), and measurement of physical properties or smartphone liquid control in polymer devices.},

This paper explores efforts to leverage that most compelling aspect of DEP---an actuation force that depends on particle electrical properties---in the background of phenotypic variations in cell size. Several promising approaches, centering around the application of multiple electric fields with spatially mapped magnitude and/or frequencies, are expanding the capability of DEP cell separation.},

  abstract = {The ability to selectively move and trap proteins is core to their effective use as building blocks and for their characterization. Analytical and preparative strategies for proteins have been pursued and modeled for nearly a hundred years, with great advances and success. Core to all of these studies is the separation, isolation, purification, and concentration of pure homogeneous fractions of a specific protein in solution. Processes to accomplish this useful solution include biphasic equilibrium (chromatographies, extractions), mechanical, bulk property, chemical equilibria, and molecular recognition. Ultimately, the goal of all of these is to physically remove all non-like protein molecules---to the finest detail: all atoms in the full three-dimensional structure being identical down the chemical bond and bulk structure chirality. One strategy which has not been effectively pursued is exploiting the higher order subtle electrical properties of the protein-solvent system. The advent of microfluidic systems has enabled the use of very high electric fields and welldefined gradients such that extremely high resolution separations of protein mixtures are possible. These advances and recognition of these capabilities have caused a re-evaluation of the underlying theoretical models and they were found to be inadequate. New theoretical descriptions are being considered which align more closely to the total forces present and the subtlety of differences between similar proteins. These are focused on the interfacial area between the protein and hydrating solvent molecules, as opposed to the macroscale assumptions of homogeneous solutions and particles. This critical review examines all data which has been published that place proteins in electric field gradients which induce collection of those proteins, demonstrating a force greater than dispersive effects or countering forces. Evolving theoretical constructs are presented and discussed, and a general estimate of future capabilities using the higher order effects and the high fields and precise gradients of microfluidic systems is discussed.},

  abstract = {The large-scale electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) digital microfluidic platforms always require complex electrode-addressing schemes and high-cost fabrication methods of dielectric and hydrophobic layers. Hence, the voltage polarity-dependent electrowetting was used to actuate droplets with asymmetric printed circuit board (PCB) electrodes on an open slippery liquid-infused porous surface (SLIPS) chip. The V-shaped, convex-shaped, and curve-shaped coplanar asymmetric electrode arrays were designed to achieve the directional motion of a droplet by a square wave voltage signal. The operation ranges of voltage amplitude and frequency for continuously actuating a 10 {\textmu}l droplet were obtained on the three asymmetric electrode arrays. Our results found that the curve-shaped electrode array has a broader voltage operation range than the other two for continuous pumping of a 10 {\textmu}l droplet. It is because the droplet has a long effective width of contact line with the front curve-shaped electrode and does not overlap with the rear electrode during the movement. Meanwhile, a reconfigurable convex-shaped electrode structure was also proposed to achieve bidirectional actuation of a droplet by controlling the square wave voltage. This work provides a low-cost, straightforward electrodeaddressing scheme for designing digital microfluidic devices.},

To understand the variability and to improve the biomedical requirement of a single cell, its analysis has become a key technique in biological and biomedical research. With a physical boundary of microchannels and microstructures, single cells are efficiently captured and analyzed, whereas electric forces sort and position single cells. Various microfluidic techniques have been exploited to manipulate single cells through hydrodynamic and electric forces. Digital microfluidics (DMF), the manipulation of individual droplets holding minute reagents and cells of interest by electric forces, has received more attention recently. Because of ease of fabrication, compactness and prospective automation, DMF has become a powerful approach for biological application. We review recent developments of various microfluidic chips for analysis of a single cell and for efficient genetic screening. In addition, perspectives to develop analysis of single cells based on DMF and emerging functionality with high throughput are discussed.},

The electrowetting phenomenon on modified SLIPS was investigated first, and it exhibited an up to 55{$^\circ$} contact angle difference with respect to voltage polarity while the threshold voltage was reduced to only 2 V. Then, a coplanar electrode experiment was designed to study the performance of droplet manipulation on several modified SLIPS samples with different vertically placed times and silicon oil viscosities. The optimal condition for preparing a modified SLIPS membrane is that a sample is placed vertically for 2 hours after infusing 10 cSt silicon oil, on which the droplet can be driven with the fastest velocity, and the activation voltage for moving a droplet is only 8 V. Finally, multi-droplet simultaneous and continuous manipulation on modified SLIPS in bi-direction on a loop of square electrodes was achieved. Interestingly, unlike asymmetric electrowetting, actuation methods on a solid insulator and hydrophobic layers, the droplet actuation velocity was not limited by the contact angle saturation effect and always increased with the applied voltage on modified SLIPS. This method achieves a very wide range of droplet continuous manipulation velocities from 0.075 mm s               -1               to 123 mm s               -1               under 20 V to 500 V applied voltage and the continuous droplet actuation voltage exhibits at least a 15-fold decrease compared to that of an unmodified SLIPS membrane.},

  abstract = {Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a commonly used material, serves as both a dielectric layer and a hydrophobic surface in digital microfluidics (DMF) systems. However, its low dielectric constant results in suboptimal electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) performance, limiting its application in DMF systems. In this study, a novel dielectric-hydrophobic integrated film, termed swollen composite PDMS (S-CPDMS), was developed. This film was fabricated by combining the ferroelectric polymer Poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDFTrFE)) with PDMS and enhancing surface hydrophobicity and smoothness through the application of silicone oil as a liquid lubricant. Experimental results demonstrated that the S-CPDMS film exhibits excellent hydrophobicity, high optical transparency, anti-biofouling properties, and smooth sliding performance. The effects of film composition, applied voltage frequency, and vertical placement time after silicone oil injection on its EWOD behavior were systematically investigated. The findings revealed that the S-CPDMS film achieves optimal EWOD performance when the P(VDF-TrFE) to PDMS ratio is 3:1. Furthermore, under a 1 kHz square wave alternating current (AC), the droplets on the film exhibited strong EWOD responsiveness and high reversibility. Using the SCPDMS film, a DMF device was constructed, successfully enabling droplet manipulation in both open and closed environments. Finally, glucose colorimetric reactions were successfully performed in the DMF device utilizing the S-CPDMS film. This dielectric-hydrophobic integrated film offers a simple and cost-effective solution for integrating dielectric and hydrophobic layers in DMF systems, opening new possibilities for developing lab-on-achip platforms.},

In high-income countries, the hope is to streamline the diagnostic procedure, minimize costs and make healthcare processes more efficient and faster, which, in some cases, can be more a matter of convenience than necessity. However, in resource-limited settings such as low-income countries, PoC-diagnostics might be the only viable route, when the next laboratory is hours away. Therefore, it is especially important to focus research into novel diagnostics for these countries in order to alleviate suffering due to infectious disease. In this review, the current research describing the use of PoC diagnostics in resource-limited settings and the potential bottlenecks along the value chain that prevent their widespread application is summarized. To this end, we will look at literature that investigates different parts of the value chain, such as fundamental research and market economics, as well as actual use at healthcare providers. We aim to create an integrated picture of potential PoC barriers, from the first start of research at universities to patient treatment in the field. Results from the literature will be discussed with the aim to bring all important steps and aspects together in order to illustrate how effectively PoC is being used in low-income countries. In addition, we discuss what is needed to improve the situation further, in order to use this technology to its fullest advantage and avoid ``leaks in the pipeline'', when a promising device fails to take the next step of the valorization pathway and is abandoned.},

  abstract = {Due to the block of the lubricant on liquid-infused surfaces (LISs), the molecular processes near the liquid-liquid interface and the shape of droplet under electrowetting actuation are still difficult to observe with simple optical methods. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation provides a visual method for observing the nanodroplet morphology on the LISs. In this paper, the impacts of the substrate characteristics and the lubricant thickness on the cloaking state, the wetting state and the diffusion diameter of nanodroplet were studied by the MD simulation. It is found the coating film of the nanodroplet increases with the lubricant layer thickness on the LISs of silicon nanopillar substrate, while the nanodroplet is always in the not cloaking state on the LISs of copper nanopillar substrate, even with a very thick lubricant layer. Subsequently, the electrowetting behaviors of the nanodroplet under the external electric field in the parallel and perpendicular directions to the surface were studied. The results indicate the droplet changes from the Cassie state to the partial Wenzel state under the influence of the external electric field on the LISs of both substrates. Meanwhile, the coating film thickness increases with the electric field intensity, the nanodroplet changes from a not cloaking state to a cloaking state on the LISs of copper substrate, while still is in a not cloaking state on the LISs of silicon substrate. Compared to the LISs of the silicon substrate, the electro-stretching is easier to happen on the LISs of the copper substrate. Finally, the impact of lubricant layer thickness on the nanodroplet electrowetting was studied on both copper and silicon substrates. It is found the reduction of nanodroplet apparent contact angle increases with the lubricant layer thickness under an external parallel electric field, while it has a maximum on the moderate lubricant thickness under an external electric field in a perpendicular upward or downward direction. Our results indicate the droplet deformation on LISs under the external electric field is contributed to the competition of the electrowetting, the electro-stretching, and the pinning effect.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The combination of ammonia fuel and proton-conducting fuel cells (PCFCs) technology may provide an ideal clean energy system for the future, considering matured NH               3               synthesis technology and transportation and storage infrastructure, the high energy density of NH               3               , and the high efficiency of fuel cells. However, poor catalytic activity of the anode for NH               3               decomposition, quick performance degradation due to the ammonia induced nickel coarsening, difficult sintering, and insufficient proton conductivity of electrolytes are the main challenges for stable and high-power generation from ammonia-fueled PCFCs. Herein, a new Ba(Zr               0.1               Ce               0.7               Y               0.1               Yb               0.1               )               0.95               Pd               0.05               O               3-                                {$\delta$}                              perovskite is reported as a key anode component and electrolyte, which demonstrates multifunctionalities and tackles most challenges of conventional PCFCs. The incorporation of a small amount of Pd boosts catalytic activity of the nickel-perovskite cermet anode for NH               3               decomposition and increases proton conductivity from the creation of B-site cation deficiency and electrolyte sintering. The corresponding thin-film electrolyte PCFC delivers a maximum power density of 724~mW cm               --2               at 650~{$^\circ$}C operated on NH               3               , much higher than the similar cell without Pd incorporation (450~mW cm               --2               ). Furthermore, no apparent performance decay is observed for the cell operated at 550~{$^\circ$}C in H               2               and NH               3               for 350 h, making it highly promising for practical applications.},

  abstract = {Droplet-based microfluidic screening techniques can benefit from interfacing established microtiter plate-based screening and sample management workflows. Interfacing tools are required both for loading preconfigured microtiter-plate (MTP)-based sample collections into droplets and for dispensing the used droplets samples back into MTPs for subsequent storage or further processing. Here, we present a collection of Digital Microfluidic Pipetting Tips (DMPTs) with integrated facilities for droplet generation and manipulation together with a robotic system for its operation. This combination serves as a bidirectional sampling interface for sample transfer from wells into droplets (w2d) and vice versa droplets into wells (d2w). The DMPT were designed to fit into 96-deep-well MTPs and prepared from glass by means of microsystems technology. The aspirated samples are converted into the channel-confined droplets' sequences separated by an immiscible carrier medium. To comply with the demands of dose-response assays, up to three additional assay compound solutions can be added to the sample droplets. To enable different procedural assay protocols, four different DMPT variants were made. In this way, droplet series with gradually changing composition can be generated for, e.g., 2D screening purposes. The developed DMPT and their common fluidic connector are described here. To handle the opposite transfer d2w, a robotic transfer system was set up and is described briefly.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) allows rapid movement of liquid droplets on a smooth surface, with applications ranging from lab-on-chip devices to microactuators. The in-plane force on a droplet is a key indicator of EWOD performance. This force has been extensively modeled but few direct experimental measurements are reported. We study the EWOD force on a droplet using two setups that allow, for the first time, the simultaneous measurement of force and contact angle, while imaging the droplet shape at 6000 frames/s. For several liquids and surfaces, we observe that the force saturates at a voltage of approximately 150 V. Application of voltages of up 2 kV, that is, 10 times higher than is typical, does not significantly increase forces beyond the saturation point. However, we observe that the transient dynamics, localized at the front contact line, do not show saturation with voltage. At the higher voltages, the initial front contact line speed continues to increase, the front contact angle temporarily becomes near zero, creating a thin liquid film, and capillary waves form at the liquid--air interface. When the localized EWOD forces at the contact line exceed the capillary forces, projectile droplets form. Increasing surface tension allows for higher droplet forces, which we demonstrate with mercury.},

  abstract = {Microfluidics-based digital PCR (dPCR) is a potent technique capable of absolute quantification of nucleic acids with ultrahigh sensitivity. However, an indispensable process, nucleic acid extraction (NAE) remains hard to be integrated with dPCR into a monolithic device, because both of them involve complicated processes and exquisite fluid manipulation. An ideal solution to this issue is to integrate the two main microfluidic platforms, channel-based microfluidics (CMF) and digital microfluidics (DMF), which, however, remains very challenging. To address these challenges, we herein develop a photofabricated channel-digital microfluidic chip (pCDMF) with significant advantages including: the fabrication of pCDMF is very convenient due to the flexible material choices of photocuring, without tedious process of hydrophobic coating; a parallel-plate configuration can be easily formed, enabling all basic functions of DMF; various channels and microstructures can be freely designed, allowing for fluidic functions of CMF. It is therefore the first example of full integration of DMF and CMF as a monolithic device, with capabilities to precisely handle both discrete droplets and continuous fluids. Finally, an all-in-one device for sample-to-answer digital PCR has been successfully demonstrated. We also envisioned that the pCDMF may open an alternative route toward the fully integrated lab-on-a-chip for various biological applications.},

Existing methods still struggle to balance the droplet generation performance with system simplicity. Here we introduce a novel droplet generation scheme based on the acoustic streaming generated from a vibrating sharptip capillary. The unique fluid pattern enables efficient droplet generation without any external pressure sources. This method achieved real-time modulation of droplet size over an ultra-wide range (6.77--661 {$\mu$}m), high throughput (up to 5000 droplets/s), and good monodispersity ({$<$}4\%) with a power consumption below 60 mW. This method has enabled a multi-volume digital PCR with a dynamic range of {\textasciitilde}6 orders of magnitude and multiplexing capability. It has also enabled a simple protocol to produce cell-laden alginate microcapsules in variable sizes with excellent biocompatibility. Overall, the present method combines high performance with small footprint and portability, which will be especially valuable for droplet applications requiring variable droplet size and performed in resource-limited settings.},

Typhimurium) detection in microfluidic channels using positive dielectrophoresis (pDEP) driven on-line enrichment and fluorescent nanoparticles label. In the protocol, S. Typhimurium was first incubated with the anti-S. Typhimurium antibody conjugated RuBpy-doped fluorescent nanoparticles (AbS. Typhimurium-FNPs). After incubation, the reacted mixture of S. Typhimurium and AbS. TyphimuriumFNPs bioconjugates was directly introduced into the pDEP-based microfluidic system. On applying an AC voltage to the electrodes in a pDEP frequency region, the FNPs labeled S. Typhimurium cells moved to the electrodes and accumulated in the electrode gap, while the free AbS. Typhimurium-FNPs were flowed away. The enriched FNPs labeled S. Typhimurium were detected by fluorescence microscopy at the focused detection areas. This new method constructed a simultaneous on-line enrichment and detection platform, eliminated the separation and washing-out steps usually required for FNPs label involved bioassay. Utilizing signal amplification effects produced by pDEP on-line enrichment and FNPs label, the detection limit for S. Typhimurium in deionized water is 56 colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/mL). We applied the established approach to detecting artificially contaminated bottled mineral water samples; S. Typhimurium of 110 cfu/mL was accurately detected. It is believed that the proposed method will find wide applications in biomedicine fields demanding higher sensitive bacterial identification.},

  abstract = {Magnetic solid phase substrates for biomolecule manipulation have become a valuable tool for simplification and automation of molecular biology protocols. However, the handling of magnetic particles inside microfluidic chips for miniaturized assays is often challenging due to inefficient mixing, aggregation, and the advanced instrumentation required for effective actuation. Here, we describe the use of a microfluidic magnetic fluidized bed approach that enables dynamic, highly efficient and simplified magnetic bead actuation for DNA analysis in a continuous flow platform with minimal technical requirements. We evaluate the performance of this approach by testing the efficiency of individual steps of a DNA assay based on padlock probes and rolling circle amplification. This assay comprises common nucleic acid analysis principles, such as hybridization, ligation, amplification and restriction digestion. We obtained efficiencies of up to 90\% for these reactions with high throughput processing up to 120 {$\mu$}L of DNA dilution at flow rates ranging from 1 to 5 {$\mu$}L/min without compromising performance. The fluidized bed was 20--50\% more efficient than a commercially available solution for microfluidic manipulation of magnetic beads. Moreover, to demonstrate the potential of this approach for integration into micro-total analysis systems, we optimized the production of a low-cost polymer based microarray and tested its analytical performance for integrated single-molecule digital read-out. Finally, we provide the proof-of-concept for a single-chamber microfluidic chip that combines the fluidized bed with the polymer microarray for a highly simplified and integrated magnetic bead-based DNA analyzer, with potential applications in diagnostics.},

  abstract = {Lab on a Chip (LOC) devices minimize, integrate, automate, and parallelize laboratory functions such as mixing, separation, and incubation on a single chip. Droplet generation is one key aspect in LOC devices which allows to conduct various chemical and biochemical assays enabling biological cell studies, high throughput drug development, and diagnostic screenings. This paper presents, modelling, simulation, and experimentation of an active droplet generator that is widely used in LOC devices. The model geometry used in this study was based on a flow focusing method of droplet generation. Droplet generation from the numerical simulations was observed within flow rate ratios ranging from 0.2 to 4 using optimised droplet contraction width of the generator model. Subsequently, a prototype droplet generator was designed and developed from Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) material using a layer-based fabrication method. Based on the experimental setup presented here, the calculated ratios of flow rates obtained for different voltage values have shown that the formation of droplets occur between flow rate ratios of 1.04 and 4.74. In addition, morphological parameters of the droplet images extracted from a digital image processing algorithm show that the mean diameter of the droplets decreases with decreasing flow rate ratios.},

  abstract = {A nonionic particle placed in the gradient of an electric field experiences the dielectrophoretic force which scales linearly with the gradient of the electric field squared. The proportionality constant is the dielectrophoretic susceptibility, that is, a linear transport coefficient. For proteins in solution, it is mostly affected by the following two parameters: the squared dipole moment and the cavity susceptibility accounting for cross-correlations of the protein dipole with the hydration shell (protein-water Kirkwood factor). Both of these parameters enter the dielectric increment of the solution which fully specifies the dielectrophoretic susceptibility. The link between these two measurable properties is proven here to hold using molecular dynamics simulations of solvated proteins. The dielectrophoretic susceptibility for proteins is in the range of 104, significantly exceeding traditional estimates limiting it to values below unity. Part of this large magnitude of the dielectrophoretic response is the cavity susceptibility of the protein-water interface, which significantly exceeds dielectric estimates. The study analyzes local fields inside the protein in terms of the reaction-field and directingfield components. We find that the local field exceeds the external field by a substantial factor described by the local field susceptibility. The electric field produced by water inside the protein is retarded by 3-4 orders of magnitude compared to the bulk.},

  abstract = {Digital (droplet-based) microfluidic systems apply electromagnetic characteristics as the fundamental fluid actuation mechanism. These systems are often implemented in two-dimensional architectures, overcoming one-dimensional continuous flow channel practical issues. The fundamental operation for digital microfluidics requires the creation of an electric field distribution to achieve desired fluid actuation. The electric field distribution is typically non-uniform, enabling creation of net dielectrophoresis (DEP) force. The DEP force magnitude is proportional to the difference between microdroplet and surrounding medium complex dielectric constants, and the gradient of the electric field magnitude squared. Force sign/direction can be manipulated to achieve a force towards higher (positive DEP) or lower (negative DEP) electrostatic energy by tailoring the relative difference between microdroplet and surrounding medium complex dielectric constants through careful selection of the devices fabrication materials. The DEP force magnitudes and directions are applied here for well-controlled and high-speed microdroplet actuation. Control and speed characteristics arise from significant differences in the microdroplet/medium conductivity and the use of a micropin architecture with strong electric field gradients. The implementation, referred to here as a DEP microjet, establishes especially strong axial propulsion forces. Single- and double-micropin topologies achieve strong axial propulsion force, but only the double-micropin topology creates transverse converging forces for stable and controlled microdroplet actuation. Electric field distributions for each topology are investigated and linked to axial and transverse forces. Experimental results are presented for both topologies. The double-micropin topology is tested with biological fluids. Microdroplet actuation speeds up to 25 cm/s are achieved---comparable to the fastest speeds to-date.},

Several different electrode patterns were tested under the same conditions. The results indicate that condensation on a cooled flat surface was increased using electrowetting (EW) by accelerating the slow coalescence process where smaller droplets join to form larger droplets and leave behind a dry surface for new droplets to form. A pattern consisting of 100-lm wide interdigitated electrodes separated by 100-lm gaps showed the fastest growth in droplet size. The largest droplets formed with such a pattern had approximately 30 times larger volume than the largest droplets formed on the surface when electrowetting was not applied. Finer patterns exhibited a larger overall condensation rate, where the electrowetting method showed up to a 56\% increase in overall water condensation.},

  abstract = {As in many low- and middle-income countries around the world, thousands of local communities in Southeast Asia rely on river water to sustain their livelihoods. However, poor water quality threatens the health of both humans and ecosystems. The aim of this review was to examine the available literature to investigate how health outcomes in Malaysia have been studied and reported as directly attributable to human infections from river water. Computer-aided searches from 10 electronic databases were undertaken, with searches limited to the English language and publication dates since January 2010. The literature search revealed that the predominant river water infections identified in Malaysia were bacterial (coliforms, Salmonella spp., typhoid, leptospirosis, melioidosis), viral (including dengue, hepatitis, enterovirus), parasitic infections including amoebiasis, giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis, helminth infections, Blastocystis infections and sarcocystosis. No studies were found that have attempted to evaluate the impact of water related infection on human health longitudinally. Moreover, the possibility of integrated water governance systems that could reduce infection and improve water quality, particularly for marginalized groups have not been discussed or studied. Several cross-sectional studies identified infections at a point in time, but large longitudinal data sets of water infection parameters and how they influence human health outcomes have not been reported. Using Malaysia as a demonstration case study, we suggest a number of recommendations based on using a systems approach to tackle the challenges involved in data collection and integration, which is central to the understanding, strategic planning and management of water-borne infections.},

These systems are categorized as surface tension driven or contact line driven. Surface tension driven systems include electrowetting on dielectric, Marangoni flow on microheater arrays, and chemical gradient surfaces, whereas contact line driven systems include anisotropic ratchet conveyors, nanostructured Parylene ratchets, and tilted pillar arrays. This article describes the operating principles and outlines the fabrication procedures for each system. We also present new equations that unify several previous models of contact line driven systems. The strengths and weaknesses of each system are compared, with a focus on their ability to perform the generation, switching, fusion, and fission of droplets. Finally, we discuss current and potential future applications of these systems.},

  abstract = {The dielectrophoresis (DEP) data reported in the literature since 1994 for 22 different globular proteins is examined in detail. Apart from three cases, all of the reported protein DEP experiments employed a gradient field factor ∇E2m that is much smaller (in some instances by many orders of magnitude) than the {\textasciitilde}4 {\texttimes} 1021 V2/m3 required, according to current DEP theory, to overcome the dispersive forces associated with Brownian motion. This failing results from the macroscopic Clausius--Mossotti (CM) factor being restricted to the range 1.0 {$>$} CM {$>$} -0.5. Current DEP theory precludes the protein's permanent dipole moment (rather than the induced moment) from contributing to the DEP force. Based on the magnitude of the {$\beta$}-dispersion exhibited by globular proteins in the frequency range 1 kHz--50 MHz, an empirically derived molecular version of CM is obtained. This factor varies greatly in magnitude from protein to protein (e.g., {\textasciitilde}37,000 for carboxypeptidase; {\textasciitilde}190 for phospholipase) and when incorporated into the basic expression for the DEP force brings most of the reported protein DEP above the minimum required to overcome dispersive Brownian thermal effects. We believe this empirically-derived finding validates the theories currently being advanced by Matyushov and co-workers.},

The time-averaged effective electrical wetting tension, which is a function of AC frequency, is computed by integrating the Maxwell stress. The computed wetting tension is compared with the experimental result converted from the separately obtained contact-angle data. There is a good agreement between the two results at a low-frequency range and a qualitative agreement at a high-frequency range. Interestingly, the numerical results show that the electric-field strength decreases remarkably in the insulating layer near the TCL as the AC frequency increases. This decrease may account for the delay of the dielectric breakdown of an insulating layer in the AC case, which could be related to the contact-angle saturation phenomenon.},

As one of the frontend operations on digital microfluidic biochips, sample preparation plays an important role in biochemical assays and applications. For fast and high-throughput biochemical applications, it is critical to develop an automated design methodology for sample preparation. Prior work in this area does not provide solutions to the problem of design automation for sample preparation. Moreover, it is critical to ensure the correctness of droplets and recover from errors efficiently during sample preparation. Published work on error recovery is inefficient and impractical for sample preparation. Therefore, in this paper, we present an automated design methodology for sample preparation, including architectural synthesis, layout synthesis, and dynamic error recovery. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on real-life biochemical applications to demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency. Compared to prior work, the proposed algorithm can achieve up to 48.39\% reduction in sample preparation time.},

This paper proposes a dilution/mixing method with high utilization of intermediate droplets for preparing biochemical samples of multiple target concentrations on DMFBs. It provides the first solution to the problem of generating samples of multiple target concentrations. Unlike prior work in which the preparation of droplets of multiple target concentrations has to be carried out sequentially, this proposed approach takes a global view and all the target concentrations are processed concurrently. In addition, this is also the first approach that minimizes the number of waste droplets by utilizing intermediate droplets. Finally, the number of mixing steps can be reduced, leading to reduced completion time for sample preparation. The number of waste droplets is minimized by reducing the number of intermediate concentrations produced during sample preparation. Usable intermediate droplets are subsequently utilized to further reduce wastage. Simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve up to 71\% reduction in the number of waste droplets and up to 50\% reduction in sample preparation time.},

According to the recent market report, the growth of biochips market is twice than before. However, as the enormous business opportunities grow, piracy attacks, which are exploited by unscrupulous people to gain illegal profits, become a severe threat to DMFBs. To prevent piracy attacks, the conventional approach uses secret keys to perform authentication. Nevertheless, DMFBs only consist of electrodes to control the operations of droplets, and there are no memories and logic gates integrated on it to store secret keys. This makes designing secure defenses of DMFBs against piracy attacks more difficult. Thus, in this paper, we propose the first authentication method for piracy prevention of DMFBs based on a novel Physical Unclonable Function (PUF). The proposed PUF utilizes the inherent variation of electrodes on DMFBs to generate secret keys, so it does not require memory. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed PUF. Finally, we analyze the security of the proposed method against piracy attacks.},

  abstract = {In a biomedical diagnosis with a limited sample volume and low concentration, dropletbased microfluidics, also called digital microfluidics, becomes a very attractive approach. Previously, our group developed a magnetic-beads-based digital microfluidic immunoassay with a bead number of around 100, requiring less than 1 {\textmu}L of sample volume to achieve a pg/mL level limit of detection (LOD). However, the bead number in each measurement was not the same, causing an unstable coefficient of variation (CV) in the calibration curve. Here, we investigated whether a fixed number of beads in this bead-based digital microfluidic immunoassay could provide more stable results. First, the bead screening chips were developed to extract exactly 100, 49, and 25 magnetic beads with diameters of less than 6 {\textmu}m. Then, four calibration curves were established. One calibration curve was constructed by using varying bead numbers (50--160) in the process. The other three calibration curves used a fixed number of beads, (100, 49, and 25). The results indicated that the CVs for a fixed number of beads were evidently smaller than the CVs for varying bead numbers, especially in the range of 1 pg/mL to 100 pg/mL, where the CVs for 100 beads were less than 10\%. Furthermore, the calculated LOD, based on the composite calibration curves, could be reduced by three orders, from 3.0 pg/mL (for the unfixed bead number) to 0.0287 pg/mL (for 100 beads). However, when the bead numbers were too high (more than 500) or too low (25 or fewer), the bead manipulation for aggregation became more difficult in the magnetic-beads-based digital microfluidic immunoassay chip.},

  abstract = {In this study, an ``all-in-one'' digital microfluidics (DMF) system was developed for automatic and rapid molecular diagnosis and integrated with magnetic bead-based nucleic acid extraction, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), and real-time optical signal monitoring. First, we performed on- and off-chip comparison experiments for the magnetic bead nucleic acid extraction module and LAMP amplification function. The extraction efficiency for the on-chip test was comparable to that of conventional off-chip methods. The processing time for the automatic on-chip workflow was only 23 min, which was less than that of the conventional methods of 28 min 45 s. Meanwhile, the number of samples used in on-chip experiments was significantly smaller than that used in off-chip experiments; only 5 {\textmu}L of E. coli samples was required for nucleic acid extraction, and 1 {\textmu}L of the nucleic acid template was needed for the amplification reaction. In addition, we selected SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid reference materials for the nucleic acid detection experiment, demonstrating a limit of detection of 10 copies/{\textmu}L. The proposed ``all-in-one'' DMF system provides an on-site ``sample to answer'' time of approximately 60 min, which can be a powerful tool for point-of-care molecular diagnostics.},

  abstract = {This paper details the development of a digital microfluidic platform for multiplexed real-time polymerase chain reactions. Liquid samples in discrete droplet format are programmably manipulated upon an electrode array by the use of electrowetting. Rapid PCR thermocycling is performed in a closed-loop flow-through format where for each cycle the reaction droplets are cyclically transported between different temperature zones within an oil-filled cartridge. The cartridge is fabricated using low-cost printed-circuit-board technology and is intended to be a single-use disposable device. The PCR system exhibited remarkable amplification efficiency of 94.7\%. To test its potential application in infectious diseases, this novel PCR system reliably detected diagnostic DNA levels of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Candida albicans. Amplification of genomic DNA samples was consistently repeatable across multiple PCR loops both within and between cartridges. In addition, simultaneous real-time PCR amplification of both multiple different samples and multiple different targets on a single cartridge was demonstrated. A novel method of PCR speed optimization using variable cycle times has also been proposed and proven feasible. The versatile system includes magnetic bead handling capability, which was applied to the analysis of simulated clinical samples that were prepared from whole blood using a magnetic bead capture protocol. Other salient features of this versatile digital microfluidic PCR system are also discussed, including the configurability and scalability of microfluidic operations, instrument portability and substrate-level integration with other pre- and post-PCR processes.},

  abstract = {Recently, digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) have revolutionized many biochemical laboratory procedures and received much attention due to their advantages such as high throughput, automatic control, and low cost. To meet the challenges of increasing design complexity, computer-aided-design (CAD) tools have been involved to build DMFBs efficiently, where a two-stage design flow of fluidic-level synthesis followed by chip-level design are generally applied. Regarding fluidic-level synthesis, many related studies and CAD tools have been welldeveloped to synthesize the fluidic behaviors efficiently and effectively. However, research findings being highly-concerned with the chip-level design are still critically lacking. In this paper, we shall focus on chiplevel design and discuss related background and two major optimization problems posed by electrode addressing and control pin routing. We show how CAD tools are involved to automate and optimize the two design problems. With this assistance, users can concentrate on the development and abstraction of nanoscale bioassays while leaving chip optimization and implementation details to CAD tools.},

  abstract = {Recent advances of digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) have revolutionized the traditional laboratory procedures. By providing the droplet-based system, DMFB can perform real-time biological analysis and safety-critical biomedical applications. However, different droplets being transported and manipulated on the DMFB may introduce the contamination problem caused by liquid residue between different biomolecules. To overcome this problem, a wash droplet is introduced to clean the contaminations on the surface of the microfluidic array. However, current scheduling of wash droplet does not restrict the extra used cells and execution time of bioassay, thereby degrading the reliability and fault-tolerance significantly. In this paper, we propose a contamination aware droplet routing algorithm for DMFBs. To reduce the routing complexity and the used cells, we first construct preferred routing tracks by analyzing the global moving vector of droplets to guide the droplet routing. To cope with contaminations within one subproblem, we first apply a kshortest path routing technique to minimize the contaminated spots. Then, to take advantage of multiple wash droplets, we adopt a minimum cost circulation (MCC) algorithm for optimal wash-droplet routing to simultaneously minimize used cells and the cleaning time. Since the droplet routing problem consists of several subproblems, a look-ahead prediction technique is further used to determine the contaminations between successive subproblems. After that, we can simultaneously clean both contaminations within one subproblem and those between successive subproblems by using the MCC-based algorithm to reduce the execution time and the used cells significantly. Based on four widely used bioassays, our algorithm reduces the used cells and the execution time significantly compared with the state-of-theart algorithm.},

  abstract = {The microfluidic technology for function microsphere synthesis has high control precision. However, the throughput is too low for industrial scale-up applications. Current scale-up design focuses on a multi-channel in 2D, in which the distribution uniformity parameter {$\delta$} increases linearly, resulting in the deterioration of the flow distribution performance. The 3D modular scale-up strategy could greatly alleviate this problem, but no design principles have been developed yet. For the first time, this paper establishes the microfluidic 3D scale-up design criteria. Based on the modular design concept, the design method of 2D and 3D throughput scale-up parameters N and M, distribution uniformity parameters {$\delta$} and {$\beta$}, and microchannel design parameter KR were proposed. The equivalent resistance coefficient was defined, and the influence of different parameters on a 2D array and 3D stack was analyzed. Furthermore, the error correction method was studied. It was found that the twostage scale-up process contradicted each other. A good scale-up performance of one stage led to the limitation of another stage. Increasing the resistance of each channel Ru could both increase the two-stage scale-up performance, which was an important factor. A single-module scale-up system with 8 channels in a single array and 10 arrays in a vertical stack, which had 80 channels in total, was designed and fabricated based on the proposed design criteria for generating Chitosan/TiO2 composite microspheres. The average particle size was 539.65 {\textmu}m and CV value was about 3.59\%. The throughput was 480 ml h-1, which effectively increased the throughput scale and the product quality.},

  abstract = {Monitoring low levels of ammonia in chloraminated water can be challenging but is important for effectively managing potable water disinfection. The lower the concentration of free ammonia that can be determined, the tighter the control at the disinfection point, which supports better maintenance of chloramine residuals in the distribution system. In this study a micro-distillation technique was used to selectively separate ammonia into a boric acid solution allowing determination by conductance (i.e., micro-distillation and conductance measurement instrument - Micro-DCMI). The optimised technique had a linear calibration range of 0.01--60 mg NH3 L-1 with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.014 mg L-1 and limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.045 mg L-1. With the optimum operational parameters of 80 {$^\circ$}C distillation temperature, 0.3 L min-1 air flow rate, 0.1 mol L-1 boric acid concentration and 8 min pre-concentration time, a sample throughput of 7 samples per hour was achieved. A laboratory comparison between Micro-DCMI and the standard ammonia selective electrode method was conducted on water samples obtained from a chloraminated drinking water distribution system. The results showed that the ratios of the free ammonia values determined by Micro-DCMI and an ammonia selective electrode were between 0.82 and 1.2 for 11 water samples. A custom-built automated analytical system was evaluated at a water treatment plant in Australia and the results compared favourably with the in plant online ammonia ion selective analyser. This study indicated that the Micro-DCMI method was a simple, robust and low cost online monitoring system suitable for determining low concentration ammonia to manage chloramination.},

  abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has spread worldwide and caused more than six million deaths globally. Therefore, a timely and accurate diagnosis method is of pivotal importance for controlling the dissemination and expansions. Nucleic acid detection by the reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method generally requires centralized diagnosis laboratories and skilled operators, significantly restricting its use in rural areas and field settings. The digital microfluidic (DMF) technique provides a better option for simultaneous detections of multiple pathogens with fewer specimens and easy operation. In this study, we developed a novel digital microfluidic RT-qPCR platform for multiple detections of respiratory pathogens. This method can simultaneously detect eleven respiratory pathogens, namely, mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP), chlamydophila pneumoniae (CP), streptococcus pneumoniae (SP), human respiratory syncytial virus A (RSVA), human adenovirus (ADV), human coronavirus (HKU1), human coronavirus 229E (HCoV229E), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2), influenza A virus (FLUA) and influenza B virus (FLUB). The diagnostic performance was evaluated using positive plasmids samples and clinical specimens compared with off-chip individual RT-PCR testing. The results showed that the limit of detections was around 12 to 150 copies per test. The true positive rate, true negative rate, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of DMF on-chip method were 93.33\%, 100\%, 100\%, 99.56\%, and 99.85\%, respectively, as validated by the off-chip RT-qPCR counterpart. Collectively, this study reported a cost-effective, high sensitivity and specificity on-chip DMF RT-qPCR system for detecting multiple respiratory pathogens, which will greatly contribute to timely and effective clinical management of respiratory infections in medical resource-limited settings.},

  abstract = {A prototype aerosol detection system is presented that is designed to accurately and quickly measure the concentration of selected inorganic ions in the atmosphere. The aerosol detection system combines digital microfluidics technology, aerosol impaction and chemical detection integrated on the same chip. Target compounds are the major inorganic aerosol constituents: sulfate, nitrate and ammonium. The digital microfluidic system consists of top and bottom plates that sandwich a fluid layer. Nozzles for an inertial impactor are built into the top plate according to known, scaling principles. The deposited air particles are densely concentrated in well-defined deposits on the bottom plate containing droplet actuation electrodes of the chip in fixed areas. The aerosol collection efficiency for particles larger than 100 nm in diameter was higher than 95\%. After a collection phase, deposits are dissolved into a scanning droplet. Due to a sub-microliter droplet size, the obtained extract is highly concentrated. Droplets then pass through an air/oil interface on chip for colorimetric analysis by spectrophotometry using optical fibers placed between the two plates of the chip. To create a standard curve for each analyte, six different concentrations of liquid standards were chosen for each assay and dispensed from on-chip reservoirs. The droplet mixing was completed in a few seconds and the final droplet was transported to the detection position as soon as the mixing was finished. Limits of detection (LOD) in the final droplet were determined to be 11 ppm for sulfate and 0.26 ppm for ammonium. For nitrate, it was impossible to get stable measurements. The LOD of the on-chip measurements for sulfate was close to that obtained by an off-chip method using a Tecan spectrometer. LOD of the on-chip method for ammonium was about five times larger than what was obtained with the off-chip method. For the current impactor collection air flow (1 L/min) and 1 h collection time, the converted LODs in air were: 0.275 {\textmu}g/m3 for sulfate, 6.5 ng/m3 for ammonium, sufficient for most ambient air monitoring applications.},

In this paper, we reviewed droplet detection and active sorting methods that are currently still being widely used for high-through screening applications in microfluidic systems, including the latest updates regarding each technology. We analyze and summarize the merits and drawbacks of each presented technology and conclude, with our perspectives, on future direction of development.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) have been widely used in biochemical experiments with high safety requirements. To ensure the reliability of the experiment, it is necessary to use test droplets to perform off-line and on-line testing for DMFBs. Previous random search algorithms are not fully combined with heuristic information, which increases the randomness of search progress and thus results in suboptimal test paths. To solve this problem, a new test path optimization method based on priority strategy and genetic algorithm is proposed, which reduces the blindness of test path search and improves the convergence effect of the random search algorithm. In this method, priority levels are randomly assigned to the edges of the chip test model. With the fluid constraints, a test droplet moves to the untraversed adjacent edge with the highest priority. If all adjacent edges have been traversed, Floyd algorithm is used to determine the shortest path from the test droplet to untraversed edges, and guide the test droplet to move along the shortest path. After determining the test path according to priority strategy, the priority level on the test path is optimized by genetic algorithm, so that the length of the path is gradually reduced by iteration. In this paper, a single test droplet is used to test given chips. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient, and the shortest path length is equal to the length of the Euler path, indicating that the shortest test path has reached the optimal value. Moreover, for the ``deadlock'' problem of droplets in on-line testing process, we also provide a solution by using backoff operation.},

  abstract = {As the microfluidic technology advances, the design complexity of digital microfluidic biochips (DMFB) are expected to explode in the near future. One of the most critical challenges for DMFB design is the droplet routing problem, which schedules the movement of each droplet in a time-multiplexed manner. In this paper, we propose a fast routability- and performancedriven droplet router for DMFBs. The main contributions of our work are: (1) a global moving vector analysis for constructing preferred routing tracks to minimize the number of used unit cells; (2) an entropy-based equation to determine the routing order of droplets for better routability; (3) a routing compaction technique by dynamic programming to minimize the latest arrival time of droplets. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves 100\% routing completion for all test cases on three Benchmark Suites while the previous algorithms are not. In addition to routability, compared with the state-of-theart high-performance routing on the Benchmark Suite I [3], the experimental results still show that our algorithm performed better in runtime by 40\%, reduced the latest arrival time by 21\%, reduced the used unit cells by 10\%. Furthermore, experiment results on Benchmark Suite II and III are also very promising. Based on the evaluation of three Benchmark Suites, our algorithm demonstrates the efficiency and robustness of handling complex droplet routing problem over the existing algorithms.},

  abstract = {Microfluidics, as one of the most valuable analytical technologies of this century, has played an important role in various fields. Particularly, out-of-channel microfluidics, often referred to as open microfluidics (OMF) has recently drawn wide research attention among scholars for its great potential in convenient manual intervention. Much recent research has been geared toward bare droplets and particle-armed droplets (namely liquid marbles, LMs), which could serve as independent systems in OMF. Their versatile applications include but are not limited to nanomaterials preparation, energy harvesting, cell culture and environment monitoring. These applications are mainly attributed to the excellent independence, low reagent consumption and short reaction time of separate droplets and LMs. In addition, more operation features, such as diverse handling options, flexible controllability and high precision, further enable droplets and LMs carrying small liquid biochemical samples to be manipulated in an open environment freely. Considering the emergence of important research on bare droplets and LMs, this paper systematically reviews the state of the art in the fundamentals and manipulation of the two novel platforms under the frame of OMF. First, the intrinsic property of bare droplets on solid substrates, especially on superhydrophobic ones, is discussed, followed by the formation mechanism of nonwetting LMs and the effect of coating particles on LMs' performance. Then, friction obstacles and actuation principles raised in driving droplets and LMs are further analyzed theoretically. Subsequently, several classical types of manipulation tasks for both droplets and LMs, namely transportation, coalescence, mixing and splitting, are discussed with a focus on key techniques to accomplish the tasks aforementioned. Finally, the fundamental and manipulation similarities and differences between bare droplets and LMs are summarized and future developments towards droplet- or LM-based microreactors and microsensors are recommended accordingly.},

  abstract = {Recently, digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) have revolutionized many biochemical laboratory procedures and received much attention due to many advantages such as high throughput, automatic control, and low cost. To meet the challenges of increasing design complexity, computer-aideddesign (CAD) tools have been involved to build DMFBs efficiently. Current CAD tools generally conduct a twostage based design flow of fluidic-level synthesis followed by chip-level design to optimize fluidic behaviors and chip architecture separately. Nevertheless, existing fluidic-chip design gap will become even wider with a rapid escalation in the number of assay operations incorporated into a single DMFB. As more and more large-scale assay protocols are delivered in current emerging marketplace, this problem may potentially restrict the effectiveness and feasibility of the entire DMFB realization and thus needs to be solved quickly. In this paper, we propose the first fluidicchip co-design methodology for DMFBs to effectively bridge the fluidic-chip design gap. Our work provides a comprehensive integration throughout fluidic-operation scheduling, chip layout generation, control pin assignment, and wiring solution to achieve higher design performance and feasibility. Experimental results show the effectiveness, robustness, and scalability of our co-design methodology on a set of real-life assay applications.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) is a mechanism that allows physical handling of liquids with only electrical signals, such as digitizing a liquid into tiny droplets and manipulating them on a chip, thus enabling ``digital microfluidics''. As an elegantly simple platform free of pumps or valves, EWOD digital microfluidics has been attracting high research interest in the past two decades and has recently been transitioned to a few commercial products in displays and biochemistry. However, the number of labs utilizing this technology is still small, due to the difficulty in translating design intent to manufactured devices. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a cloud-based opensource EWOD cybermanufacturing ecosystem that enables an automatic translation from user requirements to manufactured digital microfluidics. The incubation cyber ecosystem is to be accessible to a wide range of end users, allowing researchers, entrepreneurs, students, and hobbyists alike to focus on their own ideas and applications without having to master the subtleties of EWOD engineering and manufacturing. This can be thought of as an ``operating system'' for EWOD community, similar to Windows and macOS for people with no computer hardware background. The proposed cyber ecosystem aims to ease the process of designing and eliminate the burden of fabricating EWOD chips so that the user pool is increased and more applications found for EWOD digital microfluidics.},

  abstract = {Interdigital capacitive sensors are applied in nondestructive testing and material property characterization of lowconductivity materials. The sensor performance is typically described based on the penetration depth of the electric field into the sample material, the sensor signal strength and its sensitivity. These factors all depend on the geometry and material properties of the sensor and sample. In this paper, a detailed analysis is provided, through finite element simulations, of the ways in which the sensor's geometrical parameters affect its performance. The geometrical parameters include the number of digits forming the interdigital electrodes and the ratio of digit width to their separation. In addition, the influence of the presence or absence of a metal backplane on the sample is analyzed. Further, the effects of sensor substrate thickness and material on signal strength are studied. The results of the analysis show that it is necessary to take into account a trade-off between the desired sensitivity and penetration depth when designing the sensor. Parametric equations are presented to assist the sensor designer or nondestructive evaluation specialist in optimizing the design of a capacitive sensor.},

  abstract = {A serial-parallel conversion test strategy is proposed for the test path optimization of digital microfluidic biochip which is parallelly tested by multiple droplets. It can solve the problem of the test path repetition in the partition method, as well as the droplet fluid conflict in the traditional non-partition method. Firstly, a hybrid algorithm based on priority strategy and genetic algorithm is designed to optimize the parallel test path of the biochip, so as to avoid the problem that the search process is too random when only a single intelligent algorithm is used to optimize the test path. Then an adaptive method is proposed to adjust the amount of test tasks, which can improve the average distribution method of test tasks and further optimize the parallel test of the digital microfluidic biochip. The test simulation of nine different array chips shows that the serial-parallel conversion strategy proposed in this paper is better than the partition strategy, and the experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the test efficiency of digital microfluidic biochips and reduce the test cost.},

  abstract = {Two methods were studied for selectively measuring the on-chip absorbance of trace sulfate analytes in droplets on a digital microfluidics (DMF) platform. In one method, the direction of measurement was perpendicular to the flat upper and lower surfaces of the DMF platform (vertical), and in the second method, the measurement direction was parallel to the DMF platform surfaces (horizontal). The channel height or the vertical light path length was 0.24 mm, and the droplet diameter was 1 mm. The DMF system employed a silicone oil transport medium whereby a thin, non-uniform oil layer formed between the droplet and the upper/lower plates which was unstable, resulting in randomly formed local oil lenses. The mobile oil lenses caused vertical absorbance measurement errors and uncertainties. The effects of the oil lenses were verified by simulation. Horizontal absorbance measurements were taken with embedded optical fibers (0.2 mm in diameter) aligned over the bottom chip surface in contact with the sides of the droplet, resulting in a horizontal light path length approximately three times that of the vertical light path. Because no oil lenses could form on the droplet's sides, the stability of repeated horizontal measurements outperformed repeated vertical measurements made on the same droplet and on multiple droplets actuated into the measurement positions. Comparisons were based on measurement standard deviations and limits of detection (LOD). The following LODs and measurement standard deviations were achieved for horizontal measurements of multiple sulfate concentrations in 1.5 {\textmu}l droplets: 7 ppm for sulfate (0.3--2.7\%) and an R2 value of 0.957 from a least square data fit. Measurements on a commercial plate reader gave comparable results (200 {\textmu}l liquid in each well, LOD equals 11 ppm, CV equals to 0.2--4\%), even though the absorbance path was larger (0.7 mm). This LOD value means that the chip could detect 10.5 ng of sulfate. LOD values on vertical measurements were also similar, but large measurement errors from numerous outlier points yielded an R2 value of 0.735 and large average measurement standard deviations (36\%).},

With the assistance of CAD tools, users can concentrate on the development and abstraction of nanoscale bioassays while leaving chip optimization and implementation details to CAD tools.},

  abstract = {Designs for pin-constrained digital microfluidic biochips (PDMFBs) are receiving much attention because they simplify chip fabrication and packaging, and reduce product cost. To reduce the pin count, broadcast addressing, by minimally grouping electrode sets with non-conflict signal merging, has emerged as a promising solution. Nevertheless, naive signal merging has the potential to cause excessive electrode actuations, which has been reported to have direct and adverse effect on chip reliability. According to recent studies, reliability is an important attribute for PDMFBs particularly developed for medical applications as it directly affects the final medical decision making. However, no research findings have been reported on the reliability problem in pin-constrained designs. To make PDMFBs more feasible for practical applications, we propose in this paper the first matchingbased reliability-oriented broadcast-addressing algorithm for PDMFBs. We identify the factors that affect reliability and incorporate into the design-technique attributes that enhance reliability. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Although it was shown to be compatible with on-line mass spectrometric detection, due to numerous technical obstacles, the implementation of DMF in conjunction with MS is still beyond the reach of many analytical laboratories. Here we present a facile method for coupling open DMF microchips to mass spectrometers using Venturi easy ambient sonic-spray ionization operated at atmospheric pressure. The proposed interface comprises a 3D-printed body that can easily be ``clipped'' at the inlet of a standard mass spectrometer. The accessory features all the necessary connections for an open-architecture DMF microchip with T-shaped electrode arrangement, thermostatting of the microchip, purification of air (to prevent accidental contamination of the microchip), a Venturi pump, and two microfluidic pumps to facilitate transfer of samples and reagents onto the microchip. The system also incorporates a touch-screen panel and remote control for user-friendly operation. It is based on the use of popular open-source electronic modules, and can readily be assembled at low expense.},

  abstract = {In point-of-care testing (POCT), tests are performed near patients and results are given rapidly for timely clinical decisions. Immunodiagnostic assays are one of the most important analyses for detecting and quantifying proteinbased biomarkers. However, existing POCT immunodiagnostics mainly rely on the lateral flow assay (LFA), which has limited sensitivity or quantification capability. Although other immunodiagnostic assays, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), offer more sensitive and quantitative results, they require complex liquid manipulations that are difficult to implement in POCT settings by conventional means. Here, we show the development of DropLab, an automated sample-in-answer-out POCT immunodiagnostic platform based on magnetic digital microfluidic (MDM) technology. DropLab performs microbead-based ELISA in droplets to offer more sensitive and quantitative testing results. The intricate liquid manipulations required for ELISA are accomplished by controlling droplets with magnetic microbeads using MDM technology, which enables us to achieve full automation and easy operations with DropLab. Four ELISAs (the sample in triplicates and a negative control) can be run in parallel on the thermoformed disposable chip, which greatly improves the throughput and accuracy compared to those of other POCT immunodiagnostic devices. DropLab was validated by measuring two protein targets and one antibody target. The testing results showed that the limit of detection (LOD) of DropLab matched that of the conventional ELISA in a microwell plate. DropLab brings MDM one step closer to being a viable medical technology that is ready for real-world POCT applications.},

The first member of the family, Ti               3               C               2               T               x               , was reported in 2011. Since then MXenes have opened up an exciting new field in 2D inorganic functional materials by virtue of their intrinsic electronic conductivity, superior hydrophilicity, rich surface chemistry and layered structure, as evidenced by the fact that the number of papers on MXenes has increased exponentially. The unique properties and ease of processing have positioned them as promising materials for a variety of applications including energy storage, especially for supercapacitors. In this review, we aim to summarize the current advances in MXene research on supercapacitors. We begin by reviewing various fabrication routes and their influence on the structure and surface chemistry of MXenes. The structure, properties, stability, and species of layered MXenes are then introduced. The focus then turns to the capacitive energy-storage mechanisms and the factors determining the electrochemical behavior and performance in supercapacitors. Besides, various types of MXene-based supercapacitors are summarized to highlight the significance of MXenes in constructing energy storage devices. Finally, challenges and prospects in this booming field are proposed to promote further development of MXenes in supercapacitors.},

Potential technological applications are manifold, from novel materials to scaffolds for tissue engineering or enhanced oil recovery. More fundamentally, microfluidics makes it possible to investigate the physics of complex systems such as foams at scales where the capillary forces become dominant, in model experiments involving few well-controlled parameters. In this context, this review does not have the ambition to detail in a comprehensive manner all the techniques and applications involving bubbles and foams in microfluidics. Rather, it focuses on particular consequences of working at the microscale, under confinement, and hopes to provide insight into the physics of such systems. The first part of this work focuses on bubbles, and more precisely on (i) bubble generation, where the confinement can suppress capillary instabilities while inertial effects may play a role, and (ii) bubble dynamics, paying special attention to the lubrication film between bubble and wall and the influence of confinement. The second part addresses the formation and dynamics of microfoams, emphasizing structural differences from macroscopic foams and the influence of the confinement.},

With support of highly scalable thin-film semiconductor technology, high-resolution digital droplets (diameter around 100 {$\mu$}m) containing single-cell samples can be manipulated freely on a two-dimensional plane with programmable addressing logic. In addition, singlecell generation and manipulation as foundations for single-cell research demand ease of operation, multifunctionality, and accurate tools. In this work, we reported an active-matrix digital microfluidic platform for single-cell generation and manipulation. The active device contained 26,368 electrodes that could be independently addressed to perform parallel and simultaneous droplet generation and achieved single-cell manipulation. We demonstrate a high-resolution digital droplet generation with a droplet volume limit of 500 pL and show the continuous and stable movement of droplet-contained cells for over 1 h. Furthermore, the success rate of single droplet formation was higher than 98\%, generating tens of single cells within 10 s. In addition, a pristine single-cell generation rate of 29\% was achieved without further selection procedures, and the droplets containing single cells could then be tested for on-chip cell culturing. After 20 h of culturing, about 12.5\% of the single cells showed cell proliferation.},

MDM is capable of dispensing droplets of desired volume using surface energy traps (SETs); however, the daughter droplets dispensed by this approach cannot be released from the SET for subsequent microfluidic manipulation. This is a major disadvantage compared to the electrowettingon-dielectrics (EWOD)-based digital microfluidics which is capable of releasable droplet dispensing. In this work, a polydopamine-coated thin magnet is introduced to MDM as a mobile SET for droplet manipulation, and for the first time, releasable droplet dispensing is accomplished on the MDM platform. In addition, the mobile SET is capable of all-terrain droplet transport regardless of the surface condition and rapid droplet transport via a unique droplet slingshot mechanism. The mobile SET-enabled MDM platform is able to match the functionality of the EWOD-based digital microfluidic system in terms of droplet dispensing and release, which will significantly expand the applicability and acceptability of MDM technology in biosensing, in vitro diagnostics, and many other biomedical applications.},

While microfluidic devices have shown their capability in point-of-care applications, some of them face the challenge in on-chip sample preparation, such as DNA extraction from blood samples, prior to the diagnosis. Although digital microfluidic (DMF) eliminates the need of complicated fluidic actuation components and draws great attentions as a promising Lab-on-a-Chip platform, its capability in DNA extraction has been limitedly shown. Herein, we develop a protocol on a DMF platform for DNA extraction. As the protocol contains blood, magnetic beads, a variety of liquids, and complicated steps, it was implemented in a sequence of droplet operations with our proposed washing/droplet-separation strategy. Our on-chip extraction protocol was conducted with room-temperature incubations and much less washing cycles. The results were confirmed by using SYBR-Green dye staining and gel electrophoresis. Therefore, the DMF device was shown to permit on-chip DNA extraction with fewer sample/reagent consumption and shorter operation time.},

  abstract = {Microfluidic devices based on Electronic Wetting on Dielectrics (EWOD) have gained wide attention in areas such as lab-on-a-chip, and how to effectively improve the driving capability of EWOD devices has been a matter of concern. In order to improve the driving performance of the device, this paper is aimed at the design modeling, simulation verification and physical preparation of the electrode shape of the EWOD device. The theoretical model is modified mainly around the contact angle saturation of the droplet and the structural parameters on the base plate to make it closer to the actual test results. And the driving ability of the designed electrode shape is verified by simulation and device preparation. The results show that the electrode shape designed in this paper has improved the droplet driving ability by about 17\% compared with the typical electrode shape at 25 V DC voltage. In conclusion, The electrode shape designed in this paper not only improves the driving capability for regular-sized droplets, but also has excellent driving capability for small-sized droplets.},

This emerging technology combines electronics with biology to open new application areas such as point-of-care diagnosis, on-chip DNA analysis, and automated drug discovery. We propose a design automation method for pin-constrained LoCs that manipulate nanoliter volumes of discrete droplets on a microfluidic array. In contrast to the direct-addressing scheme that has been studied thus far in the literature, we assign a small number of independent control pins to a large number of electrodes in the LoC, thereby reducing design complexity and product cost. We apply the proposed method to a microfluidic array for a set of multiplexed bioassays.},

  abstract = {Digital-microfluidics technology has shown considerable promise for advancing sample preparation and pointof-care diagnostics; therefore, it has the potential to transform microbiology and biochemistry research. Over the past decade, a number of microfluidics design-automation techniques have been developed for on-chip droplet manipulation. However, these methods overlook the myriad complexities of biomolecular protocols and they have yet to make a significant impact in biochemistry/microbiology research. A paradigm shift in biochip design automation and a ``phase transition'' in research are clearly needed to bridge this gap between microfluidics and microbiology. In this paper, we explain how researchers from design-automation and embedded systems can play a key role in this transition. We present a new synthesis flow that uses realistic models of biomolecular protocols and cyberphysical adaptation to address real-world microbiology applications. We also present a list of metrics that can be used for the assessment of designautomation techniques for microbiology applications.},

A theoretical approach is proposed to optimize the use of the sensor for bioimpedance spectroscopy. The correlation between design parameters and frequency behavior in coplanar impedance sensors are described. CoventorWare software was used to model the biological medium loaded interdigital sensor in three dimensions to measure its electrical impedance. Complete system simulation by a finite element method (FEM) was used for sensor sensitivity optimization. The influence of geometrical parameters (number of fingers, width of the electrodes) on the impedance spectroscopy of the biological medium was studied. The simulation results are in agreement with the theoretical equations of optimization. Thus, it is possible to design a priori such sensor by taking into account the biological medium of interest that will load the sensor.},

However, today's solutions suffer from the drawback that multiple sample pathways are not supported and on-chip reconfigurable devices are not efficiently exploited. As a result, impractical manual intervention is needed to process protocols for gene-expression analysis. To overcome this problem, we first describe our benchtop experimental studies to understand gene-expression analysis and its relationship to the biochip design specification. We then introduce an integrated framework for quantitative gene-expression analysis using digital-microfluidic biochips. The proposed framework includes: (i) a spatial-reconfiguration technique that incorporates resourcesharing specifications into the synthesis flow; (ii) an interactive firmware that collects and analyzes sensor data based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction; (iii) a real-time resourceallocation scheme that responds promptly to decisions about the protocol flow received from the firmware layer. This framework is combined with cyberphysical integration to develop the first design-automation framework for quantitative gene expression. Simulation results show that our adaptive framework efficiently utilizes on-chip resources to reduce time-to-result without sacrificing the chip's lifetime.},

  abstract = {We present a tunable-angle wedge ultrasound transducer for improved control of microparticle acoustophoresis in a microfluidic chip. The transducer is investigated by analyzing the pattern of aligned particles and induced acoustic energy density while varying the transducer geometry, transducer coupling angle, and transducer actuation method (single-frequency actuation or frequency-modulation actuation). The energy-density analysis is based on measuring the transmitted light intensity through a microfluidic channel filled with a suspension of 5 {$\mu$}m diameter beads and the results with the tunable-angle transducer are compared with the results from actuation by a standard planar transducer in order to decouple the influence from change in coupling angle and change in transducer geometry. We find in this work that the transducer coupling angle is the more important parameter compared to the concomitant change in geometry and that the coupling angle may be used as an additional tuning parameter for improved acoustophoretic control with single-frequency actuation. Further, we find that frequency-modulation actuation is suitable for diminishing such tuning effects and that it is a robust method to produce uniform particle patterns with average acoustic energy densities comparable to those obtained using single-frequency actuation.},

The results of the numerical model have been validated with published experimental data and the physics of droplet transport have been investigated. A parametric study has been performed in which the effects of voltage amplitude, channel gap, and electrode size have been examined.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Phosphorus is an essential element for water quality control. Excessive amounts of phosphorus causes algal bloom in water, which leads to eutrophication and a decline in water quality. It is necessary to maintain the optimum amount of phosphorus present. During the last decades, various studies have been conducted to determine phosphorus content in water. In this study, we present a comprehensive overview of colorimetric, electrochemical, fluorescence, microfluidic, and remote sensing technologies for the measurement of phosphorus in water, along with their working principles and limitations. Results: The colorimetric techniques determine the concentration of phosphorus through the use of colorgenerating reagents. This is specific to a single chemical species and inexpensive to use. The electrochemical techniques operate by using a reaction of the analyte of interest to generate an electrical signal that is proportional to the sample analyte concentration. They show a good linear output, good repeatability, and a high detection capacity. The fluorescence technique is a kind of spectroscopic analysis method. The particles in the sample are excited by irradiation at a specific wavelength, emitting radiation of a different wavelength. It is possible to use this for quantitative and qualitative analysis of the target analyte. The microfluidic techniques incorporate several features to control chemical reactions in a micro device of low sample volume and reagent consumption. They are cheap and rapid methods for the detection of phosphorus in water. The remote sensing technique analyzes the sample for the target analyte using an optical technique, but without direct contact. It can cover a wider area than the other techniques mentioned in this review. Conclusion: It is concluded that the sensing technologies reviewed in this study are promising for rapid detection of phosphorus in water. The measurement range and sensitivity of the sensors have been greatly improved recently.},

The effect of graphite powder mass fraction on the magnitude of the potentiometric response of the sensor was systematically verified using a batch-mode and a flow injection measurement setup. Under steady-state conditions, the paper electrode provided a Nernstian response of 57.30 mV/pNH4 over the concentration range of 10-5 M to 10-1 M with a detection limit of 4.8 {\texttimes} 10-6 M, while the analytical performance of the array in flow mode showed a narrower linear range (10-4 M to 10-1 M; 60.91 mV/pNH4 slope) with a LOD value of 5.6 {\texttimes} 10-5 M. The experimental results indicate that the prepared electrode exhibited high stability and fast response to different molar concentrations of ammonium chloride solutions. The pHresponse of the paper NH4-ISE was also investigated, and the sensor remained stable in the pH range of 2.5--8.5. The potentiometric sensor presented here is simple, lightweight and inexpensive, with a potential application for in-situ analysis of environmental water samples.},

  abstract = {Studying the dynamic behavior of droplets is of great importance in the electrowetting phenomena. However, despite the widespread use of non-Newtonian fluids in industry and daily life including medicine, food, petroleum, environmental biomass, and lab on a chip, most studies have focused on Newtonian fluids. In this study, a power-law fluid is considered as a typical example of non-Newtonian fluids and its dynamic behavior is investigated within a microchannel, and the results are compared with those of the Newtonian fluids. Both the grooved and nongrooved substrates are considered. For this purpose, the governing equations for the two phase fluid flow are solved using the finite element method, and the phase field method is used for interface tracking. We show that for four types of the considered grooves in the microchannel, different changes in the fluid dynamics are observed. When the droplets pass over the grooves, the velocity decreases and the pressure drop increases. These behaviors are intensified when the size of the grooves increases. In the shear thinning fluids, the velocity reduction is larger and even causes the drop to stop. However, in the shear thickening fluids, the velocity reduction is smaller, and the droplets can cross the grooves. After the grooves, the velocity of the droplets increases suddenly. Finally, it is shown that the time of separation of a droplet in the splitting process completely depends on the fluid type, which is much less in the shear thinning fluids compared to the shear thickening types.},

The penetration of AgNW ink through the paper's thickness by capillary imbibition allows for multilayer electrical access to connect the individual electrodes. This makes it an automated and efficient choice as the functional area of the device is conserved and the surface of the paper is preserved. This allows for two-dimensional droplet manipulation on a paper-based digital microfluidics (PBDMF) platform. Compared to printed circuit board technology, paper-based electronics offer a range of desirable properties: they are light weight, portable, economical, flexible, biodegradable, and the materials are abundantly available. The fabricated PBDMF chip is demonstrated to be a low-cost, fully reconfigurable, and disposable point-of-care diagnostic platform for the environmental sensing of pesticide using organophosphorus hydrolase enzyme through colorimetric detection via smartphone.},

  abstract = {We describe the design and performance of a portable closed electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) system for digital microfluidics applications. The system is cost-effective and is capable of controlling the motion of one or more droplets under the influence of an asymmetric electric field. Using polypropylene (commercial cello tape) as a dielectric layer with GlacoTM spray to create a hydrophobic surface lowers device fabrication cost. For the first time, a superhydrophobic GlacoTM layer (equilibrium contact angle * 150{$^\circ$}) is used for the EWOD device fabrication. The device has four modules that are designed to provide a high actuation voltage in the range of 5--300 VDC over the array of electrode pads. Given a large enough electrode array over the lower surface, the effect of the applied potential of the top electrode on droplet motion is studied via numerical simulation and is shown to be insignificant. This result further helps in simplifying the fabrication process. The user-friendly interface that defines droplet motion is designed using Qt, a cross-platform framework that is used as a graphical toolkit and an open-source image processing software in Raspberry Pi. Two types of closed EWOD configurations are developed to demonstrate their features in terms of moving and merging multiple droplets. For the designs implemented, the greatest speed of droplet movement at 295 VDC was measured to be 60 mm/s. Additional features of the device include calculation of the real-time mixing index and a thermal management module for temperature control. The simplicity of design and low-cost makes the device attractive for studying electrically induced drop motion on one end to a biomedical diagnostic test kit, on the other.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) based digital microfluidics (DMF) emerges as a modern paradigm for lab on a chip (LOC) application, as it offers advantages of portability, automation, higher sensitivity and high throughput in diagnosis applications. One of the challenges in designing of EWOD devices for such applications is managing many droplets on the single substrate. The controlling of the droplet traffic requires a feedback control system whose sensor can continuously monitor the droplet parameters like contact angle, position, size, and velocity. In this work, we have demonstrated a low-cost open EWOD based dynamic sensing system, which is capable of tracking multiple droplets on the single substrate in real time. Droplet parameters are measured by sensing the capacitance value between electrode pad and ground wire. This makes the systems scalable, portable, robust, highly sensitive and inexpensive. We have used printed circuit board (PCB) based open EWOD device, where polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is used as a dielectric as well as a hydrophobic layer. The analytical model for droplet velocity has been developed, which matches quite well with experimental results. The droplet sensing approach presented in this work, adds to the functionality of DMF by allowing measurement with top ground configuration. {\copyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Magnetic particles are largely used in various applications and particularly in in-vitro biomedical diagnostic and bionanotechnology. In fact, they have been employed for extraction of various biomolecules even from crude samples and as solid support in numerous samples' preparation for in-vitro diagnosis. Nowadays, they are also successfully being exploited as a carrier of biomolecules in microsystems, microfluidics, lab-on-a-chip and for detection in specific biosensors. Before any use or any preparation of magnetic hybrid particles, various factors should be considered in order to perfectly target the suitable applications. For instance, in case of nucleic acid, the particles shouldn't induce any inhibition of biological amplification techniques. For microfluidic, these particles should be colloidal stable in order to avoid any jump in the microfluidic canals. Regarding biosensor, these particles need to be chemically well designed generally to enhance specific detection or specific signal.},

The combination of high toxicity and widespread occurrence has created a pressing need for effective monitoring and measurement of nitrate and heavy metals in soil pore water and groundwater at shallow depths. In this work, a new electrochemical sensing platform with the self-assembly nanobeadspacked (nBP) hetero columns has been developed for the pH and nitrate measurements. In addition, for on-site determination of cadmium (Cd(II)), a bismuth (Bi(III)) based polymer lab chip sensor using the square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV) sensing principle has been designed, fabricated and successfully characterized. Factors affecting sensitivity and precision of the sensor, including deposition potential and deposition time, were studied. Miniaturized electrochemical lab chip sensors could be very valuable in environmental monitoring area due to their many benefits, such as greatly reduced sensing cost, sensing system portability, and ease of use.},

  abstract = {As a result of increased water demand and water pollution, both surface water and groundwater quantity and quality are of major concern worldwide. In particular, the presence of nutrients and heavy metals in water is a serious threat to human health. The initial step for the effective management of surface waters and groundwater requires regular, continuous monitoring of water quality in terms of contaminant distribution and source identification. Because of this, there is a need for screening and monitoring measurements of these compounds at contaminated areas. However, traditional monitoring techniques are typically still based on laboratory analyses of representative field-collected samples; this necessitates considerable effort and expense, and the sample may change before analysis. Furthermore, currently available equipment is so large that it cannot usually be made portable. Alternatively, lab chip and electrochemical sensing-based portable monitoring systems appear well suited to complement standard analytical methods for a number of environmental monitoring applications. In addition, this type of portable system could save tremendous amounts of time, reagent, and sample if it is installed at contaminated sites such as Superfund sites (the USA's worst toxic waste sites) and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) facilities or in rivers and lakes. Accordingly, state-of-the-art monitoring equipment is necessary for accurate assessments of water quality. This article reviews details on our development of these lab-on-a-chip (LOC) sensors.},

  abstract = {An inexpensive, disposable and highly selective microfluidic paper-based analytical device ({\textmu}PAD) is described for the determination of ammonia (molecular ammonia and ammonium cation) in wastewaters which implements for the first time a gas-diffusion separation step on a paper-based platform. Its hydrophilic reagent zones were defined by printing filter paper with a hydrophobic paper sizing agent using a conventional inkjet printer. The sample was introduced into the impregnated with sodium hydroxide sample zone of the {\textmu}PAD. This allowed the quantitative conversion of the ammonium ion to molecular ammonia which diffused across the hydrophobic microporous Teflon membrane of the device into an adjacent hydrophilic reagent zone containing the acid-base indicator 3-nitrophenol or bromothymol blue. The change in indicator color was measured using a desktop scanner for ammonia quantification. Under optimal conditions, the {\textmu}PAD is characterised by a limit of detection of 0.8 and 1.8 mg N L-1 and repeatability of 3.1\% and 3.7\% (n {$\geq$} 10, 20 mg N L-1), expressed as relative standard deviation, in the case of 3-nitrophenol or bromothymol blue, respectively. This {\textmu}PAD was used successfully for the determination of ammonia in sewage and soil water samples. The small dimensions, minimal reagent consumption, low cost, simplicity of operation, and possibility of using a portable scanner make the proposed {\textmu}PAD an attractive sensor for on-site ammonia monitoring in contaminated environmental waters and domestic, agricultural and industrial wastewaters. The successful implementation of the gas-diffusion approach on a paper-based platform is expected to result in the development of other {\textmu}PADs for volatile analytes.},

  abstract = {Water crisis is a global issue due to water contamination and extremely restricted sources of fresh water. Water contamination induces severe diseases which put human lives at risk. Hence, water quality monitoring has become a prime activity worldwide. The available monitoring procedures are inadequate as most of them require expensive instrumentation, longer processing time, tedious processes, and skilled lab technicians. Therefore, a portable, sensitive, and selective sensor with in situ and continuous water quality monitoring is the current necessity. In this context, microfluidics is the promising technology to fulfill this need due to its advantages such as faster reaction times, better process control, reduced waste generation, system compactness and parallelization, reduced cost, and disposability. This paper presents a review on the latest enhancements of microfluidic-based electrochemical and optical sensors for water quality monitoring and discusses the relative merits and shortcomings of the methods.},

The total pressure withstood is found to scale approximately linearly with the number of droplets.

For fast switching and continuous applications, hotplate or Peltier elements can be employed. However, due to bulkiness, they are ineffective for portable applications or operation at remote locations. Miniaturization of heaters reduces power consumption and bulkiness, enhances the thermal response, and integrates with several sensors or microfluidic chips. The microheater has a thickness of {\textasciitilde} 100 nm to {\textasciitilde} 100 {$\mu$}m and offers a temperature range up to 1900{\textcelsius} with precise control. In recent years, due to the escalating demand for flexible electronics, thin-film microheaters have emerged as an imperative research area. This review provides an overview of recent advancements in microheater as well as analyses different microheater designs, materials, fabrication, and temperature control. In addition, the applications of microheaters in gas sensing, biological, and electrical and mechanical sectors are emphasized. Moreover, the maximum temperature, voltage, power consumption, response time, and heating rate of each microheater are tabulated. Finally, we addressed the specific key considerations for designing and fabricating a microheater as well as the importance of microheater integration in COVID-19 diagnostic kits. This review thereby provides general guidelines to researchers to integrate microheater in micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), which may pave the way for developing rapid and large-scale SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic kits in resource-constrained clinical or home-based environments.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) chips have become the most popular actuators, particularly for droplet-based digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) systems. In order to enable the electrical manipulations, wire routing is a key problem in designing EWOD chips. Unlike traditional very-large-scaleintegration (VLSI) routing problems, in addition to routing-path establishment on signal pins, the pin-constrained EWOD-chip routing problem must address the issue of signal sharing for pincount reduction under a practical constraint posed by a limited pin-count supply. Moreover, EWOD-chip designs might incur several obstacles in the routing region due to embedded devices for specific fluidic protocols. However, no existing work considers the EWOD-chip routing with obstacles and, therefore, lots of manual design efforts are involved. To remedy this insufficiency, we propose in this paper the first routing algorithm for pinconstrained EWOD chips with obstacle avoidance. The proposed algorithm, based on effective integer-linear-programming (ILP) formulation as well as efficient routing framework, can achieve high routability with a low design complexity. Experimental results based on real-life chips with obstacles demonstrate the high routability of proposed algorithm for pin-constrained EWOD chips with obstacle avoidance.},

A smart detection system is essential for ensuring a fully automatic workflow and online programming for the subsequent experimental steps. In this work, we demonstrated an artificial intelligence (AI)enabled multipurpose smart detection method in an AM-EWOD system for different tasks. We employed the U-Net model to quantitatively evaluate the uniformity of the applied droplet-splitting methods. We used the YOLOv8 model to monitor the droplet-splitting process online. A 97.76\% splitting success rate was observed with 18 different AMEWOD chips. A 99.982\% model precision rate and a 99.980\% model recall rate were manually verified. We employed an improved YOLOv8 model to detect single-cell samples in nanolitre droplets. Compared with manual verification, the model achieved 99.260\% and 99.193\% precision and recall rates, respectively. In addition, single-cell droplet sorting and routing experiments were demonstrated. With an AI-based smart detection system, AM-EWOD has shown great potential for use as a ubiquitous platform for implementing true lab-on-a-chip applications.},

A novel disposable multiplexed microfluidic device has been developed herein that allows the quantitative detection of up to five parameters at once. Solid reagent rather than commonly used liquid reagent was used to ensure long shelf life, and a ``flow to dissolve'' mechanism was provided accordingly for the thorough dissolution and mixing of a solid reagent on chip. Samples from river water and industrial wastewater were tested using the microfluidic chip, showing less than 15\% deviation from results acquired with the traditional standard method. The test time though was only 1/6 of that required by the traditional method. In addition, the feasibility of using a smartphone to collect the colorimetric signal was discussed, and a data analysis method was provided for quantification purposes. The combination of the multiplexed chip and smartphone imaging provides a convenient and practical way to obtain accurate information on the water quality within a short period of time without the use of any sophisticated instruments.},

  abstract = {As a revolutionary platform for miniaturizing laboratory procedures, the digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) has the advantages of flexibility and re-configurability over its flow-based counterpart. Droplet routing is one of the most challenging problems in the design automation of DMFBs, which aims to schedule the movements of a set of droplets from their source electrodes to their target electrodes and satisfy both static and dynamic fluidic constraints. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary algorithm (EA) based droplet routing method with an indirect encoding scheme and an improved Dijkstra-based decoding strategy, to minimize the arrival time of the droplets. To be specific, the priority of the movements of the droplets are encoded in the chromosome instead of directly encoding the solution of the problem, i.e., a complete path from the source to the target for each droplet. In the 2D-routing decoding stage, a problem-specific cost function is defined and introduced in the Dijkstra algorithm for obtaining a more time-efficient path for each droplet. Meanwhile, to avoid accidental mixing of the droplets during their movements, several strategies are proposed to modify the paths for satisfying the fluidic constraints in different scenarios of both 2D-routing and 3D-compaction. Compared with the stateof-the-art droplet routing algorithms, the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method based on two synthetic benchmark suites and a real-world bioassay benchmark suite.},

Conventional methods for foodborne pathogen detection are time-consuming and laborious due to the requirement of a series of processes including cell enrichment, isolation and morphological identification. Therefore the demand for rapid, sensitive, inexpensive and convenient approaches to detect foodborne pathogenic bacteria has emerged in recent years. Among the new approaches, microfluidic chip-based detection has generated growing interest because of the miniaturized size, improved sensitivity and reduced detection time of the devices. In addition, the applications of nanomaterials and magnetic microbeads have further facilitated target recognition and signal transduction processes in microfluidic pathogen detection. The lab-on-a-chip technique has developed into an alternative to conventional methods to detect foodborne pathogens owing to its potentials to offer desired sensitivity and to respond in a short test time. Most recently, smartphones and 3-D printing technologies are attracting growing attention for enhanced detection performances. This paper reviews the most recent developments and trends in miniaturized microfluidic devices based on different recognition principles and signal amplification methods to detect foodborne pathogens. In particular, emphasis will be put on those that offer both rapid detection result turn-around and ultra-low detection limit of 10               2               to 10               3               cells per mL or even single-cell detection.},

Simulation results show that it can provide a 48 V pixel voltage and demonstrate a sensing voltage difference of over 10 V between deionized water and silicone oil, illustrating its proficiency in droplet driving and accurate sensing. The stability of threshold voltage drift and temperature was also verified for the circuit.

The two technologies are essential in the point-of-care area. Electrochemical detection on electrodes and DMF-based droplet driving electrode realize their respective functions by means of electrical signals. In terms of working mode, it seems to have certain similarity, and electrochemical sensing seems to be more suitable for integrating digital microfluidic systems. We thus integrated electrochemical sensing on an active matrix (AM) DMF system. As a common transparent conductive glass, indium tin oxide (ITO) has been widely used as the top plate of the digital microfluidic chip. In this work, we used ITO glass with patterned interdigital electrodes as the top plate of the AM-DMF chip. We achieved on-chip droplet volume detection by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). We also proposed a novel sample dilution method on the DMF chip. It takes only 30 seconds to dilute solutions into 4 different concentrations. We then analyzed droplet samples of different concentrations with EIS method. And the correlation coefficient of the fitted curve is as high as 0.9964. In conclusion, EIS is a powerful detection technology for fast, high-integration and low-cost detection on DMF system. The integration of EIS and DMF can be used in various biochemical analyses in the future.},

This paper presents an integrated microfluidic biosensing system designed for the rapid and sensitive detection of Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium). The biosensing system comprises a microfluidic chip with a versatile valve, a recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) for nucleic acid detection, and a customized real-time fluorescence detection system. The versatile valve combines the functions of an active valve and a magnetic actuation mixer, enabling on-demand mixing and controlling fluid flow. Quantitative fluorescence is processed and detected through a custom-built smartphone application. The proposed integrated microfluidic biosensing system could detect Salmonella at concentrations as low as 1.0 {\texttimes} 102 copies/{\textmu}L within 30 min, which was consistent with the results obtained from the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) tests. With its versatile valve, this integrated microfluidic biosensing system holds significant potential for on-site detection of foodborne pathogens.},

  abstract = {Micro total analysis systems (microTAS) provide the opportunity to create complete analytical microsystems by integrating various functional modules, such as sample preparation, separation and detection, into a single chipsized microfabricated device. Microfluidics is the enabling technology for implementing the concept of microTAS. Liquid marble (LM), as a promising separate digital microfluidic platform, has the great potential to enhance the broad applications of microTAS. LMs are small liquid droplets encapsulated by multilayered hydrophobic particles and have attracted a great interest from the microfluidics research community due to their non-wetting property. A LM maintains its integrity and exhibits low friction on various carrier surfaces, enabling the LM to be actuated by external electric, magnetic, gravitational and acoustic fields or other manipulation schemes. LMs can thus serve effectively for the storage and transportation of small liquid volumes. In addition, they have been widely used for the quick detection of water pollution or gas emission and, most importantly, micromixing and microreactions for chemical and biomedical purposes. This paper reviews the recent developments in the manipulation techniques and emerging applications of LMs. The review aims to facilitate better understanding of their use as a unique digital microfluidic platform to promote further advancement of microTAS. The paper begins with different manipulation schemes of LMs according to the nature of actuation energy. Next, it summarizes the diverse applications of LMs for various chemical and biological assays. Finally, this paper concludes with future perspectives regarding the research on LMs in microTAS technologies.},

It helps to realise parallel on-chip CLIA with enhanced magnetic beads washing efficiency.           ,                             In digital microfluidics, droplet generation is a fundamental operation for quantitative liquid manipulation. The generation of well-defined micro-droplets on a chip with restricted device geometries has become a real obstacle for digital microfluidics platforms to be used in parallel for               in vitro               diagnostic applications. Here, we propose a ``one-to-three'' droplet splitting technique that is able to generate sub-microlitre droplets beyond the ``well-known'' geometry limit in electrowetting-on-dielectric digital microfluidics. Accordingly, we realized an on-chip magnetic bead chemiluminescence immunoassay for parallel detection with the ``one-to-three'' technique. With the help of the generated micro droplets, we were able to retain the magnetic beads by a significantly reduced magnetic force. We have shown the detection of five B-type natriuretic peptide analyte samples on a single chip for around 10 minutes. The correlation coefficient of the calibration curve was 0.9942, and the detection limit was lower than 5 pg mL               -1               .},

The developments in the power electronics industry has over the years hinged on the progress of the semiconductor device industry. The semiconductor device industry could be said to be on the edge of a turn into a new era, a paradigm shift from the conventional silicon devices to the wide band gap semiconductor technologies. While a lot of work is being done in research and manufacturing sectors, it is important to look back at the past, evaluate the current progress and look at the prospects of the future of this industry. This paper is unique at this time because it seeks to give a good summary of the past, the state-of-the-art, and highlight the opportunities for future improvements. A more or less `forgotten' power electronic switch, the four-quadrant switch, is highlighted as an opportunity waiting to be exploited as this switch presents a potential for achieving an ideal switch.

The electromechanical force does not depend upon field-mediated changes of the contact angle; it is operative even if the liquid surface is constrained. Forces on liquid volumes may be determined using capacitance or the Maxwell stress tensor with no reference made to liquid surface profiles. According to this interpretation, a nonlinear mechanism manifesting a voltage threshold is responsible for both contact angle saturation and the observed clamping of the electromechanical force.},

The influence of the outer SR coating on the analytical performance of the K+-ISEs was studied. The presence of the SR coating did not affect the selectivity of the SC-ISE, indicating that the plasticizer, ionophore and lipophilic anion are spontaneously distributed from the PVC-based membrane into the SR layer. This was confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Interestingly, the reproducibility of the standard potential of the conditioned SC-ISE was significantly improved from E0 {\textpm} 35.3 mV to E0 {\textpm} 3.5 mV simply by adding the SR coating on top of the plasticized PVC based K+-selective membrane. Moreover, the adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA) was significantly reduced at the SR coated ion-selective membrane. Thus, the addition of a SR coating on a plasticized PVC ion-selective membrane seems to be a feasible method to improve the analytical performance and to reduce the biofouling of potentiometric ion sensors.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting on dielectric-based digital microfluidic platforms (EWOD-DMF) have a potential to impact point-of-care diagnostics. Conventionally, EWOD-DMF platforms are manufactured in cleanrooms by expert technicians using costly and time consuming micro-nanofabrication processes such as optical lithography, depositions and etching. However, such high-end microfabrication facilities are extremely challenging to establish in resource-poor and low-income countries, due to their high capital investment and operating costs. This makes the fabrication of EWOD-DMF platforms extremely challenging in low-income countries, where such platforms are most needed for many applications such as point-of-care testing applications. To address this challenge, we present a low-cost and simple fabrication procedure for EWOD-DMF electrode arrays, which can be performed anywhere with a commercial office inkjet printer without the need of expensive cleanroom facilities. We demonstrate the utility of our platform to move and mix droplets of different reagents and physiologically conductive buffers, thereby showing its capability to potentially perform a variety of biochemical assays. By combining our low-cost, inkjet-printed EWOD-DMF platform with smartphone imaging technology and a compact control system for droplet manipulation, we also demonstrate a portable and hand-held device which can be programmed to potentially perform a variety of biochemical assays.},

The second group comprises graphene and its derivatives (graphene, graphene oxides, reduced graphene oxides, and their composites with metal oxides and noble metals). The third group comprises 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (mainly sulfides of Mo, W, Sn, Ni, also in combination with metal oxides). They all have been found to enable RT sensing of gases such as NOx, NH3, H2, SO2, CO, and of vapors such as of acetone, formaldehyde or methanol. Attractive features also include high selectivity and sensitivity, long-term stability and affordable costs. Strengths and limitations of these materials are highlighted, and prospects with respect to the development of new materials to overcome existing limitations are discussed.},

  abstract = {Many laboratory scale biochemical processes, including clinical diagnostics are being revolutionized by Digital Microfluidic Biochips (DMFBs). This is owing to their high automation capability, low cost, portability, and efficiency. Central to the efficient operation of these devices is the droplet routing problem that aims to drive a set of droplets, each from its source to its target cells, without violating a given set of fluidic and timing constraints. The efficiency of the routing is measured by the amount of cells used and the arrival time of the latest droplet and both criteria are aimed to be minimized simultaneously. To solve this problem we propose an Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization algorithm for the Droplet Routing problem (EMO-DR) based on the NSGA-II framework, where the crossover operator is not used. EMO-DR features new mutation operators and a biased random generator of initial solutions. Experimental results show that the proposed approach produces competitive results when compared with those obtained through state-of-the-art methods. The paper also highlights the main challenges that evolutionary approaches need to solve when dealing with this routing problem.},

To enable sensitive capacitive detection of protein adsorption, the nanoislands were fabricated between finger electrodes of the IDE. The effect of the nanoislands on the sensitive capacitive measurement was estimated using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as a model protein. Additionally, a parylene-A film was coated on the IDE with nanoislands to improve the efficiency of protein immobilization. By using HRP and hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) as model analytes, the effect of the parylene-A film on the capacitive detection of protein adsorption was demonstrated.},

Among the designs, injectable forms of biomedical electronics are explored for accurate and safe targeting of deep-seated body organs. Here, the classes of biomedical electronics and tools that have high aspect ratio structures designed to be injected or inserted into internal organs for minimally invasive monitoring and therapy are reviewed. Compared with devices in bulky or planar formats, the long shaft-like forms of implantable devices are easily placed in the organs with minimized outward protrusions via injection or insertion processes. Adding flexibility to the devices also enables effortless insertions through complex biological cavities, such as the cochlea, and enhances chronic reliability by complying with natural body movements, such as the heartbeat. Diverse types of such injectable implants developed for different organs are reviewed and the electronic, optoelectronic, piezoelectric, and microfluidic devices that enable stimulations and measurements of site-specific regions in the body are discussed. Noninvasive penetration strategies to deliver the miniscule devices are also considered. Finally, the challenges and future directions associated with deep body biomedical electronics are explained.},

A quick analysis time and high sensitivity, with a sample-to-answer format, are the most important features for current POCT diagnostic systems. Microfluidic lab-on-a-chip technologies have been considered as one of the promising solutions that can meet the requirement of the POCT since they can miniaturize and integrate most of the functional modules used in central laboratories into a small chip. This review covers recent advances in POCT technologies with an emphasis on demonstrated and commercially available POCT diagnostic systems with laboratory quality using microfluidic lab-on-achip technologies. As working principles and required functional modules depend on target analytes, we categorize the applications of the POCT diagnostic systems according to the analyte types such as proteins, cells, nucleic acids, and metabolites. In each analyte category, detection methods, configuration of POCT lab-on-a-chip modules, and advantages and disadvantages of POCT systems are reviewed and discussed along with future prospects.},

The sensitivity can be improved based on geometric parameters of the sensor. Hence, in this paper, we study the physical model of the IDEs-based sensor and concern with its geometrical parameters (gap sizes, number of fingers and width of fingers) based on the finite element simulations using COMSOL Multiphysics. The simulation results were used to show the electrical field that generated by the IDEs and compare to other to find the optimum design. Based on the results, the relationship between the geometric parameters and the IDEs performances are studied. The simulation results show that the higher electric fields are generated with the smaller gap size and smaller width of fingers. Besides that, the results show that the gap size and the width of fingers affect the IDEs performance significantly compared to the number of fingers. The IDE with the design 18 fingers, 0.1 mm gap size between fingers and 0.1 mm width of the finger is the optimum design which generates 30.6 kV/m average of electric field magnitude.},

However, the low-cost development of miniaturized gas sensors without compromising selectivity, sensitivity, and response time remains challenging. Microfluidics is a promising technology that has been exploited for decades to overcome such limitations, making it an excellent candidate for POU/POC. However, microfluidic-based gas sensors remain a nascent field. In this review, the evolution of microfluidic gas sensors from basic electronic techniques to more advanced optical techniques such as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy to detect analytes is documented in detail. This paper focuses on the various detection methodologies used in microfluidic-based devices for detecting gases and airborne pathogens. Non-continuous microfluidic devices such as bubble/droplet-based microfluidics technology that have been employed to detect gases and airborne pathogens are also discussed. The selectivity, sensitivity, advantages/disadvantages vis-a-vis response time, and fabrication costs for all the microfluidic sensors are tabulated. The microfluidic sensors are grouped based on the target moiety, such as air pollutants such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, and airborne pathogens such as E. coli and SARS-CoV-2. The possible application scenarios for the various microfluidic devices are critically examined.},

  abstract = {In this study, microscale interdigital capacitive sensors are designed, fabricated and embedded in glass fiber composite for real-time cure monitoring of resin. The microscale interdigital capacitive sensor offers great advantages due to its miniaturized size, high flexibility and high temperature stability. Most importantly, after integration, due to the small footprint and only 5 m thickness, the embedded sensor minimally downgrades the composite mechanical properties. Apart from all these merits, the substrate foil is perforated to provide an opportunity for the resin to go through the substrate and bridge it. The sensor consists of two interdigitated arrays. There are two different sensor designs, which offer 900 and 450 electrodes in arrays. The electrodes are made out of tantalum and are fully insulated with about 50 nm tantalum oxide. Therefore, it is possible to embed the sensor even in conductive fibers, e.g. carbon, and to use the sensor out of the Cleanroom without getting contaminated with conductive particles to shortcut the arrays. Polyimide is chosen for the substrate of the sensor. This specific polymer has excellent flexibility and its geometry stays unchanged even at high temperature. The Dielectric Analysis (DEA) measurement proves the effective and real-time tracking of resin polymerization during laminate production.},

Advances in sensor fabrication methods, scalable material synthesis, microelectronics, flexible electronics, and wireless communication have enabled the evolution of biosensing devices from traditional hospital-centric systems to home-centric solutions, suitable for use by non-experts to analyze early signs of diseases. Despite these advancements, key challenges remain, including scalability, material durability, power management, and seamless integration of biosensor components into user-friendly platforms. The translation of these technologies involves strategies to overcome these challenges, such as developing cost-effective manufacturing methods and optimizing device design for real-world applications. Furthermore, the integration of these devices with the Internet-of-Things (IoT), Internet-ofMedical-Things (IoMT), artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) algorithms has demonstrated breakthrough technological solutions for healthcare management, disease prognosis, and patient care. However, potential risks such as data security vulnerabilities, privacy concerns, and regulatory challenges must be addressed to ensure safe and ethical deployment of these technologies. Herein, we provide an in-depth analysis of the evolution of conventional electrochemical biosensors into miniaturized, integrated devices, focusing on their potential for better healthcare management and highlighting associated technical, regulatory, and ethical challenges. We also highlight key aspects of 6th generation sensing technology. Additionally, the role of IoT and AI-assisted technologies is critically discussed, presenting both their transformative benefits and the risks they pose in the biomedical field.},

  abstract = {The rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria requires the development of new diagnostic tests. Nucleic acid-based assays determine antimicrobial susceptibility by detecting genes that encode for the resistance. In this study, we demonstrate rapid and simultaneous detection of three genes that confer resistance in bacteria to extended spectrum {$\beta$}-lactam and carbapenem antibiotics; CTX-M-15, KPC and NDM-1. The assay uses isothermal DNA amplification (recombinase polymerase amplification, RPA) implemented on a programmable digital microfluidics (DMF) platform. Automated dispensing protocols are used to simultaneously manipulate 45 droplets of nL volume containing sample DNA, reagents, and controls. The droplets are processed and mixed under electronic control on the DMF devices with positive amplification measured by fluorescence. The assay on these devices is significantly improved with a Time to Positivity (TTP) half that of the benchtop assay.},

When water resources management can be managed in a systematic and effectively it can produce a good quality and clean water without any pollution. The objective of this study is to review water quality issues in the Kenyir Lake Basin and to identify the relationship between river discharges (Q) and the water quality status in Kenyir Lake Basin. Six water quality parameters were analyzed based on in-situ and ex-situ analysis and laboratory analyses were carried out according to the correlation matrix and linear regression methods. According to the NWQS, the water quality in Kenyir Lake Basin varied temporally and spatially and the most affected parameters were pH, DO, BOD, COD, TSS and AN. Furthermore, the water quality class in the Kenyir Lake Basin was classified under class II caused by the active land use activities especially tourism sector but it is still suitable for recreational activities and safe for body contact because the it's WQI is not less than 65\% which early stage of Class II. From this study, there are proposed several mitigation measures in management of water resources such as guarantee clean water supply and continuous, implementation a few of environmental acts, treating the water sources, develop alternative water sources and improve distribution systems and water management.},

Microdroplets present several unique characteristics of interest to a broader research community. The main distinguishing features include (i) large numbers of isolated compartments of tiny volumes that are ideal for single cell or single molecule assays, (ii) rapid mixing and negligible thermal inertia that all provide excellent control over reaction conditions, and (iii) the presence of two immiscible liquids and the interface between them that enables new or exotic processes (the synthesis of new functional materials and structures that are otherwise difficult to obtain, studies of the functions and properties of lipid and polymer membranes and execution of reactions at liquid--liquid interfaces). The most frequent application of droplet microfluidics relies on the generation of large numbers of compartments either for ultrahigh throughput screens or for the synthesis of functional materials composed of millions of droplets or particles. Droplet microfluidics has already evolved into a complex field. In this review we focus on `controlled droplet microfluidics' -- a portfolio of techniques that provide convenient platforms for multistep complex reaction protocols and that take advantage of automated and passive methods of fluid handling on a chip. `Controlled droplet microfluidics' can be regarded as a group of methods capable of addressing and manipulating droplets in series. The functionality and complexity of controlled droplet microfluidic systems can be positioned between digital microfluidics (DMF) addressing each droplet individually using 2D arrays of electrodes and ultrahigh throughput droplet microfluidics focused on the generation of hundreds of thousands or even millions of picoliter droplets that cannot be individually addressed by their location on a chip.},

Many of the advantages of mPADs, however, are limited to work in a laboratory setting due to the difficulties of processing data when using electronic devices in the field. This review focuses on the use of mPADs that have the potential to work without batteries or with only small and portable devices such as smartphones, timers, or miniaturized detectors. The mPADs that can be operated without batteries are, in general, those that allow the visual judgment of analyte concentrations via readouts that are measured in time, distance, count, or text. Conversely, a smartphone works as a camera to permit the capture and processing of an image that digitizes the color intensity produced by the reaction of an analyte with a colorimetric reagent. Miniaturized detectors for electrochemical, fluorometric, chemiluminescence, and electrochemiluminescence methods are also discussed, although some of them require the use of a laptop computer for operation and data processing.},

  abstract = {Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are a group of drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens that are classified as a critical threat by the World Health Organization (WHO). Conventional methods of detecting antibioticresistant pathogens do not assess the resistance mechanism and are often time-consuming and laborious. We have developed a magnetic digital microfluidic (MDM) platform, known as MDM Carba, for the identification of CPE by measuring their ability to hydrolyze carbapenem antibiotics. MDM Carba offers the ability to rapidly test CPE and reduce the amount of reagents used compared with conventional phenotypic testing. On the MDM Carba platform, tests are performed in droplets that function as reaction chambers, and fluidic operations are accomplished by manipulating these droplets with magnetic force. The simple droplet-based magnetic fluidic operation allows easy system automation and simplified hands-on operation. Because of the unique ``power-free'' operation of MDM technology, the MDM Carba platform can also be operated manually, showing great potential for point-of-care testing in resource-limited settings. We tested 27 bacterial isolates on the MDM Carba platform, and the results showed sensitivity and specificity that were comparable to those of the widely used Carba NP test. MDM Carba may shorten the overall turnaround time for CPE identification, thereby enabling more timely clinical decisions for better clinical outcomes. MDM Carba is a technological platform that can be further developed to improve diagnostics for other types of antibiotic resistance with minor modifications.},

To achieve a wide range of droplet manipulation, hydrophilic patterns, known as surface energy traps, are introduced onto the Teflon-coated hydrophobic substrate. However, the Teflon-coated substrate is difficult to modify because it is nonwettable, and existing techniques for patterning surface energy traps have many limitations. Inspired by the mussel adhesion mechanism, we use polydopamine, a bioinspired substance that adheres strongly to almost any materials, to pattern surface energy traps on the Teflon-coated substrate with a great ease. We have optimized the polydopamine coating protocol and characterized the surface properties of the polydopamine surface energy traps. Droplet operations including particle extraction, liquid dispensing, liquid shaping, and cross-platform transfer have been demonstrated on the polydopamine surface energy trap-enabled magnetic digital microfluidic platform in both single-plate and two-plate configurations. Furthermore, the detection of hepatitis B surface antigen using ELISA has been demonstrated on the new magnetic dgitial microfluidic platform. This new bioinspired magnetic digital microfluidic platform is easy to fabricate and operate, showing a great potential for point-of-care applications.},

These sensors are sensitive, portable, fast, inexpensive, and suitable for online and in-situ measurements compared to other methods. They can provide the detection for any compound that can undergo certain transformations within a potential window. It enables applications in multiple ion detection, mainly since these sensors are primarily non-specific. In this paper, we provide a survey of electrochemical sensors for the detection of water contaminants, i.e., pesticides, nitrate, nitrite, phosphorus, water hardeners, disinfectant, and other emergent contaminants (phenol, estrogen, gallic acid etc.). We focus on the influence of surface modification of the working electrodes by carbon nanomaterials, metallic nanostructures, imprinted polymers and evaluate the corresponding sensing performance. Especially for pesticides, which are challenging and need special care, we highlight biosensors, such as enzymatic sensors, immunobiosensor, aptasensors, and biomimetic sensors. We discuss the sensors' overall performance, especially concerning real-sample performance and the capability for actual field application.},

Using a sharpinterface scheme, capable of efficiently modeling the flow over complex surfaces, we perform 2D and 3D finite element simulations for a wide range of substrate wettabilities, i.e., from hydrophilic to superhydrophobic surfaces. Our results demonstrate that the contact angle hysteresis, due to the presence of the solid structures, is responsible for the appearance of a critical thermal gradient beyond which droplet migration is possible; the latter has been reported by experimental observations. The migration velocity as well as the direction of motion strongly depend on the combined action of the net mechanical force along the contact line and the thermocapillary induced flow at the liquid-air interface. We also show that through proper control and design of the substrate wettability, contact angle hysteresis, and induced flow field it is possible to manipulate the droplet dynamics: in particular, controlling its motion along a predefined track or entrapping by a wetting defect a droplet based on its size, as well as providing appropriate conditions for enhanced mixing inside the droplet.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the past and recent studies on thermocapillarity in relation to microfluidics. The role of thermocapillarity as the change of surface tension due to temperature gradient in developing Marangoni flow in liquid films and conclusively bubble and drop actuation is discussed. The thermocapillary-driven mass transfer (the so-called Benard-Marangoni effect) can be observed in liquid films, reservoirs, bubbles and droplets that are subject to the temperature gradient. Since the contribution of a surface tension-driven flow becomes more prominent when the scale becomes smaller as compared to a pressure-driven flow, microfluidic applications based on thermocapillary effect are gaining attentions recently. The effect of thermocapillarity on the flow pattern inside liquid films is the initial focus of this review. Analysis of the relation between evaporation and thermocapillary instability approves the effect of Marangoni flow on flow field inside the drop and its evaporation rate. The effect of thermocapillary on producing Marangoni flow inside drops and liquid films, leads to actuation of drops and bubbles due to the drag at the interface, mass conservation, and also gravity and buoyancy in vertical motion. This motion can happen inside microchannels with a closed multiphase medium, on the solid substrate as in solid/liquid interaction, or on top of a carrier liquid film in open microfluidic systems. Various thermocapillary-based microfluidic devices have been proposed and developed for different purposes such as actuation, sensing, trapping, sorting, mixing, chemical reaction, and biological assays throughout the years. A list of the thermocapillary based microfluidic devices along with their characteristics, configurations, limitations, and improvements are presented in this review.},

The screening of microfluidic synthesis processes is an urgent task of the experimental process in terms of automation and intellectualization. This study proposes a methodology and software for extracting the morphological and dynamic characteristics of generated monodisperse droplets from video data streams obtained from a digital microscope. For this purpose, the paper considers an approach to generating an extended feature space characterizing the process of droplet generation using a microfluidic device based on the creation of synthetic image datasets. YOLOv7 was used as an algorithm for detecting objects in the images. When training this algorithm, the values in the test dataset mAP@0.5 0.996 were obtained. The algorithms proposed for image processing and analysis implement the basic functionality to extract the morphological and dynamic characteristics of monodisperse droplets in the synthesis process. Laboratory validation and verification of the software demonstrated high results of the identification of key characteristics of the monodisperse droplets generated by the microfluidic device with the average deviation from the real values not exceeding 8\%.},

T-junction EWOD mixer device was designed using arrays of 50- m spaced square electrodes for mixing buffer reagent and analyte droplets. For fabrication of EWOD chips, 5- m thick silver EWOD electrodes were formed on a glass substrate by means of sputtering and lift-off process. PDMS and Teflon thin films were then coated on the electrodes by spin coating to yield hydrophobic surface. An external three-electrode system consisting of Au working, Ag reference and Pt auxiliary wires were installed over EWOD electrodes at the end of T-junction mixer. In experiment, a few-microliter droplets of Tris buffer and iodide solutions were moved toward the mixing junction and transported toward electrochemical electrodes by EWOD process. A short processing time within seconds was achieved at EWOD applied voltage of 300 V. The analyte droplets mixed with different concentrations were successfully analyzed by cyclic voltametry. Therefore, the combination of EWOD digital microfluidic and electrochemical sensing system has successfully been demonstrated for rapid chemical analysis with minimal reagent consumption.},

The limited ability to reproduce crucial features of the microenvironment, such as surrounding fluid flow and dynamic changes in biochemical stimuli, severely limits the types of experiments that can be carried out. Current equipment to achieve this, such as syringe and peristaltic pumps, is expensive, large, difficult to program and has limited potential for scalability. Here, we present a new pumping platform that is open-source, low-cost, modular, scalable, fully-programmable and easy to assemble that can be incorporated into cell culture systems to better recapitulate physiological environments. By controlling two commercially available piezoelectric pumps using a Raspberry Pi Zero microcontroller, the system is capable of producing arbitrary dynamic flow profiles with reliable flow rates ranging from 1 to 3000 mL/min as specified by an easily programmable Python-based script. We validated the accuracy of the flow rates, the use of time-varying profiles, and the practicality of the system by creating repeatable dynamic concentration profiles using a 3D-printed static micromixer.},

In this work, current input, analog voltage output integrator has been designed and simulations have been tested for biomedical imaging purpose. Researchers want to know photon accumulations in different phantom layers for photon measurement applications, especially for diffuse optical tomography (DOT) devices. In continuous wave (CW) DOT (CWDOT) measurements, there is no way to guess photon trajectories except running Monte Carlo (MC) simulations on computer. In time resolved (TR) biomedical optic imaging systems there are some ways to guess photon trajectories, but this modality is requiring very expensive laboratory situations such as dark room, optical table, photo-multiplier tubes (PMT), scientific camera systems, etc. In this work, one analog integrator circuit has been designed to use for CWDOT systems in the future. Electronic current measurement sensor will be one pn type semiconductor photo-detector. Photo-detector current is modelled by current-source in simulations. The circuit is one integrator at top. Integrator has one operational amplifier, integrating capacitance, and switching n-channel and p-channel metal-oxide silicon (MOS) field-effect transistors (MOSFET). The purpose of this work is to accomplish to acquire different depth layer photons by the pn-type photo-detector from tissue or tissue phantom. To acquire different depth layer photons, time difference circuit should be designed. Time differences between different acquisitions are important parameter to guess penetration depth of photon accumulations. Time difference will be done by drawing layout of time delay circuit, but not in this work. One micrometer conducting length difference is generating approximately five femtoseconds time delay in average CMOS technology for polysilisium and metal wires. One n-channel MOSFET transistor switch and one low-voltage threshold inverse connected depletion mode p-channel MOSFET transistor are connected cascade to photodetector for time delay purpose. Integrating pulse signals are triggering switching transistors over delay line wires.},

  abstract = {Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful measurement technique used by scientists and engineers to characterize and understand the interfacial behavior of liquid-solid interfaces. Such investigations are important in numerous applications and fields of research, including electrochemical synthesis and deposition of materials, such as metals and conducting polymers, corrosion protection analysis, investigation of molecule-surface interactions, and research on batteries and fuel cells. In recent years, advances in nanotechnology have led to a rise in the use of EIS in chemical and bio-sensing. Areas such as molecular diagnostics and healthcare can greatly benefit from this novel technology, which includes low-cost, rapid response measurements that can be done by non-experts at the point of care. For new entrants, the depth of knowledge and breadth of EIS and its many applications can be rather daunting. This article therefore serves as a tutorial on basic EIS theory, whilst highlighting new applications in advanced bio-sensing. The tutorial begins with a theoretical overview, including electrical AC impedance, formation and structure of electrical double layers at liquid solid-interfaces and equivalent circuit models used to represent interfacial phenomena. This is followed by an introduction to bio-sensing and a review of recent research highlights on resistive and capacitive biosensors based on nanogap electrodes, especially those having novel applications from DNA detection to nanoparticle capturing. Lastly, the article highlights a recent new breakthrough on how the combination of nanogap electrodes with label-free methods, such as aptamer functionalized surfaces, can make capacitive sensors with extremely high sensitivity and specificity.},

  abstract = {The emerging technology of digital microfluidics is opening up the possibility of performing radiochemistry at the microliter scale to produce tracers for positron emission tomography (PET) labeled with fluorine-18 or other isotopes. Working at this volume scale not only reduces reagent costs but also improves specific activity (SA) by reducing contamination by the stable isotope. This technology could provide a practical means to routinely prepare high-SA tracers for applications such as neuroimaging and could make it possible to routinely achieve high SA using synthesis strategies such as isotopic exchange. Reagent droplets are controlled electronically, providing high reliability, a compact control system, and flexibility for diverse syntheses with a single-chip design. The compact size may enable the development of a self-shielded synthesizer that does not require a hot cell. This article reviews the progress of this technology and its application to the synthesis of PET tracers.},

Rapid advances in developing and implementing such sensors in the last several years have demonstrated the growing significance and potential utility of this unique class of sensing platforms. Applications include wearable consumer electronics, soft robotics, medical prosthetics, electronic skin, and health monitoring. In this review, we provide a state-of-the-art overview of the emerging flexible and wearable sensing platforms for healthcare and biomedical applications. We first introduce the selection of flexible and stretchable materials and the fabrication of sensors based on these materials. We then compare the different solid-state and liquid-state physical sensing platforms and examine the mechanical deformation-based working mechanisms of these sensors. We also highlight some of the exciting applications of flexible and wearable physical sensors in emerging healthcare and biomedical applications, in particular for artificial electronic skins, physiological health monitoring and assessment, and therapeutic and drug delivery. Finally, we conclude this review by offering some insight into the challenges and opportunities facing this field.},

The current study advances accuracy of numerical modeling of electrowetting by considering dynamic behavior of the triphase contact line using molecular-kinetic theory. This theory in conjunction with volume of fluid method, which has been proved to be a powerful approach for free surface modeling, is used to simulate the phenomenon. By comparing the results against experimental data from literature, the simulation demonstrates significant improvement in results. It is concluded that ignoring dynamic features of wetting leads to overestimation of the effect of electrowetting actuation on various parameters including contact angle, aspect ratio and velocity of the droplet.},

In this work, we present a one-pass synthesis scheme which directly realizes the desired functionality onto the chip and, at the same time, guarantees minimality with respect to area and/or timing. For this purpose, the deductive power of solvers for Boolean satisfiability is exploited. Experiments show how the approach leverages the design of the respective devices.},

Their design is usually conducted in several stages with routing being a particularly critical challenge. Previously proposed solutions for this design step suffer from two issues: They are mainly of heuristic nature and usually assume that the blockages to be bypassed are present the entire time. In contrast, we present a methodology which exploits the fact that blockages are often only present at certain intervals. At the same time, our approach guarantees exact solutions, i.e. always determines a routing with a minimal number of time steps. Experimental results show that, despite the huge complexity, optimal results can be achieved in reasonable run-time and that the consideration of temporary blockages indeed significantly improves the routing results.},

During the design and use of these devices, droplet routing represents a particularly critical challenge. Here, various design tasks have to be addressed for which, depending on the corresponding scenario, different solutions are available. However, all these developments eventually result in an ``inflation'' of different design approaches for routing of DMFBs -- many of them addressing a very dedicated routing task only. In this work, we propose a comprehensive routing methodology which (1) provides one (generic) solution capable of addressing a variety of different design tasks, (2) employs a ``push-button''-scheme that requires no (manual) composition of partial results, and (3) guarantees minimality e.g., with respect to the number of timesteps or the number of required control pins. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the benefits of the solution, i.e., the applicability for a wide range of design tasks as well as improvements compared to specialized solutions presented in the past.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting has the potential to be applied to steering and concentrating sunlight using liquid lenses. However, the performance of electrowetting devices depends on the careful selection/ fabrication of their constituent dielectric material. The dielectric material should have high optical transparency, chemical stability, high relative permittivity, be relatively thin and have a high breakdown voltage. Recent studies noted that inorganic dielectric materials such as SiO2 are more suitable for beam steering compared to organic dielectric materials such as fluoropolymers or parylene C for example. When optical transmission is not required, electrowetting devices are fabricated by thermally growing SiO2 on top of silicon wafers. However, this deposition method is not suitable for beam steering electrowetting devices as the silicon substrate is not optically transparent. In this paper, we investigated the performance of SiO2 as a dielectric material for beam steering electrowetting devices. Specifically, we measured the contact angle modulation capability of SiO2 produced by electron-beam and sputtering deposition methods and correlated the results with morphological defects of the SiO2 layer introduced by the deposition methods. We investigated the effect of annealing and the performance with ionic and DI water. Finally, we compared the performance of SiO2 with other dielectric materials such as PDMS and Ta2O5 in air/water and silicone oil/water medium.},

The XRD studies illustrated the amorphous and crystalline nature of PPy and PPy/V2O5 composites, respectively. The electrochemical ammonia sensing behavior of the synthesized materials was evaluated using LCR-meter. The sensitivity of the materials towards ammonia was studied with respect to V2O5 content in the composites, temperature and ammonia concentration. Among the studied materials, PPy/V2O5 composite with 8 wt.\% of V2O5 showed best sensitivity response toward ammonia at 25 {$^\circ$}C in the range of 5--200 ppm with limit of detection of 1.4 ppm. The sensitivity, response and recovery times of PPy/8 wt.\%V2O5 determined from dynamic response curve at 10 ppm ammonia were 19.5\%, 10.5 and 81.6 s, respectively. The highly selective ammonia sensing performance of PPy/V2O5 composites may be due the incorporation of V2O5 in PPy and could be declared as a promising candidate for sensitive gas sensors.},

The four IDC taste sensing elements of the array are fabricated by incorporating four different types of lipids into the polymer, dioctyl phenylphosphonate (DOPP) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) to make the respective dielectric materials that are individually placed onto an interdigitated electrode (IDE) via spin coating. When the dielectric material of an IDC sensing element comes into contact with a taste substance, its dielectric properties change with the capacitance of the IDC sensing element; this, in turn, changes the voltage across the IDC, as well as the output voltage of each channel of the system. In order to assess the effectiveness of the sensing system, four taste substances, namely sourness (HCl), saltiness (NaCl), sweetness (glucose) and bitterness (quinine-HCl), were tested. The IDC taste sensor array had rapid response and recovery times of about 12.9 s and 13.39 s, respectively, with highly stable response properties. The response property of the proposed IDC taste sensor array was linear, and its correlation coefficient R2 was about 0.9958 over the dynamic range of the taste sensor array as the taste substance concentration was varied from 1 {$\mu$}M to 1 M. The proposed IDC taste sensor array has several other advantages, such as real-time monitoring capabilities, high sensitivity 45.78 mV/decade, good reproducibility with a standard deviation of about 0.029 and compactness, and the circuitry is based on readily available and inexpensive electronic components. The proposed IDC taste sensor array was compared with the potentiometric taste sensor with respect to sensitivity, dynamic range width, linearity and response time. We found that the proposed IDC sensor array has better performance. Finally, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to discriminate different types of taste of the mixed taste substances.},

  abstract = {The ability to manipulate a liquid meniscus using electrowetting has many applications. In any electrowetting design, at least two electrodes are required: one forms the field to change the contact angle and the other functions as a ground electrode. The contribution of the ground electrode (GE) to the dynamics of electrowetting has not yet been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we discovered that with a bare ground electrode, the contact angle of a sessile drop increases instead of decreases when a direct current (DC) voltage varying from zero to the threshold voltage is applied. This phenomenon is opposite to what occurs when the GE is coated with a dielectric, where the contact-angle change follows the Lippmann--Young equation above the threshold voltage of electrowetting. However, this behaviour is not observed with either a dielectric-coated electrode using direct current (DC) or a bare ground electrode using alternating current (AC) voltage electrowetting. This study explains this phenomenon with finite element simulation and theory. From previous research work, the ground electrode configuration is inconsistent. In some studies, the ground electrode is exposed to water; in other studies, the ground electrode is covered with dielectric. This study identified that an exposed ground electrode is not required in electrowetting. Moreover, this research work suggests that for applications where precise control of the contact angle is paramount, a dielectric-coated ground electrode should be used since it prevents the increase in the contact angle when increasing the applied potential from zero to the threshold voltage. This study also identified that contact angle hysteresis is lower with a Cytop-coated ground electrode and DC voltage than with a bare ground electrode using AC or DC voltages.},

A DMF device is a liquid-droplets-handling platform with varied applications in the fields of medical diagnostics, drug discovery, chemical analysis, environmental monitoring, and basic scientific research. These operations can be performed in a rapid, low-cost, portable, and reliable environment using DMF devices. Two of the important elements of DMF devices are electro-wetting on dielectric phenomenon and hydrophobicity. Under an applied voltage of either AC or DC, the electro-wetting effect induces a reduction in the contact angle of the droplet with the hydrophobic surface. This enables manipulation of motion and position of droplets on the hydrophobic surface. In this work, the actuation of droplets on an open DMF device with a single array of electrodes is carried out. The fabrication of DMF plate is carried out on a copper covered plate by patterning using black tapes and etching using etchants. The circuit is arranged using PCB, jumper wires, 8-channel relay, 9V battery, acpower regulator and a microcontroller (Arduino/Genuino UNO).},

  abstract = {Abstract             Characterizing the thermal behavior of dispersed droplets within microfluidic channels is crucial for different applications in lab-on-a-chip. In this paper, the physics of droplets volume during their transport over a heater is studied experimentally and numerically. The response of droplets to external heating is examined at temperature ranges of 25--90\,{$^\circ$}C and at different flow rates of the dispersed phase respect to the continuous flow. The results present a reliable prediction of the droplet volume and stability when heating is applied to the droplets at the downstream channel in a quite far distance from the droplets' ejection orifice. Increasing the ratio of flow rate resulted in larger droplets; for instance, the flow ratio of 0.25 produced drops with 40\% larger diameter than the flow rate of 0.1. For every 10\,{$^\circ$}C increase in temperature of the droplets, the droplet diameter increased by about 5.7\% and 4.2\% for pure oil and oil with a surfactant, respectively. Also, the droplets showed a degree of instability during their transport over the heater at higher temperatures. Adding SPAN 20 surfactant improved the stability of the droplets at temperatures higher than 60\,{$^\circ$}C. The experimentally validated numerical model helped for systemic analysis of the influence of key temperature-dependence parameters (e.g. surface tension, density and viscosity of both phases) on controlling the volume and stability of droplets. Our findings supported to develop highly functional systems with a predetermined droplets performance under high temperatures up to 90\,{$^\circ$}C. This report provides a preliminary basis for enhancing the performance of droplet microfluidic systems for digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR), continuous flow digital loop-mediated isothermal PCR (LAMP), and droplet-based antibiotic susceptibility testing.},

Droplets generated in microfluidics can perform multiple functions by either changing the reaction conditions within each droplet or doing the same reactions in parallel, series, or combinations. These reactions mostly require precise control of droplet temperature using contact or non-contact heating sources, including optical-, electrical-, mechanical- and acoustic-based heating techniques. This work exclusively presents thermal energy sources in microfluidics and provides insights into the physical interpretation of thermal actuation of microdroplets. It then highlights advances in thermal droplet microfluidics for biomedical, chemical and engineering applications. The biomedical applications include biosensing, drug discovery, drug testing, and antibiotic susceptibility testing. The chemical applications include synthesis of microgel droplets and Janus particles. The engineering applications include an overview of thermal manipulation of the generated droplets and employing emulsified droplets in thermal management and cooling applications. This review supports the development of new methods to meet different demands arising from these applications. Finally, the challenges involved in the widespread use of thermal microdevices are discussed and further considerations for prospective research in this area are highlighted.},

However, notably, much of the research into molecular self-assembly has been performed using conventional bulk techniques where the resultant species are dictated by thermodynamic stability to yield relatively simple assemblies. Whereas, the environmental control offered by microfluidic systems offers methods to achieve non-equilibrium reaction conditions capable of increasingly sophisticated self-assembled structures. Alterations to the immediate microenvironment during the assembly of the molecules is possible, providing the basis for kinetically-controlled assembly. This review examines the key mechanism offered by microfluidic systems and the architectures required to access them. The mechanisms include diffusion-led mixing, shear gradient alignment, spatial and temporal confinement, and structural templates in multiphase systems.

Limit of detection values for phosphate and ammonium were 0.18 and 0.27 mg L-1, respectively. The developed system provides a good precision with relative standard deviations of 2.9 and 4.1\% for 11 replicated injections of 1 mg P L-1 and 2 mg N L-1, respectively. Percent recoveries of the analysis of phosphate and ammonium were obtained in the range of 93.5--109.4 and 92.4--107.0, respectively.

A novel capillary interface enables highly repeatable transfer of liquid between the DMF device and the external fluidic modules, allowing both continuous-flow and droplet-based sample manipulations to be performed in one integrated system. Here, we highlight the utility of the DMF hub platform and capillary interface for automating two key operations in the NGS sample preparation workflow. Using an in-line contactless conductivity detector in conjunction with the capillary interface, we demonstrate closed-loop automated fraction collection of target analytes from a continuous-flow sample stream into droplets on the DMF device. Buffer exchange and sample cleanup, the most repeated steps in NGS library preparation, are also demonstrated on the DMF platform using a magnetic bead assay and achieving an average DNA recovery efficiency of 80\% {\textpm} 4.8\%.},

  abstract = {Soft artificial skin sensors that can detect contact forces as well as their locations are attractive in various soft robotics applications. However, soft sensors made of polymer materials have inherent limitations of hysteresis and nonlinearity in response, which makes it highly difficult to implement traditional calibration techniques and yields poor estimation performance. In this paper, we propose intelligent algorithms based on machine learning and logics that can improve the performance of soft sensors. The proposed methods in this paper could be solutions to the aforementioned long-standing problems. They can also be used to simplify the system complexity by reducing the number of signal wires. Three machine learning techniques are discussed in this paper: an artificial neural network (ANN), the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm, and a recurrent neural network (RNN). The Preisach model of hysteresis and simple logics were used to support these algorithms. We proved that classifying contact locations on a soft sensor is possible using simple algorithms in real time. Also, force estimation of a single contact was possible using an ANN with the Preisach method. Finally, we successfully estimated forces of multiple contact locations by predicting the outputs of mixed RNN results.},

Given its straightforward operation mechanism, low cost, and ease of system construction, it has gained traction as a versatile and potential strategy for the realistic establishment of lab-on-a-chip (LOC) in various engineering applications. We present a CCEP-based digital microfluidics (DMF) platform with two parallel electrode modules comprising assembled conventional pin header sockets, allowing for efficient mixing through horizontal and vertical shaking via droplet reciprocating motions. The temporal chromic change caused by the chemical reaction between the pH indicator and base solutions within the shaking droplets is quantitatively analyzed under various CCEP actuation conditions to evaluate the mixing performance in shaking droplets by vertical and horizontal reciprocating motions on the DMF platform. Furthermore, mixing flow patterns within shaking droplets are successfully visualized by a high-speed camera system. The suggested techniques can mix samples and reagents rapidly and efficiently in droplet-based microreactors for DMF applications, such as biochemical analysis and medical diagnostics.},

Here, we present a novel approach for high throughput single cell arraying by integrating two original microfluidic devices: an acoustofluidic chip and an electroactive microwell array. The velocity of the cells is geared down in the acoustofluidic chip while maintaining a high volume flow rate at the inlet of the microsystem, and the cells are subsequently trapped one by one into the microwell array using dielectrophoresis. The integrated system exhibited a 10 times improved sample throughput compared to trapping with the electroactive microwell array chip alone, while maintaining a highly efficient cell recovery above 90\%. The results indicate that the serial integration of the acoustophoretic pre-concentration with the dielectrophoretic cell trapping drastically improves the performance of the electroactive microwell array for highly efficient single cell analysis. This simple and effective system for high throughput single cell arraying with further possible integration of additional functions, including cell sorting and downstream analysis after cell trapping, has potential for development to a highly integrated and automated platform for single-cell analysis of rare cells.},

The electrical characteristics of the devices were simulated by using the Synopsys Sentaurus technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulation tool, and we compared the conventional SJBT with SJBT with separated n-buffer layers. The simulation tool result shows that turn-off loss (Eoff) drops by about 7\% when on-state voltage (Von) and breakdown voltage (BV) are similar. Von increases by about 0.5\% and BV decreases by only about 0.8\%.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we proposed an integrated microfluidic device that could demonstrate the non-contact, label-free separation of particles and cells through the combination of inertial microfluidics and acoustophoresis. The proposed device integrated two microfluidic chips which were a PDMS channel chip on top of the silicon-based acoustofluidic chip. The PDMS chip worked by prefocusing the particles/cells through inducing the inertial force of the channel structure. The connected acoustofluidic chips separated particles based on their size through an acoustic radiation force. In the serpentine-shaped PDMS chip, particles formed two lines focusing in the channel, and a trifugal-shaped acoustofluidic chip displaced and separated particles, in which larger particles focused on the central channel and smaller ones moved to the side channels. The simultaneous fluidic works allowed high-efficiency particle separation. Using this novel acoustofluidic device with an inertial microchannel, the separation of particles and cells based on their size was presented and analyzed, and the efficiency of the device was shown. The device demonstrated excellent separation performance with a high recovery ratio (up to 96.3\%), separation efficiency (up to 99\%), and high volume rate ({$>$}100 {\textmu}L/min). Our results showed that integrated devices could be a viable alternative to current cell separation based on their low cost, reduced sample consumption and high throughput capability.},

Quantum dot nanoparticles were used to detect Salmonella cells. For selective detection of Salmonella, anti-Salmonella polyclonal antibodies were covalently immobilized onto the quantum dot surface. To separate and concentrate the cells from the sample, superparamagnetic particles and a microfluidic chip were used. A portable fluorometer was developed to measure the fluorescence signal from the quantum dot nanoparticles attached to Salmonella in the samples. The sensitivity for detection of pathogenic Salmonella was evaluated using serially diluted Salmonella Typhimurium in borate buffer and chicken extract. The fluorescence response of the nano-biosensor increased with increasing cell concentration. The detection limit of the sensor was 103 CFU/mL Salmonella in both borate buffer and food extract.},

Mainstream techniques used in microalgal research are based on conventional cell culture and cell handling systems, which are bulky, labor-intensive, time-consuming, and also limited in throughput. Microfluidic lab-on-a-chip systems can offer cost- and time-efficient alternatives to advance microalgal biofuel and bioproduction research by providing high precision and high efficiency cell/reagent handling capabilities, enabling high-throughput assays in a fully automated fashion.

Mixing droplets without a top cover plate is important for bio-chemical analysis. For this reason, a more efficient mixing method is required especially for mixing a viscous liquid droplet in an open surface. Here, to improve the performance of droplet mixing, we propose the integration of an acoustically oscillating bubble to an electrowettingon-dielectric (EWOD) chip, which can generate microstreaming inside the droplet. Firstly, an EWOD chip integrated with through-holes for bubble trapping was designed and fabricated through PCB fabrication. This PCB manufacturing technology helps to place more electrodes in the limited chip size. Secondly, we developed the custom-made circuit and interface to individually control multiple actuators (including EWOD actuation and acoustic excitation). Finally, an operation test was conducted to evaluate the capability of not only droplet transportation but also mixing on an open surface. The proposed PCB-based DMF platform for bubble-induced droplet mixing was experimentally verified and expected to make DMF chips more efficient when used for clinical point-of-care diagnostic applications.},

Identifying the latest trends in single-cell trapping technologies afford opportunities such as new structural design and combination with other technologies. This will lead to more advanced applications towards improving measurement sensitivity to the desired target. In this review, we examined the basic principles of impedance sensors and their applications in various biological fields. In the next step, we introduced the latest trend of microfluidic chip technology for trapping single cells and summarized the important findings on the characteristics of single cells in impedance biosensor systems that successfully trapped single cells. This is expected to be used as a leading technology in cell biology, pathology, and pharmacological fields, promoting the further understanding of complex functions and mechanisms within individual cells with numerous data sampling and accurate analysis capabilities.},

  abstract = {Mass spectrometry (MS) has become an indispensable tool for laboratory science, but a drawback is the laborious sample processing required before MS analysis. Digital microfluidics (DMF), a microscale liquid handling technique characterized by the manipulation of fluid droplets on open electrode arrays, presents a potential solution to this problem. In DMF, discrete droplets can be made to merge, mix, split, and dispense from reservoirs. Since droplets are manipulated individually and act as discrete microreactors, DMF is well suited for microscale sample processing. Coupling the versatility of MS analysis with DMF sample handling has been beneficial for a number of DMF-based applications, including proteomics, chemical synthesis, and clinical diagnostics. In this review, we provide a summary of efforts to integrate these two technologies, focusing on examples of both off-line and in-line MS analysis for DMF sample processing.},

  abstract = {In the modern world, almost all electromechanical systems use sensors to acquire pertinent information from the environment during operation or to operate more effectively. In many of these applications, there is demand for increased performance along with decreased size and cost of sensor technology. Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) are an attractive option to fill this demand due to the small resolution of feature sizes ({$\approx$} 1{\textmu}m) and the ease of mass-production due to compliance with standard microfabrication processes. Within MEMS, surface acoustic wave sensors (SAWS) offer a particularly interesting sensor option due to the wide variety of measurable phenomena---from temperature to biological agents to magnetic field strength---and potential applications---ranging from individual sensors with additional packaging to large-scale, distributed sensor networks. In this paper, we shall explore the design process of a surface acoustic wave sensor both to gain understanding of the range of the design space of surface acoustic wave devices and how to design a SAWS with selected properties for use in a chosen application.},

  abstract = {The opportunity for the commercialization of microfluidic systems has surged over the recent decade, primarily for medical and the life science applications. This positive development has been spurred by an increasing number of integrated, highly functional lab-on-a-chip technologies from the research community. Toward commercialization, there is a dire need for economic manufacture which involves optimized cost for materials and structuring on the front-end as well as for a range of back-end processing steps such as surface modification, integration of functional elements, assembly and packaging. Front-end processing can readily resort to very well established polymer mass fabrication schemes, e.g. injection molding. Also assembly and packaging can often be adopted from commercially available processes. In this review, we survey the back-end processes of hybrid material integration and surface modification which often need to be tailored to the specifics of miniaturized polymeric microfluidic systems. On the one hand, the accurate control of these back-end processes proves to be the key to the technical function of the system and thus the value creation. On the other hand, the integration of functional materials constitutes a major cost factor.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidics (DMF) has emerged as a promising liquid handling technology for a variety of applications, demonstrating great potential both in terms of miniaturization and automation. DMF is based on the manipulation of discrete, independently controllable liquid droplets, which makes it highly reconfigurable and reprogrammable. One of its most exclusive advantages, compared to microchannel-based microfluidics, is its ability to precisely handle solid nano- and microsized objects, such as magnetic particles. Magnetic particles have become very popular in the last decade, since their high surface-to-volume ratio and the possibility to magnetically separate them from the matrix make them perfect suitable as a solid support for bio-assay development. The potential of magnetic particles in DMF-based bio-assays has been demonstrated for various applications. In this review we discuss the latest developments of magnetic particle-based DMF bio-assays with the aim to present, identify and analyze the trends in the field. We also discuss the state-of-the art of device integration, current status of commercialization and issues that still need to be addressed. With this paper we intend to stimulate researchers to exploit and unveil the potential of these exciting tools, which will shape the future of modern biochemistry, microbiology and biomedical diagnostics.},

Absolute quantification by ddPCR was then further developed to identify E. coli O157:H7 and S. Typhimurium targeting the single copy genes Z3276 and invA, respectively. Apple juice, milk and chicken were selected as corresponding represents of fruit, dairy and meat, to investigate the application of ddPCR in different food. The tested microbial communities were all successfully annotated by NGS at the level of species, and the accuracy of absolute abundance calculated by NGS + ddPCR relied on its initial population for each species. When detecting the genes Z3276 and invA simultaneously by dual channels using ddPCR, the detection limit of E. coli O157:H7 and S.

Here, we propose a method for selective control of individual droplets, which allows different conditions for individual droplet pairs. Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) technology is introduced to control the height of the droplets so that the contact between droplet-pairs can be individually controlled. Circular patterns 4~mm in diameter composed of electrodes for EWOD and hydrophilic--hydrophobic patterns for droplet formation 4~{$\mu$}l in volume were developed. We demonstrate the selective control of the droplet height by EWOD for an applied voltage up to 160~V and selective control of the contact and transport of substances. Presented results will provide useful method for advanced drug screening, including cell-based screening.},

  abstract = {Applications in chemistry, biology, medicine, and engineering require the large-scale manipulation of a wide range of chemicals, samples, and specimens. To achieve maximum efficiency, parallel control of microlitre droplets using automated techniques is essential. Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD), which manipulates droplets using the imbalance of wetting on a substrate, is the most widely employed method. However, EWOD is limited in its capability to make droplets detach from the substrate (jumping), which hinders throughput and device integration. Here, we propose a novel microfluidic system based on focused ultrasound passing through a hydrophobic mesh with droplets resting on top. A phased array dynamically creates foci to manipulate droplets of up to 300 {$\mu$}L. This platform offers a jump height of up to 10 cm, a 27-fold improvement over conventional EWOD systems. In addition, droplets can be merged or split by pushing them against a hydrophobic knife. We demonstrate Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling using our platform, showing its potential for a wide range of chemical experiments. Biofouling in our system was lower than in conventional EWOD, demonstrating its high suitability for biological experiments. Focused ultrasound allows the manipulation of both solid and liquid targets. Our platform provides a foundation for the advancement of micro-robotics, additive manufacturing, and laboratory automation.},

This paper reviews {\textmu}/n-IDEA as working electrodes in four-electrode electrochemical sensors in terms of two-dimensional (2D) planar IDEA and three-dimensional (3D) IDEA configurations using carbon or metal as the starting materials. In this regard, the enhancement of IDEAs-based biosensors focuses on controlling the width and gap measurements between the adjacent fingers and increases the IDEA's height. Several distinctive methods used to expand the surface area of 3D IDEAs, such as a unique 3D IDEA design, integration of mesh, microchannel, vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNT), and nanoparticles, are demonstrated and discussed. More notably, the conventional four-electrode system, consisting of reference and counter electrodes will be compared to the highly novel two-electrode system that adopts IDEA's shape. Compared to the 2D planar IDEA, the expansion of the surface area in 3D IDEAs demonstrated significant changes in the performance of electrochemical sensors. Furthermore, the challenges faced by current IDEAs-based electrochemical biosensors and their potential solutions for future directions are presented herein.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidics (DMF) is a liquid handling technique that has been demonstrated to automate biological experimentation in a low-cost, rapid, and programmable manner. This review discusses the role of DMF as a ``digital bioconverter''---a tool to connect the digital aspects of the design--build--learn cycle with the physical execution of experiments. Several applications are reviewed to demonstrate the utility of DMF as a digital bioconverter, namely, genetic engineering, sample preparation for sequencing and mass spectrometry, and enzyme-, immuno-, and cell-based screening assays. These applications show that DMF has great potential in the role of a centralized execution platform in a fully integrated pipeline for the production of novel organisms and biomolecules. In this paper, we discuss how the function of a DMF device within such a pipeline is highly dependent on integration with different sensing techniques and methodologies from machine learning and big data. In addition to that, we examine how the capacity of DMF can in some cases be limited by known technical and operational challenges and how consolidated efforts in overcoming these challenges will be key to the development of DMF as a major enabling technology in the computer-aided biology framework.},

  abstract = {An electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) sensor design is proposed based on a standard interdigitated electrode layout in which the smaller working electrode consists of gold (Au) whereas the larger combined counter and reference electrode is coated with a porous layer of polypyrrole (PPy) doped with polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) (PPy:PSS). Each electrode material was first characterized by EIS in a standard 3-electrode setup with subsequent spectra fitting by a modified Randles equivalent circuit. The differences in the spectra obtained by the PPy:PSS coated electrodes can be explained by an increased electroactive surface area due to the porous polymer film. The changes in morphology of the film are discussed with respect to the evolution of the elements of the electric equivalent circuit. When applying the Au/PPy:PSS electrode combination to a standard 2-electrode arrangement, the enlarged highly electroactive surface area of the PPy:PSS coating lowers the interfacial impedance in a way that mainly the gold working electrode contributes to the overall system impedance. Therefore, obtaining reproducible EIS signals depends only on the electrode's open-circuit potential (OCP) and on additional adsorption events at the gold electrode/electrolyte interface. We present a protocol for microelectrode coating with PPy:PSS, which enables highly stable 2-electrode EIS experiments without the need of a reference electrode. This combination is believed to be very useful if an integration of sensing electrodes inside Micro Total Analysis Systems is aspired.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting-on-dielectric is a decent technique to manipulate discrete volumes of liquid in form of droplets. In the last decade, electrowetting-on-dielectric systems, also called digital microfluidic systems, became more frequently used for a variety of applications because of their high flexibility and reconfigurability. Thus, one design can be adapted to different assays by only reprogramming. However, this flexibility can only be useful if the entire system is portable and easy to use. This paper presents the development of a portable, standalone digital microfluidic system based on a Linux-based operating system running on a Raspberry Pi, which is unique. We present ``PortaDrop'' exhibiting the following key features: (1) an ``all-in-one box'' approach, (2) a user-friendly, self-explaining graphical user interface and easy handling, (3) the ability of integrated electrochemical measurements, (4) the ease to implement additional lab equipment via Universal Serial Bus and the General Purpose Interface Bus as well as (5) a standardized experiment documentation. We propose that PortaDrop can be used to carry out experiments in different applications, where small sample volumes in the nanoliter to picoliter range need to be handled an analyzed automatically. As a first application, we present a protocol, where a droplet is consequently exchanged by droplets of another medium using passive dispensing. The exchange is monitored by electrical impedance spectroscopy. It is the first time, the media exchange caused by passive dispensing is characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Summarizing, PortaDrop allows easy combination of fluid handling by means of electrowetting and additional sensing.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a protocol using theoretical methods and free software to design and analyze multivolume digital PCR (MV digital PCR) devices; the theory and software are also applicable to design and analysis of dilution series in digital PCR. MV digital PCR minimizes the total number of wells required for ``digital'' (single molecule) measurements while maintaining high dynamic range and high resolution. In some examples, multivolume designs with fewer than 200 total wells are predicted to provide dynamic range with 5-fold resolution similar to that of single-volume designs requiring 12 000 wells. Mathematical techniques were utilized and expanded to maximize the information obtained from each experiment and to quantify performance of devices and were experimentally validated using the SlipChip platform. MV digital PCR was demonstrated to perform reliably, and results from wells of different volumes agreed with one another. No artifacts due to different surface-to-volume ratios were observed, and single molecule amplification in volumes ranging from 1 to 125 nL was self-consistent. The device presented here was designed to meet the testing requirements for measuring clinically relevant levels of HIV viral load at the point-of-care (in plasma, {$<$}500 molecules/mL to {$>$}1 000 000 molecules/ mL), and the predicted resolution and dynamic range was experimentally validated using a control sequence of DNA. This approach simplifies digital PCR experiments, saves space, and thus enables multiplexing using separate areas for each sample on one chip, and facilitates the development of new high-performance diagnostic tools for resource-limited applications. The theory and software presented here are general and are applicable to designing and analyzing other digital analytical platforms including digital immunoassays and digital bacterial analysis. It is not limited to SlipChip and could also be useful for the design of systems on platforms including valve-based and droplet-based platforms. In a separate publication by Shen et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2011, DOI: 10.1021/ja2060116), this approach is used to design and test digital RT-PCR devices for quantifying RNA.},

The precision of the fabrication was validated by surface topography using scanning electron microscopy, high power microscopy, 3D-nano profilometry, and atomic force microscopy. These AIDEs were fabricated with a tolerance of {\textpm} 6 nm in dimensions. The insignificant current variation at the pico-ampere range for all bare AIDEs further proved the reproducibility of the device. The large gap sized AIDE (D1) is insensitive to acidic medium, whereas D2 and D3 are insensitive to alkali medium. D2 was the best with regard to its electrical characterization. Furthermore, uniformly synthesized molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) nanoparticles prepared with human blood clotting factor IX and its aptamer were in the size range 140 to 160 nm, attached on the sensing surface and characterized. The average thickness of deposited MIP film was 1.7 {$\mu$}m. EDX data shows the prominent peaks for silicon and aluminum substrates as 61.79 and 22.52\%, respectively. The MIP nanoparticles-deposited sensor surface was characterized by applying it in electrolyte solutions, and smooth curves with the current flow were observed at pH lower than 8 and discriminated against alkali media. This study provides a new MIP amalgamated AIDE with nano-gapped fingers enabling analysis of other biomaterials due to its operation in an ideal buffer range.},

Water quality sensors are needed in order to quantify the problem and verify the success of remedial actions. This review summarizes the most common chemical water quality parameters, and current developments in sensor technology available to monitor them. Particular emphasis is on technologies that lend themselves to reagent-free, low-maintenance, autonomous and continuous monitoring. Chemiresistors and other electrical sensors are discussed in particular detail, while mechanical, optical and electrochemical sensors also find mentioning. The focus here is on the physics of chemical signal transduction in sensor elements that are in direct contact with the analyte. All other sensing methods, and all other elements of sampling, sample pre-treatment as well as the collection, transmission and analysis of the data are not discussed here. Instead, the goal is to highlight the progress and remaining challenges in the development of sensor materials and designs for an audience of physicists and materials scientists.},

This assay platform combines two digital approaches. First, digital microfluidic manipulation of droplets which serve as micro-reaction chambers and shuttling magnetic particles between these droplets facilitates the integration of complex solid phase multistep assays. We demonstrate an optimized novel particle extraction and transfer protocol for superparamagnetic particles on a digital microfluidic chip that allows for nearly 100\% extraction efficiencies securing high assay performance. Second, the compartmentalization required for digital single molecule detection is solved by simple molecular biological means, circumventing the need for complex microfabrication procedures necessary for most, if not all, other digital nucleic acid detection methods. For that purpose, padlock probes are circularized in a strictly target dependent ligation reaction and amplified through two rounds of rolling circle amplification, including an intermediate digestion step. The reaction results in hundreds of 500 nm sized individually countable DNA nanospheres per detected target molecule. We demonstrate that integrated miniaturized digital microfluidic C2CA results in equally high numbers of C2CA products {$\mu$}L               -1               as off-chip tube control experiments indicating high assay performance without signal loss. As low as 1 aM synthetic               Pseudomonas aeruginosa               DNA was detected with a linear dynamic range over 4 orders of magnitude up to 10 fM proving excellent suitability for infectious disease diagnostics.},

  abstract = {A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a method typically active in genetic research, especially to amplify or copy genes. Herein, the application of microfluidic devices for nucleic acid amplification has recently been extensively and vigorously studied and implemented. However, the existing classical instruments are hefty, excessive thermal loss, more power consumption, laborious, and require more execution time. Further, it is hard to establish a platform to integrate, automate, and miniaturize the microdevice on a solo stage for testing and analyzing. There has been substantial innovation in the development of continuous-flow based microfluidic PCR micro-devices in the last few decades because of their widespread applications. The continuous-flow microfluidic PCR microdevice enables several features like compact device, portability, repeatability, miniaturization, and integration with a marginal sample reaction volume. It also permits rapid testing and identification of the genetic sample with high-throughput and increased efficiency and output stability of the microdevice by using minimum accessories for its operation. In this review, the recent trends towards the advancement and miniaturization of the assessments using PCR technique with many distinct novel based microchannel designs, fabrication and bonding method, and other associated approaches in the development of continuous-flow based microfluidic PCR devices for the quantification and detection of the nucleic acids.

Microfluidics technology harnesses the fluid mechanics to generate nanoparticles with a unique size and finely controllable shape that can be used for various applications like drug delivery, biological sciences, healthcare, and food industries. The nanoparticles are generally distinguished from fine particles to coarse particles due to their smaller size and unique material properties like chemical, physical, biological, and optical. However, the conventional methods require bulky instruments, expensive autoclaves, consume more power, high thermal loss, and require more time for the synthesis. Further, it is very challenging to automate, integrate, and miniaturize the conventional device on a single platform for synthesizing micro-and nanoscale particles. There has been considerable advancement in the development of microfluidic devices in the last few years for nanoparticle synthesis. The microfluidic device unveils several features such as portability, transparency in operation, controllability, and stability with a marginal reaction volume. The microfluidic-based nanoparticle synthesis also allows rapid processing and increased efficiency of the technique by using minimum peripherals for its operation.

  abstract = {Using pathogen-infected food that can be unhygienic can result in severe diseases and an increase in mortality rate among humans. This may arise as a serious emergency problem if not appropriately restricted at this point of time. Thus, food science researchers are concerned with precaution, prevention, perception, and immunity to pathogenic bacteria. Expensive, elongated assessment time and the need for skilled personnel are some of the shortcomings of the existing conventional methods. Developing and investigating a rapid, low-cost, handy, miniature, and effective detection technology for pathogens is indispensable. In recent times, there has been a significant scope of interest for microfluidics-based three-electrode potentiostat sensing platforms, which have been extensively used for sustainable food safety exploration because of their progressively high selectivity and sensitivity. Meticulously, scholars have made noteworthy revolutions in signal enrichment tactics, measurable devices, and portable tools, which can be used as an allusion to food safety investigation. Additionally, a device for this purpose must incorporate simplistic working conditions, automation, and miniaturization. In order to meet the critical needs of food safety for on-site detection of pathogens, point-of-care testing (POCT) has to be introduced and integrated with microfluidic technology and electrochemical biosensors. This review critically discusses the recent literature, classification, difficulties, applications, and future directions of microfluidics-based electrochemical sensors for screening and detecting foodborne pathogens.},

  abstract = {In recent times, microheaters have gained a vast range of attention due to their universal existence in most research domains such as healthcare, pharmaceutical, clinical, electrical, and mechanical applications. Especially, post-COVID-19 the significance of microheaters in the point-of-care-testing based microdevices has immensely increased and overlaid the way for the possibility of the development of microfluidic-based diagnostics tools for point-of-care applications. In microfluidics, temperature is a crucial aspect but occasionally disregarded parameter due to its non-uniform distribution and unstable heat regulation within the microchannels. Nevertheless, fluctuations in size, ramping rate, stability, and accuracy make them unsuitable for operating in isolated areas. Microarchitecture of heaters decreases power utilization, increases ramping rate, maintains uniform temperature distribution, executes rapid response, and improves temperature conductivity. The usual thickness of a microheater comes around 100 nm to 100 {$\mu$}m and provides precision control over a temperature range of up to {$>$}1000 {\textopenbullet}C. Because of the escalating demand for wearable biosensors, wearable electronics, and flexible materials, microheaters have transpired as an exigent and peremptory in most research areas. This review comprehensively discusses several different kinds of microheaters emphasizing design, material selection, optimization, and fabrication tools, that are predominantly used in microfluidic technology for POCT applications. Further, this also throws limelight on emerging technological trends and challenges in microelectro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) based microheaters that can pave the way for developing advanced, rapid, reliable, and susceptible devices that are implemented in healthcare diagnostics, electrical, biomedical, and mechanical domains within microscale environment.},

  abstract = {Dynamic follow up and analysis of isolated single cells that display non-adhering behavior is hindered by the fact that they float in the suspension medium and thus requires the implementation of systems that physically entrap the cells for successful analysis. We describe the potential of digital microfluidic (DMF) chip technology for conducting analysis of cells in suspension at the single cell resolution. More specifically, we demonstrate the use of DMF technology for the analysis of a group of single individual protoplasts from Arabidopsis thaliana plants that are labeled with magnetic particles and are immobilized on the DMF chip by magnetic forces. By transporting droplets with different osmotic conditions to the site where the cells are trapped, we challenge the cells and monitor their responses dynamically with a camera. The use of DMF technology for performing water potential measurements has the following advantages: (i) solid particles such as cells and magnetic beads are manipulated on the chip without the risk of clogging channels, (ii) low shear stress during droplet unit operations like mixing and transport that characterize DMF are particularly suited for analysis of delicate cells types that lack cell walls such as protoplasts, (iii) the throughput of the analysis is strongly increased as multiple protoplasts are analyzed simultaneously, in contrast with the traditional methods that can handle and challenge only one cell at a time. We show that the DMF analysis platform is effective in creating the steep osmotic gradients required for calculation of water permeability coefficients (P) as the values found are comparable with previously reported ones thus validating the suitability of the technology for such studies. This work illustrates a proof of concept for the applicability of DMF as an unparalleled and promising system for implementing single cells studies on non-adhering cells in an automated way.},

In the present work, the wettability of the surface is varied by applying alternating current electrowetting on a dielectric (AC EWOD), and the electrowetting-integrated droplet impact characteristics are analyzed for different frequencies, waveforms of applied voltages, and different sizes of droplets. A numerical technique with a dynamic contact model is developed to track the movement of the three-phase contact line in the electrowettingintegrated droplet impact process. The maximum spreading diameter of the droplet increases, and the recoiling of the droplet decreases with the increase in applied frequency at the first oscillation cycle of the droplet. Droplet spreading is more for the sinusoidal waveform than the triangular waveform. The impact of voltage frequency on the droplet spreading is more significant than the voltage waveform. The effect of electrowetting on the droplet impact is less for small-size droplets than the larger droplets. The electrowetting effect increases the dynamic wetting characteristics of the surface, resulting in enhanced spreading and reduced recoiling of the impacting droplet.},

  abstract = {A droplet impacting hydrophobic/superhydrophobic surfaces undergoes spreading, recoiling, and rebounding. All these phenomena are affected by the energy exchange between the impacting droplet and the surface. In the present work, an electrowetting technique is implemented to change the droplet interaction with the surface. The droplet impact on hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surfaces combined with alternating current electrowetting on dielectric (AC EWOD) has been numerically investigated. Droplet impact characteristics have been studied for various voltage amplitudes, frequencies, and surface hydrophobicities. These factors strongly affect the droplet dynamics of the impacting droplet. An increase in voltage amplitude enhances the maximum spreading of the impacting droplet. In contrast, it reduces the recoiling rate of the droplet, resulting in partial or complete suppression of the droplet rebound. At a particular voltage amplitude, frequency and hydrophobicity of the surface affect the droplet rebound suppression. Complete rebound suppression has been observed at higher voltage amplitudes and the medium range of frequencies (25--50 Hz). The contact time of the droplet decreases with the increase in surface hydrophobicity at all frequencies, whereas it increases with the voltage amplitude. Contact line velocity and velocity inside the droplet manifest the inertia of the droplet. The droplet is unable to rebound if velocities are very low.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic biochips are recently being developed for on-chip implementation of biochemical laboratory assays. Existing mixing algorithms determine the mixing tree or mixing graph from a given target ratio of several biochemical fluids for on-chip mixture preparation. We present an algorithm to determine a reduced mixing tree by sharing the common subtrees within itself. We observe two transformations that preserve the semantics of the tree: (a) permutation of leaf nodes (input fluids/reagents) within the same level of a mixing tree, and (b) level-shifting of a leaf node to the next lower level by duplicating its appearance. The proposed algorithm utilizes both the intermediate droplets obtained after a split operation when a pair of identical subtrees are identified under permutation of leaf nodes at the same level. Simulation results for a large set of target ratios show that our algorithm reduces the mean values of the total number of mix-split steps, waste droplets and the number of mixer modules required for earliest completion by 16\%, 29\% and 12\% over Min-Mix and by 22\%, 34\% and 20\% over RMA, respectively. Moreover, it reduces the number of checkpoint insertions required for dynamic error recovery against incorrect mix-split steps during mixture preparation.},

  abstract = {Magnetoelectric heterostructures have been one of the hottest topics for the research community in the material science field. The interaction between piezoelectric and ferromagnetic orders leads to magnetoelectric coupling. The magnetic sensors based on magnetoelectric coupling have gained attention for futuristic device applications due to their low cost, easy fabrication, high sensitivity, and room temperature working. A series of milestones have been achieved in increasing the sensing performance of magnetoelectric-based magnetic sensors. This review compiles the recent research related to magnetoelectric sensors. The output noises and self-bias effects of these magnetoelectric sensors in different designs are summarized by compiling the recent research. Firstly, the magnetoelectric sensor based on the induced voltage mechanism has been explored in bulk, thin-film, and cantilever configurations. The magnetoelectric coupling improves at the electromechanical resonant frequency of the cantilever due to the reduction in noise level. However, these cantilever-based sensors suffer from the narrow bandwidth in resonance mode and exhibit decrement in sensitivity below their resonant frequency. Recently emerged signal modulation and delta-E (∆E) effect-based magnetoelectric sensors are thoroughly reviewed to measure low frequency or DC magnetic fields. In modulated signal-based magnetoelectric sensors, the electrical, magnetic, rotation, and amplitude modulation techniques are explored. However, an external carrier field requirement generates additional magnetic noises and degrades the sensitivity. On the other hand, the magnetic fieldinduced alteration in the resonant frequency is measured in the ∆E-based magnetic sensor. The ∆E-based sensors are discussed in cantilever and acoustic resonator configurations. The hybrid magnetoelectric configurations are also explored with fluxgate and magnetoresistive technology. The real-time application of a magnetoelectric sensor can be examined to detect the spatial orientation of the earth's magnetic field, magnetic signals from the brain and heart of the human body. These magnetoelectric sensors are the futuristic candidate for next-generation practical applications in bio-medical, geomagnetic, and magnetic anomaly detections.},

Therefore, rapid, accurate, and specific detection of these microorganisms (i.e., bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and parasitic pathogens) in water resources has become a requirement of water quality assessment. Significant research has been conducted to develop rapid, efficient, scalable, and affordable sensing techniques to detect biological contaminants. State-of-the-art technology-assisted smart sensors have improved features (high sensitivity and very low detection limit) and can perform in a real-time manner. However, there is still a need to promote this area of research, keeping global aspects and demand in mind. Keeping this view, this article was designed carefully and critically to explore sensing technologies developed for the detection of biological contaminants. Advancements using paper-based assays, microfluidic platforms, and lateral flow devices are discussed in this report. The emerging recent trends, mainly point-of-care (POC) technologies, of water safety analysis are also discussed here, along with challenges and future prospective applications of these smart sensing technologies for water health diagnostics.},

  abstract = {Generating controlled vortices in a sessile surface droplet configuration in an energy efficient manner is an outstanding research problem of interdisciplinary relevance, having implications in widely varying areas ranging from biomedical diagnostics, thermal management to digital microfluidic technology. Here, we experimentally and theoretically demonstrate a simple yet energy efficient strategy for generating controlled vortices inside a surface droplet, by deploying interacting electrical and thermal fields over inter-digitated electrodes on an electrically wetted platform. Unlike the traditional electrically driven mechanisms, this strategy involves significantly low voltage ({$\leq$}10 V) to induce rotational structures inside the droplet, by exploiting the strong spatial gradient of electrical properties on account of the prevailing thermal field as attributable to intrinsically induced Joule heating effects. Our experiments demonstrate that fluid velocities typically of the order of mm/s can be generated inside the droplet within the standard regimes of operating parameters, bearing far-reaching consequences towards enhancing internal mixing in multifarious droplet based microfluidic applications. An inherent integrability with the existing electrowetting on dielectric platforms renders the process ideal to be used in conjunction with digital microfluidic technology.},

  abstract = {In recent years, (bio)electrochemical systems (B)ES have emerged as an energy efficient alternative for the recovery of TAN (total ammonia nitrogen, including ammonia and ammonium) from wastewater. In these systems, TAN is removed or concentrated from the wastewater under the influence of an electrical current and transported to the cathode. Subsequently, it can be removed or recovered through stripping, chemisorption, or forward osmosis. A crucial parameter that determines the energy required to recover TAN is the load ratio: the ratio between TAN loading and applied current. For electrochemical TAN recovery, an energy input is required, while in bioelectrochemical recovery, electric energy can be recovered together with TAN. Bioelectrochemical recovery relies on the microbial oxidation of COD for the production of electrons, which drives TAN transport. Here, the state-of-the-art of (bio)electrochemical TAN recovery is described, the performance of (B)ES for TAN recovery is analyzed, the potential of different wastewaters for BES-based TAN recovery is evaluated, the microorganisms found on bioanodes that treat wastewater high in TAN are reported, and the toxic effect of the typical conditions in such systems (e.g., high pH, TAN, and salt concentrations) are described. For future application, toxicity effects for electrochemically active bacteria need better understanding, and the technologies need to be demonstrated on larger scale.},

  abstract = {Fisheries, one of the growing sectors in Malaysia, contribute a notable percentage to the national gross domestic product. The fisheries sector rapidly and dynamically grew throughout the past three decades. Aquaculture commodities are currently providing remarkable contributions to the fisheries sector, overcoming the previous dominance of traditional marine capture commodities. The fisheries sector is facing environmental issues, especially considering water-related pollution, despite its contribution to the economic sector. Aquaculture effluents contain high organic materials, nutrients, proteins, and even contaminants of emerging concern. Several studies have already been conducted to treat the generated wastewater. However, investigations on environmentally friendly technology, which might lead to resource recovery from aquaculture effluent, are still limited and scarce. This review paper comprises the development of aquaculture in Malaysia, its potential of generating abundant amounts of wastewater, and its characteristics. This paper summarizes the best practice of aquaculture effluent treatment and also highlights the green technology, which can be utilized to overcome the issue of currently utilized physico-chemical treatment. In addition, this paper emphasizes the considerable potential of valuable material recovery from the aquaculture effluent using a combination of bio-coagulant/bio-flocculant utilization and constructed wetland to achieve cleaner production for the aquaculture sector.},

In this review, we provide the details of primary microfluidic techniques that have received much attention for bioassays. First, we introduce the manipulation techniques using a sole driving source, i.e., dielectrophoresis, electrophoresis, optical tweezers, magnetophoresis, and acoustophoresis. Next, we present rapid electrokinetic patterning, a hybrid opto-electric manipulation technique developed recently. It is introduced in detail along with the underlying physical principle, operating environment, and current challenges. This paper will offer readers the opportunity to improve existing manipulation techniques, suggest new manipulation techniques, and find new applications in biotechnology.},

  abstract = {Heavy metal pollution of water has become a global issue and is especially problematic in some developing countries. Heavy metals are toxic to living organisms, even at very low concentrations. Therefore, effective and reliable heavy metal detection in environmental water is very important. Current laboratory-based methods used for analysis of heavy metals in water require sophisticated instrumentation and highly trained technicians, making them unsuitable for routine heavy metal monitoring in the environment. Consequently, there is a growing demand for autonomous detection systems that could perform in situ or point-of-use measurements. Microfluidic detection systems, which are defined by their small size, have many characteristics that make them suitable for environmental analysis. Some of these advantages include portability, high sample throughput, reduced reagent consumption and waste generation, and reduced production cost. This review focusses on developments in the application of microfluidic detection systems to heavy metal detection in water. Microfluidic detection strategies based on optical techniques, electrochemical techniques, and quartz crystal microbalance are discussed.},

This format provides the opportunity to tune the amount (and potentially the type) of stationary phase on-the-fly, and allows the removal of beads after the extraction (to enable other operations in same device-space), maintaining device reconfigurability. Using the new method, we employed a design of experiments (DOE) operation to enable automated on-chip optimization of elution solvent composition for reversed phase SPE of a model system. Further, conditions were selected to enable on-chip fractionation of multiple analytes. Finally, the method was demonstrated to be useful for online cleanup of extracts from dried blood spot (DBS) samples. We anticipate this combination of features will prove useful for separating a wide range of analytes, from small molecules to peptides, from complex matrices.},

Confinement of single cells to small, picoliter-sized droplets within a continuous phase of oil provides chemical isolation of each cell, creating individual microreactors where rare cell qualities are highlighted and otherwise undetectable signals can be concentrated to measurable levels. Recent work in microfluidics has yielded methods for the encapsulation of cells in aqueous droplets and hydrogels at kilohertz rates, creating the potential for millions of parallel single-cell experiments. However, commercial applications of high-throughput microdroplet generation and downstream sensing and actuation methods are still emerging for cells.

  abstract = {An intelligent digital microfluidic processor for biomedical detection is presented. This potential architecture solves lots of traditional development bottlenecks to implement the easy-to-control, easy-to-monitor, system automation and high accuracy for bioassay detection purposes. The proposed processor integrates the functions of microfluidic actuation, droplet location readback and high sensitivity measurement window to demonstrate a novel prototype for personalized medicine. Furthermore, the droplet location map and reaction behaviors are visible on a 2-dimentional (2D) graphical user-interface due to the micro electrode dot array (MEDA) architecture and capacitive sensing technology, and hence system automation is achievable. Fabricated in standard 0.35 {$\mu$}m CMOS process, this work integrates 900 microelectrodes with measurement window in 3.2 mm2, where the high sensitivity capacitive readout circuit occupies only 0.048 mm2. Measurement results show that microdroplet actuation and 2D location map are activated under 1KHz. In addition, the function of digital signal extraction, processing, as well as statistical analysis can be operated under 1 MHz respectively.},

  abstract = {Managing waterborne ammonia--nitrogen pollution requires monitoring distributed wastewater nitrogen discharges. In this study, we demonstrated and investigated a proof-ofconcept sensor that combines selective electrochemical separation and sensitive capacitive detection for sensing total ammonia nitrogen (TAN). By varying TAN concentration in synthetic ammonia-polluted water (up to 50 mg/L), we selectively separated ammonia nitrogen from feedwater into a sulfuric acid solution, in which capacitance decreased linearly with increasing TAN (R2 {$>$} 0.99). Experimental observations were supported by theoretical explanations for the decrease in capacitance as ammonia absorbs into the sulfuric acid solution and abstracts protons. Capacitive detection facilitated TAN sensing at higher acid concentrations (up to 0.5 M H2SO4) than conductivity detection (up to 0.01 M H2SO4), which enables sensitive sensors with larger TAN detection ranges, longer deployment, and less complexity. Results from this study provide evidence of the use of selective separations and their transport mechanisms for environmental sensing applications.},

The latter are termed ``surface transverse waves'' (STW), and they have comparatively low attenuation values when operated in liquids. Later Love wave devices were developed, which used a film resonance effect to significantly reduce attenuation. All of these sensor approaches were accompanied by the development of appropriate sensing films. First attempts used simple layers of adsorbed antibodies. Later approaches used various types of covalently bound layers, for example those utilizing intermediate hydrogel layers. Recent approaches involve SAW biosensor devices inserted into compact systems with integrated fluidics for sample handling. To achieve this, the SAW biosensors can be embedded into micromachined polymer housings. Combining these two features will extend the system to create versatile biosensor arrays for generic lab use or for diagnostic purposes.},

  abstract = {Single-cell analysis techniques have been developed as a valuable bioanalytical tool for elucidating cellular heterogeneity at genomic, proteomic, and cellular levels. Cell manipulation is an indispensable process for single-cell analysis. Digital microfluidics (DMF) is an important platform for conducting cell manipulation and single-cell analysis in a high-throughput fashion. However, the manipulation of single cells in DMF has not been quantitatively studied so far. In this article, we investigate the interaction of a single microparticle with a liquid droplet on a flat substrate using numerical simulations. The droplet is driven by capillary force generated from the wettability gradient of the substrate. Considering the Brownian motion of microparticles, we utilize many-body dissipative particle dynamics (MDPD), an off-lattice mesoscopic simulation technique, in this numerical study. The manipulation processes (including pickup, transport, and drop-off) of a single microparticle with a liquid droplet are simulated. Parametric studies are conducted to investigate the effects on the manipulation processes from the droplet size, wettability gradient, wetting properties of the microparticle, and particle-substrate friction coefficients. The numerical results show that the pickup, transport, and drop-off processes can be precisely controlled by these parameters. On the basis of the numerical results, a trap-free delivery of a hydrophobic microparticle to a destination on the substrate is demonstrated in the numerical simulations. The numerical results not only provide a fundamental understanding of interactions among the microparticle, the droplet, and the substrate but also demonstrate a new technique for the trap-free immobilization of single hydrophobic microparticles in the DMF design. Finally, our numerical method also provides a powerful design and optimization tool for the manipulation of microparticles in DMF systems.},

This review article aims to summarize some of the most important findings on iDEP organized by the type of dielectrophoretic mode: streaming and trapping iDEP. The former is primarily used for particle sorting, while the latter has great capability for particle enrichment. The characteristics of a wide array of devices are discussed for each type of dielectrophoretic mode in order to present an overview of the distinct designs and applications developed with iDEP. A short section on Joule heating effects and electrothermal flow is also included to highlight some of the challenges in the utilization of iDEP systems. The significant progress on iDEP illustrates its potential for a large number of applications, ranging from bioanalysis to clinical and biomedical assessments. The present article discusses the work on iDEP by numerous research groups around the world, with the aim of proving the reader with an overview of the state-of-the-art in iDEP microfluidic systems.},

However, the complex and nonlinear behavior of multiphase microfluidic devices and several parameters affecting droplet size simultaneously necessitates costly design iterations to generate droplets with the radius of interest for a certain application. To address this, we exploit soft computing methods to bridge fuzzy systems and neural networks in order to build an adaptive neural-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) that predicts the droplet size generated in a flow-focusing microfluidic device based on six major parameters, that includes geometry, flow, and fluid properties. This model shows a significant accuracy with a coefficient of determination of 0.96 when compared to the observed data points. Once the ANFIS model is built and verified, we use it to study the effect of each input parameter on droplet size which is challenging and/or expensive to determine experimentally.},

This tool delivers a user-specified performance within 4.2\% and 11.5\% of the desired diameter and rate.

In this contribution, a microfluidic platform, combining the actuation principle of electrowetting on dielectrics for droplet manipulations and the sensor principle of impedance spectroscopy for the characterization of the fluid composition and condition, is presented. The fabrication process of the microfluidic platform comprises physical vapor deposition and structuring of the metal electrodes onto a substrate, the deposition of a dielectric isolator and a hydrophobic top coating. The key advantage of this microfluidic chip is the common electric nature of the sensor and the actuation principle. This allows for fabricating digital microfluidic devices with a minimal number of process steps. Multiple measurements on fluids of different composition (including rigid particles) and of different conditions (temperature, sedimentation) were performed and process parameters were monitored online.

Additionally, the macroscopic contact angle was optically measured in order to verify the bio-specific binding and to test the implications onto the balance of the surface tensions. Using these sample applications, we were able to demonstrate and to verify the feasibility of integrating a mass-sensitive QCM sensor into a digital microfluidic chip.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a study on a method for efficiently manipulating droplets on a two-dimensional (2-D) plane using only a limited number of electrodes by employing the asymmetric oscillation characteristic of droplets actuated by electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) at low frequencies. In this study, the droplets actuated by lowfrequency EWOD were found to oscillate repeating asymmetric expansion and recession, while at the same time wetting on the surface of electrodes. Using the EWOD electrodes in the coplanar design fabricated through the MEMS process, the dynamic behaviors of asymmetrically oscillating droplets with different viscosities and their horizontal transportations caused by the oscillation were investigated by high-speed images. Then, an analysis was made of the changes in droplet radius, position, and contact angle as a function of frequency that applied during the EWOD actuation, in order to confirm that the droplets transported horizontally in the vicinity of the resonance frequency at which the droplets were more increasingly inclined to exhibit asymmetric oscillation. Furthermore, another study was performed to demonstrate droplet transference in conjunction with droplet transportation. In this study, the droplets transporting horizontally under the influence of low-frequency EWOD actuation were transferred to the adjacent electrodes spaced at regular gaps. The results were used to determine the spacing of the electrodes that allowed the transference of the droplets and the threshold voltage required for the transference. Lastly, as proof of concept, the manipulation of two 4 {$\mu$}L droplets was successfully demonstrated on a 7.5 {\texttimes} 3 cm2 transparent chip using only seven patterned electrodes.},

  abstract = {Here, we report a simple and effective method for capturing and displacement of gram-negative bacteria using aptamer-modified microbeads and acoustophoresis. As acoustophoresis allows for simultaneous washing and size-dependent separation in continuous flow mode, we efficiently obtained gram-negative bacteria that showed high affinity without any additional washing steps. The proposed device has a simple and efficient channel design, utilizing a long, square-shaped microchannel that shows excellent separation performance in terms of the purity, recovery, and concentration factor. Microbeads (10 {\textmu}m) coated with the GN6 aptamer can specifically bind gram-negative bacteria. After incubation of bacteria culture sample with aptamer affinity bead, gram-negative bacteria-bound microbeads, and other unbound/contaminants can be separated by size with high purity and recovery. The device demonstrated excellent separation performance, with high recovery (up to 98\%), high purity (up to 99\%), and a high-volume rate (500 {\textmu}L/min). The acoustophoretic separation performances were conducted using 5 Gram-negative bacteria and 5 Gram-positive bacteria. Thanks to GN6 aptamer's binding affinity, aptamer affinity bead also showed binding affinity to multiple strains of gram-negative bacteria, but not to gram-positive bacteria. GN6 coated bead can capture Gram-negative bacteria but not Gram-positive bacteria. This study may present a different perspective in the field of early diagnosis in bacterial infectious diseases. In addition to detecting living bacteria or bacteria-derived biomarkers, this protocol can be extended to monitoring the contamination of water resources and may aid quick responses to bioterrorism and pathogenic bacterial infections.},

  abstract = {A sudden increase of algae and their associated toxins in aquatic ecosystems can detrimentally affect the quality of the water, causing serious socio-economic and public health problems. To prevent the spread of harmful algae in aquatic ecosystems, it is essential to track the water's quality through rapid and in-situ monitoring systems. Conventional methods of algae quantification such as microscopy, hemocytometry, and UV--vis spectroscopy, however, are often unsuitable or inconvenient for in-situ assessment as they require skilled labor and expensive equipment. In this study, we developed a three-dimensional (3D)-printed smartphone platform integrated with a light-driven microfluidic chip operated by optoelectrowetting (OEW). This OEW-driven microfluidic chip not only allows multiplexed drop-wise functions such as droplet transportation, merging, mixing, immobilization on a detection zone, for on-chip water sample preparation but also fluorescent detection and counting of target algae cells using a commercially-available smartphone. Two freshwater algae (C. reinhardtii and M. aeruginosa) and two marine water algae (Amphiprora sp and C. closterium) were employed to validate the 3D-printed smartphone platform in this study. The fluorescence images of viable algae and the cell counting from the microfluidic chip were comparable to the results from a hemocytometer (P {$>$} 0.05). We have further conducted tests with spiked samples using freshwater and marine water that were directly collected from environmental samples, showing the same order of magnitude of cell numbers in the spiked and control cultures of algae cells (106 cell/mL, P {$>$} 0.05). Unlike traditional quantification methods, the 3D-printed smartphone platform integrated with the OEW offers a highly portable, user-friendly, low-cost tool that enables simple on-chip sample preparation and detection of viable algae. Thus, this stand-alone technology has the potential for rapid and insitu monitoring of water quality, while using the smartphone's wireless communication capabilities to report the quality of the water in real-time.},

  abstract = {In ac electrowetting, hydrodynamic flows occur within a droplet. Two distinct flow patterns were observed, depending on the frequency of the applied electrical signal. The flow at low-frequency range was explained in terms of shape oscillation and a steady streaming process in conjunction with contact line oscillation. The origin of the flow at high-frequency range has not yet been explained. We suggest that the high-frequency flow originated mainly from the electrothermal effect, in which electrical charge is generated due to the gradient of electrical conductivity and permittivity, which is induced by the Joule heating of fluid medium. To support our argument, we analyzed the flow field numerically while considering the electrical body force generated by the electrothermal effect. We visualized the flow pattern and measured the flow velocity inside the droplet. The numerical results show qualitative agreement with experimental results with respect to electric field and frequency dependence of flow velocity. The effects of induced-charge electro-osmosis, natural convection, and the Marangoni flow are discussed.},

EW and EWOD are principles that can control wettability of liquids on solid surfaces using electric potential. While EW is controlling wettability of a certain electrolyte on a metal electrode by varying electric energy across the electrical double layer \$EDL), EWOD applies to virtually any aqueous liquid by varying electric energy across the thin dielectric {\textregistered}lm between the liquid and conducting substrate. These driving mechanisms have many advantages. By electrically changing the wettability of each of the electrode patterns on a surface, a liquid on these electrodes can be shaped and driven along the active electrodes, making micro{\textasciimacron}uidics extremely simple both for device fabrication and operation. It is also worth noting that, driven by surface tension, the mechanism becomes more effective as the size of the device becomes smaller. This paper describes fundamental concepts and the proof-of-concept experiments, modeling and design, microfabrication processes, and initial testing results for the micro{\textasciimacron}uidic devices based on the EW and EWOD principles. \# 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this study, electrowetting actuations with square pulse signals are employed to detach droplets from a hydrophobic surface. The threshold voltage for droplet detachment is obtained both experimentally and theoretically to find that it is almost constant for various droplet volumes ranging from 0.4 to 10 {$\mu$}L. It is also found that droplets can be detached more easily when the width of applied pulse is well-matched to the spreading time (i.e., the time to reach the maximum spread diameter). When the droplet is actuated by a double square pulse, the threshold voltage is reduced by {$\sim$}20\% from that for a single square pulse actuation. Finally, by introducing an interdigitated electrode system, it is demonstrated that droplets can be detached from the solid bottom surface without using a top needle electrode.},

These are categorized into several groups based on the principle applied: conventional culture methods, immunology-based assays, nucleic acid-based assays, miniaturized biochemical assays, and biosensors. Conventional culture methods serve as the basis in food testing laboratories despite rather laborious and time-consuming protocols. Considerable progress in rapid methods using emerging technologies yield faster answers and higher throughput of samples. This paper also shows and analyzes Salmonella test results and summarizes the features and limitations of the studies involving Salmonella detection methods developed for emergency response, mainly by food emergency response laboratories participating during recent fiscal years. The emergency response laboratories utilize Salmonella detection methods possessing properties that include simplicity, versatility, high sensitivity, good specificity, and cost efficiency.

  abstract = {Digital microfluidics has become intensively explored as an effective method for liquid handling in lab-on-a-chip (LOC) systems. Liquid dielectrophoresis (L-DEP) has many advantages and exciting prospects in driving droplets. To fully realize the potential benefits of this technique, one must know the droplet volume accurately for its distribution and manipulation. Here we present an investigation of the tensile length of a droplet subjected to a L-DEP force with varied parameters to achieve precise control of the volume of a droplet. Liquid propylene carbonate served as a driving liquid in the L-DEP experiment. The chip was divided into two parts: an electrode of width fixed at 0.1 mm and a total width fixed at 1 mm. Each had a variation of six electrode spacings. The experimental results showed that the stretching length decreased with decreasing electrode width, but the stretching length did not vary with an increased spacing of the electrode. When the two electrodes were activated, the length decreased because of an increase in electrode spacing. The theory was based on the force balance on a droplet that involved the force generated by the electric field, friction force, and capillary force. The theory was improved according to the experimental results. To verify the theoretical improvement through the results, we designed a three-electrode chip for experiments. The results proved that the theory is consistent with the results of the experiments, so that the length of a droplet stretched with L-DEP and its volume can be calculated.},

Key to the fluid processing in droplet format are the controlled droplet handling and movement on the microscale. Hence this paper proposes droplet handling by combining droplet microfluidics with bulk acoustic wave (BAW) acoustophoresis. BAW acoustophoresis has formerly focused on cell and particle handling, whereas here we determine the various abilities of this method for the field of droplet microfluidics. In silicon microdevices, water-in-oil droplets of 200 {$\mu$}m size were generated for a set of unit operations including droplet fusion, focusing, sorting and medium exchange around 0.5--1 MHz acoustic frequency. Compared to existing droplet handling methods, the shown method is simple in fabrication, robust in operation and versatile to meet the needs of various droplet processing microfluidic devices.},

The co-integration of               microfluidic               and               microelectronic               technologies enables an association between the droplet managements and {$\mu$}NMR assays inside a portable sub-Tesla magnet (1.2 kg, 0.46 Tesla). Targets in unprocessed biological samples, captured by specific probe-decorated magnetic nanoparticles (NPs), can be sequentially quantified by their spin--spin relaxation time (               T               2               )               via               multiplexed {$\mu$}NMR screening. Distinct droplet samples are operated by a digital microfluidic device that electronically manages the electrowetting-on-dielectric effects over an electrode array. Each electrode (3.5 {\texttimes} 3.5 mm               2               ) is scanned with capacitive sensing to locate the distinct droplet samples in real time. A cross-domain-optimized butterfly-coil-input semiconductor transceiver transduces between magnetic and electrical signals to/from a sub-10 {$\mu$}L droplet sample for high-sensitivity {$\mu$}NMR screening. A temperature logger senses the ambient temperature (0 to 40 {$^\circ$}C) and a backend processor calibrates the working frequency for the transmitter to precisely excite the protons. In our experiments, the {$\mu$}NMR relaxometer quantifies avidin using biotinylated Iron NPs (               {$\Phi$}               : 30 nm, [Fe]: 0.5 mM) with a sensitivity of 0.2 {$\mu$}M. Auto-handling and identification of two targets (avidin and water) are demonstrated and completed within 2.2 min. This {$\mu$}NMR relaxometer holds promise for combinatorial chemical/biological diagnostic protocols using closed-loop electronic automation.},

Digital microfluidics (DMF) is an emerging technique for miniaturized and automated droplet manipulation, which has been proposed as a promising tool for proteomic sample preparation. However, proteome analysis of samples prepared on-chip by DMF has previously been unfeasible, due to incompatibility with down-stream LC-MS instrumentation. To overcome these limitations, we here developed protocols for bottom-up LC-MS based proteomics sample preparation of as little as 100 mammalian cells on a commercially available digital microfluidics device. To this end, we developed effective cell lysis conditions optimized for DMF, as well as detergent--buffer systems compatible with downstream proteolytic digestion on DMF chips and subsequent LC-MS analysis. A major step was the introduction of the single-pot, solid-phase-enhanced sample preparation (SP3) approach on-chip, which allowed the removal of salts and anti-fouling polymeric detergents, thus rendering sample preparation by DMF compatible with LC-MS-based proteome analysis. Application of DMF-SP3 to the proteome analysis of Jurkat T cells led to the identification of up to 2500 proteins from approximately 500 cells, and up to 1200 proteins from approximately 100 cells on an Orbitrap mass spectrometer, emphasizing the high compatibility of DMF-SP3 with low protein input and minute volumes handled by DMF. Taken together, we demonstrate the first sample preparation workflow for proteomics on a DMF chip device reported so far, allowing the sensitive analysis of limited biological material.},

All the disciplines of gDEP are originated from the interaction of an applied electric field with its polarisation effect on the particle and can be studied systematically in a unified approach under electrostatics. In this review, the authors discuss both the quasi-static and transient theory of gDEP in an unbounded medium for both spherical and ellipsoidal particles. Then the quasi-static theory of wall effect is discussed on gDEP for a spherical particle. The wall effect is minor for ER, twDEP and cDEP parallel to wall(s), but could be significant for cDEP normal to wall(s). Force and torque expressions in terms of electric potential and its derivatives are provided and suggested for a robust calculation of the twDEP force and DEP torque. Discussions are provided for the application of the theory to nano-sized particles. The authors also illustrate some features of the Clausius --Mossotti factor using erythrocyte as an example, including both the crossover (DEP) and peak frequencies (ER) at low and high-frequency limits.},

This shrinkage has demanded that the primary integration platform, the printed circuit board (PCB), follow this same trend. Today, PCB companies offer {\textasciitilde}100 micron sized features (depth and width) which mean they are becoming suitable as physical platforms for Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC) and microfluidic applications. Compared to current lithographic based fluidic approaches; PCB technology offers several advantages that are useful for this technology. These include: Being easily designed and changed using free software, robust structures that can often be reused, chip layouts that can be ordered from commercial PCB suppliers at very low cost (1 AUD each in this work), and integration of electrodes at no additional cost. Here we present the application of PCB technology in connection with microfluidics for several biomedical applications. In case of commercialization the costs for each device can be even further decreased to approximately one tenth of its current cost.},

JLMs are multifunctional next-generation LMs comprising two hemispherical domains of distinct physicochemical properties such as size, hydrophobicity, electrical conductivity, surface functionalization, stimuli-responsivity, and so on. The JLMs offer precise control on the manipulability and enhanced performance over pristine LMs. Though the properties, applications, and progress of LMs are detailed in the recent literature, a focused review encompassing the fabrication, recent developments, potential applications of JLMs, and the challenges regarding its reliable fabrication remains a gap in the literature.

  abstract = {In this study, the numerical computation is used to investigate the transient movement of a water droplet in a microchannel. For tracking the evolution of the free interface between two immiscible fluids, we employed the finite element method with the two-phase level set technique to solve the Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the energy equation. Both the upper wall and the bottom wall of the microchannel are set to be an ambient temperature. 40mW heat source is placed at the distance of 1 mm from the initial position of a water droplet. When the heat source is turned on, a pair of asymmetric thermocapillary convection vortices is formed inside the droplet and the thermocapillary on the receding side is smaller than that on the advancing side. The temperature gradient inside the droplet increases quickly at the initial times and then decreases versus time. Therefore, the actuation velocity of the water droplet first increases significantly, and then decreases continuously. The dynamic contact angle is strongly affected by the oil flow motion and the net thermocapillary momentum inside the droplet. The advancing contact angle is always larger than the receding contact angle during actuation process.},

Establishing a microfluidic chip with point-of-care capabilities, including actuation and annealing, has proven to be important. Unfortunately, poor heat absorption due to the long optical penetration depth of near infrared light creates scaling limitations for applications in optical-based microfluidics. Through the application of WGM, the interaction length between the droplet and light is increased beyond the droplet diameter to improve heating and optical absorption. This is supported by finite-difference time-domain electromagnetic simulations and experimental results showing a greatly improved temperature change. Such a system is implemented in an open system digital microfluidic chip, to facilitate annealing via side illumination of droplets. The open system digital microfluidic chip is programmable for droplet actuation. The fundamental experiment of preprogrammed actuation of microdroplets is demonstrated in a 36 electrode grid. The results of annealing and actuation show potential for implementation in point-of-care microfluidic devices.},

A DMFB, composed of a twodimensional electrode array, manipulates discrete fluid droplets to automatically execute biochemical protocols such as point-of-care clinical diagnosis. However, a major concern associated with the use of DMFBs is that electrodes in a biochip can degrade over time. Droplet-transportation operations associated with the degraded electrodes can fail, thereby compromising the integrity of the bioassay outcome. We show that casting droplet transportation as an RL problem enables the training of deep network policies to capture the underlying health conditions of electrodes and provide reliable fluidic operations. We propose a new RLbased droplet-routing flow that can be used for various sizes of DMFBs, and demonstrate reliable execution of an epigenetic bioassay with the RL droplet router on a fabricated DMFB. To facilitate further research, we also present a simulation environment based on the OpenAI Gym Interface for RL-guided droplet-routing problems on DMFBs.},

With driving voltages less than 15 V it is believed to be the lowest reported driving voltage for any material system compatible with post-processing on completed integrated circuits wafers. The process architecture uses anodically grown tantalum pentoxide as a pinhole free high dielectric constant insulator with an overlying 16 nm layer of Teflon-AF{\`O}, which provides the hydrophobic surface for droplets manipulation. This stack provides a very robust dielectric, which maintains a sufficiently high capacitance per unit area for effective operation at a reduced voltage (15 V) which is more compatible with standard CMOS technology. The paper demonstrates that the sputtered tantalum layer used for the electrodes and the formation of the insulating dielectric can readily be integrated with both aluminium and copper interconnect used in foundry CMOS. {\'O} 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the latest research progress of surfaceenhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) microfluidic chips in the field of biosensing. Due to its single-molecule sensitivity, selectivity, minimal or no preprocessing, and immediacy, SERS is considered a promising biosensing technology. However, the nondirectional interactions between biological samples and the substrate, as well as fluctuations in the sample environment temperature during signal acquisition, can affect the stability and reproducibility of SERS signals. Integrating SERS spectroscopy with microfluidic chips not only leverages the continuous sample flow, high reaction efficiency, high throughput, and multifunctionality of microfluidic chips to address challenges in biosensing applications but also expands the scope of microfluidic technology by providing a novel on-chip optical detection method. The combination of SERS and microfluidic chips not only enables the complementary advantages of both technologies but also offers a highly promising ``combined technology'' for the field of biosensing. This paper starts by introducing the enhancement mechanisms of SERS and presents both labeled and label-free SERS strategies. Based on the differences in substrate properties, we broadly categorize SERS microfluidic chips into colloidal nanoparticle-based SERS microfluidic chips and fixed substrate-based SERS microfluidic chips. Finally, we review the latest research progress on SERS microfluidic chips for biosensing biological targets such as nucleic acids, proteins, small biomolecules, and live cells. In the conclusion and outlook section, we summarize the challenges faced by SERS microfluidic chips in biosensing and propose feasible solutions. To better leverage the role of SERS microfluidic chips in biosensing, we also present an outlook on the future development of this combined technology.},

Consequently, as a step forward in the bottom-up creation of artificial cells, building analogous intracellular architectures is essential for the expansion of cell-mimicking functionality. Herein, we report the development of a droplet laboratory platform to engineer complex emulsion-based, multicompartment artificial cells, using microfluidics and acoustic levitation. Such levitated models provide free-standing, dynamic, definable droplet networks for the compartmentalisation of chemical species. Equally, they can be remotely operated with pneumatic, heating, and magnetic elements for post-processing, including the incorporation of membrane proteins; alpha-hemolysin; and mechanosensitive channel of large-conductance. The assembly of droplet networks is three-dimensionally patterned with fluidic input configurations determining droplet contents and connectivity, whilst acoustic manipulation can be harnessed to reconfigure the droplet network in situ. The mechanosensitive channel can be repeatedly activated and deactivated in the levitated artificial cell by the application of acoustic and magnetic fields to modulate membrane tension on demand. This offers possibilities beyond one-time chemically mediated activation to provide repeated, non-contact, control of membrane protein function. Collectively, this expands our growing capability to program and operate increasingly sophisticated artificial cells as life-like materials.},

As an eloquent microscale liquid handling technology that gave birth to digital microfluidics, EWOD has served as the basis for many commercial products over two major application areas: optical, such as liquid lenses and reflective displays, and biomedical, such as DNA library preparation and molecular diagnostics. A number of research or start-up companies (               e.g.               , Phillips Research, Varioptic, Liquavista, and Advanced Liquid Logic) led the early commercialization efforts and eventually attracted major companies from various industry sectors (               e.g.               , Corning, Amazon, and Illumina). Although not all of the pioneering products became an instant success, the persistent growth of liquid lenses and the recent FDA approvals of biomedical analyzers proved that EWOD is a powerful tool that deserves a wider recognition and more aggressive exploration. This review presents the history around major EWOD products that hit the market to show their winding paths to commercialization and summarizes the current state of product development to peek into the future. In providing the readers with a big picture of commercializing EWOD and digital microfluidics technology, our goal is to inspire further research exploration and new entrepreneurial adventures.},

Here, a method is proposed for decreasing the saturated contact angle by controlling the behavior of charge trapping at the liquid--solid interface. An unexpected phenomenon is uncovered: for a short time the contact angle reaches smaller values before it retreats to its saturation value, which is caused by charge trapping at the liquid--solid interface. Experimental results suggest that the trapped charges can be repeatedly detrapped and retrapped when the polarity of the applied voltage is periodically reversed, which results in contact angles retreating periodically. By applying a well-modulated voltage signal with reversing polarity, the retreat movement of the contact angle can be controlled to obtain a value significantly smaller than the previously possible threshold. As a specific application of this method, an economic two-step process which is developed potentially suitable for mass-producing large-area flexible microlens arrays with controllable curvatures and wide fields of view.},

  abstract = {Droplet-based single-cell sequencing has emerged as a very powerful tool to study the cellular heterogeneity in diseased tissues for a variety of biological problems. However, the current droplet generation with a single particle and cell encapsulation is a random process and suffers from a low yield that is unable to fulfill the highthroughput analysis requirement. In this work, we present a new fluorescence-activated droplet sorting (FADS) system that can isolate single-cell droplets at high accuracy and high yield using a highly focused surface acoustic wave (HFSAW) with a beam width around 50 {$\mu$}m. The acoustic wave is locally coupled into the microfluidic channel for droplet sorting through a micropillar waveguide structure between the channel and the interdigitated transducer (IDT). This detachable acoustic sorting system allows the disposal of the microfluidic channel after a single use to avoid cross-contamination and keeps the expensive IDT device reusable. We have achieved rapid and accurate isolation of single-cell droplets with purity higher than 90\% at {$\sim$}1 kHz sorting rate with three different encapsulation contents. In addition, with the uniformly produced droplet size at {$\sim$}40 {$\mu$}m, the present acoustic FADS system enables effective sorting of small particles down to submicrometer size, which is challenging for existing fluorescence-activated cell sorting systems.},

So, there exists a huge challenge for current flexible sensors to accurately differentiate and identify what kind of external mechanical stimulus is exerted via analyzing digital signals. Here, we report a flexible dual-interdigital-electrode sensor (FDES) that consists of two interdigital electrodes and a highly pressuresensitive porous conductive sponge. The FDES can precisely identify multiple mechanical stimuli, e.g., pressing, positive bending, negative bending, X-direction stretching, and Y-direction stretching, and convert them into corresponding current variation signals. Moreover, the FDES exhibits other exceptional properties, such as high sensitivity, stretchability, large measurement range, and outstanding stability, accompanied by simple structural design and low-cost processing simultaneously. Additionally, our FDES successfully identifies various complex activities of the human body, which lays a foundation for the further development of multimode flexible sensors.},

  abstract = {A digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) is an attractive technology platform for automating laboratory procedures in biochemistry. In recent years, DMFBs based on a microelectrode-dot-array (MEDA) architecture have been proposed. MEDA biochips can provide advantages of better capability of droplet manipulation and real-time sensing ability. However, errors are likely to occur due to defects, chip degradation, and the lack of precision inherent in biochemical experiments. Therefore, an efficient error-recovery strategy is essential to ensure the correctness of assays executed on MEDA biochips. By exploiting MEDA-specific advances in droplet sensing, we present a novel error-recovery technique to dynamically reconfigure the biochip using real-time data provided by on-chip sensors. Local recovery strategies based on probabilistic-timed-automata are presented for various types of errors. An on-line synthesis technique and a control flow are also proposed to connect localrecovery procedures with global error recovery for the complete bioassay. Moreover, an integer linear programming (ILP)-based method is also proposed to select the optimal local-recovery time for each operation. Laboratory experiments using a fabricated MEDA chip are used to characterize the outcomes of key droplet operations. The PRISM model checker and three benchmarks are used for an extensive set of simulations. Our results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed error-recovery strategy.},

Specifically, for surface haptic devices, the dependence of the friction force and the electroadhesion effect on the environmental relative humidity and the finger hydration level can directly impact their design and performance. This paper presents the influence of relative humidity on the finger-surface friction force and the electroadhesion performance. Mechanisms including changes to Young's modulus of skin, contact angle change and capillary force were analyzed separately with experimental and numerical methods. Through comparison of the calculated capillary force in this paper and the electroadhesion force calculated in published papers, it was found that electrowetting at high voltage could contribute up to 60\% of the total friction force increase in electroadhesion. Therefore, in future design of surface haptic devices, the effect of electrowetting should be considered carefully.},

Droplet-interfaced electrophoresis is an emerging technique in which micro/nanometric droplets are used as a bridge and carrier of target analytes between sample treatment and electrokinetic separation steps, thus being expected to overcome the challenges of working dimension mismatch and low degree of module integration. This review covers all works on this topic from 2006 (the year of the first communication) up to 2020, with focus being given to three principal interfacing strategies, including droplets in immiscible phases, digital microfluidics with electrowetting-on-dielectric principle and inkjet droplet generation. Different instrumental developments for such purpose, the viewpoints on pros and cons of these designs as well as application demonstrations of droplet-interfaced electrokinetic strategies are discussed.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting is an elegant method to realize the motion, dispensing, splitting, and mixing of single droplets in a microfluidic system without the need for any mechanical---and fault-prone---components. By only applying an electric voltage, the interfacial energy of the fluid--solid interface is altered and the contact line of the droplet is changed. However, since the droplet shape is usually heavily distorted, it is difficult to estimate the droplet shape during the process. Further, it is often necessary to know if a process, e.g., droplet splitting on a given geometry, is possible at all, and what can be done to increase the system's reliability. It is thus important to use computer simulations to gain an understanding about the behavior of a droplet for a given electrode geometry and voltage curve. Special care must be exercised when considering surface-tension effects. We present computer simulations done with the Surface Evolver program and a template library combined with a graphical user interface (GUI) that facilitates standard tasks in the simulation of electrowetting arrays.},

A low-temperature PDMS-compatible fabrication process has been developed to reduce the stress on the lens structure. The lens has been demonstrated to be able to conform to curved surfaces smoothly. The focal length of the microlens is 29--38 mm on a flat surface, and 31--41 mm on a curved surface, varying with the voltage applied. The resolving power of the microlens is 25.39 line pairs per mm by a 1951 United States Air Force (USAF) resolution chart and the lens aberrations are measured by a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor. The focal length behavior on a curved surface is discussed and for the current lens demonstrated the focal length is slightly longer on the curved surface as a result of the effect of the curved PDMS substrate.},

However, flourishing functions require more controlled electrodes, i.e., a large-scale EWOD. Limited to cost, complexity and flexibility, existing control techniques lack strength in meeting the need of controlling increasing number of electrodes. Here, inspired by the active matrix electrowetting-on-dielectric (AM-EWOD), we present a ``direct-address based on cross-control'' (DACC) method, which can easily realize N + M pins controlling N {\texttimes} M electrodes and guarantee the control flexibility meanwhile. Moreover, combining with impedance detection technique, we set up a cheap and portable cyberphysical system. The system's software, written in JAVA, has a user-friendly interface and can sense all sites of the DMF in real-time and auto-design routes for droplets to bypass barriers. This novel integrated digital microfluidic system shows great potential for developing low-cost, portable, and automated EWOD DMFs in large-scale.},

This allows online investigation of the frequency dependence of electrowetting by means of impedance spectroscopy. The EWOD electrode is based on a dielectric bilayer consisting of an anodic tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) thin film (d = 59.35 nm) with a high relative permittivity ({$\varepsilon$}d = 26.3) and a self-assembled hydrophobic silane monolayer. The frequency dependence of electrowetting was studied using an aqueous {$\mu$}L-sized sessile droplet on the planar EWOD electrode in oil. Experiments using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and optical imaging indicate the frequency dependence of all three variables in the YoungLippmann equation: the voltage drop across the dielectric layers, capacitance per unit area, and contact angle under voltage. The electrowetting behavior induced by AC voltages is shown to be well described by the Young-Lippmann equation for AC applications below a frequency threshold. Moreover, the dielectric layers act as a capacitor and the stored electrostatic potential energy is revealed to only partially contribute to the electrowetting.},

Like the development of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology (the standard technique for NAT), the detection signal of fully integrated NAT devices has evolved from qualitative to quantitative and recently to digital readout, aiming at expanding their extensive applications through gradually improving detection sensitivity and accuracy. This review firstly introduces the existing commercial products, and then illustrates recent fully integrated microfluidic devices for NAT at POC from the aspect of detection signals (i.e., qualitative, quantitative and digital). Importantly, the key issues of existing commercial products and the main challenges between scientific research and product development are discussed.

  abstract = {A digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) is an attractive technology platform for automating laboratory procedures in biochemistry. However, today's DMFBs suffer from several limitations: (i) constraints on droplet size and the inability to vary droplet volume in a fine-grained manner; (ii) the lack of integrated sensors for real-time detection; (iii) the need for special fabrication processes and reliability/yield concerns. To overcome the above problems, DMFBs based on a micro-electrode-dot-array (MEDA) architecture have recently been demonstrated. However, due to the inherent differences between today's DMFBs and MEDA, existing synthesis solutions cannot be utilized for MEDA-based biochips. We present the first biochip synthesis approach that can be used for MEDA. The proposed synthesis method targets operation scheduling, module placement, routing of droplets of various sizes, and diagonal movement of droplets in a two-dimensional array. Simulation results using benchmarks and experimental results using a fabricated MEDA biochip demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed co-optimization technique.},

  abstract = {Biophysical markers of cells such as cellular electrical and mechanical properties have been proven as promising label-free biomarkers for studying, characterizing, and classifying different cell types and even their subpopulations. Further analysis or manipulation of specific cell types or subtypes requires accurate isolation of them from the original heterogeneous samples. However, there is currently a lack of cell sorting ability that could actively separate a large number of individual cells at the single-cell level based on their multivariate biophysical makers or phenotypes. In this work, we, for the first time, demonstrate label-free and highthroughput acoustic single-cell sorting activated by the characterization of multivariate biophysical phenotypes. Electrical phenotyping is implemented by single-cell electrical impedance characterization with two pairs of differential sensing electrodes, while mechanical phenotyping is performed by extracting the transit time for the single cell to pass through microconstriction from the recorded impedance signals. A real-time impedance signal processing and triggering algorithm has been developed to identify the target sample population and activate a pulsed highly focused surface acoustic wave for single-cell level sorting. We have demonstrated acoustic single-particle sorting solely based on electrical or mechanical phenotyping. Furthermore, we have applied the developed microfluidic system to sort live MCF-7 cells from a mixture of fixed and live MCF-7 population activated by a combined electrical and mechanical phenotyping at a high throughput {$>$}100 cells/s and purity {$\sim$}91.8\%. This demonstrated ability to analyze and sort cells based on multivariate biophysical phenotyping provides a solution to the current challenges of cell purification that lack specific molecular biomarkers.},

A multi-level photolithographic process is commonly employed to provide multilayer interconnections in integrated circuit devices, but it is often too expensive for large-area or disposable devices frequently needed for microfluidics. The printed circuit board (PCB) can provide multilayer interconnection at low cost, but its rough topography poses a challenge for small droplets to slide over. Here we report a low-cost fabrication of low-topography multilayer interconnects by selective and controlled anodization of thin-film metal layers. The process utilizes anodization of metal (tantalum in this paper) or, more specifically, repetitions of a partial anodization to form insulation layers between conductive layers and a full anodization to form isolating regions between electrodes, replacing the usual process of depositing, planarizing, and etching insulation layers. After verifying the electric connections and insulations as intended, the developed method is applied to electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD), whose complex microfluidic products are currently built on PCB or thin-film transistor substrates. To demonstrate the utility, we fabricate a three metal-layer EWOD device with steps (surface topography) less than 1 micrometer (vs. {$>$} 10 micrometers of PCB EWOD devices) and confirm basic digital microfluidic operations.},

It is urgently necessary to develop rapid, convenient, and cost-effective pointof-care testing (POCT) technologies for the early diagnosis and control of the plague's transmission. Developing POCT methods and related devices is critical for achieving point-of-care diagnosis.

Furthermore, various microfluidicbased assays for diagnosing COVID-19 are summarized, including immunoassays, such as ELISA, and molecular assays, such as PCR. Finally, the challenges of and future perspectives on microfluidic device design and development are presented.

  abstract = {A digital microfluidic system based on electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) technology has attracted considerable attention because of its promising potential in biological, biochemical and biomedical applications. The digital microfluidic (EWOD) system enables a discrete droplet to be manipulated through reconfigurable paths or channels defined by electrode actuation. Minute sample and reagent volume, precise droplet control, low energy consumption, low cost, rapid analysis, portablility for point-of-care diagnosis, flexibility for integrating with detector, multiple-step and simultaneous reaction processes are all advantages of EWOD system. Thus, it has become a promising and popular tool for bio-applications such as cell assays, proteomics, enzyme assays, immunoassays, DNA extraction, DNA repair and DNA amplification. In DNAbased applications, ordinarily, the DNA replication (e.g., DNA amplification) is necessary. Among the DNA replication techniques, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) because of its simplicity and cost-effectiveness is the most common laboratory technique. Therefore, the development of EWOD-based microfluidic PCR system combined with other novel techniques for DNA amplification or DNA-based assays has extensively been reported. In this paper, the recent developments and studies of EWOD microfluidic system for DNAbased applications published in the last five years have been reviewed.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) have become popular in the healthcare industry recently because of its lowcost, high-throughput, and portability. Users can execute the experiments on biochips with high resolution, and the biochips market therefore grows significantly. However, malicious attackers exploit Intellectual Property (IP) piracy and Trojan attacks to gain illegal profits. The conventional approaches present defense mechanisms that target either IP piracy or Trojan attacks. In practical, DMFBs may suffer from the threat of being attacked by these two attacks at the same time. This paper presents a comprehensive security system to protect DMFBs from IP piracy and Trojan attacks. We propose an authentication mechanism to protect IP and detect errors caused by Trojans with CCD cameras. By our security system, we could generate secret keys for authentication and determine whether the bioassay is under the IP piracy and Trojan attacks. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our security system without overhead of the bioassay completion time.},

The droplets, containing DNA, a ligation enzyme and a multi-salt reaction buffer, served to complete the ligation using a developed EWOD system. In order to reduce the effect from environment, so the concept of core-shell droplet was used in this study. Droplets of ultramicro volume (0.3{$\mu$}L) were successfully generated from reservoirs between one plate with coplanar electrodes and another plate with a hydrophobic surface free of electrodes. In one successful cloning, the total usage of reagents in an ultramicro-volume EWOD chip was 2.1{$\mu$}L; no volume was wasted, in comparison with 85\% waste with the standard protocol (15{$\mu$}L). The results also show that the four parallel DNA ligation processes were accomplished without damage to the chip surface and without biomaterial annulment.},

  abstract = {EWOD (electrowetting-on-dielectric) and LDEP (liquid dielectrophoresis) are investigated to provide digital and analog microfluidic functions on an integrated chip respectively. By altering the frequency of the applied voltage and the surrounding medium of a EWOD device, we found that when using oil as surrounding medium and applying an AC signal 100 kHz, liquid column would be drawn and follow the thin connecting lines of the EWOD driving electrodes instead of remaining on top of the center of the EWOD driving electrodes. This new phenomenon is described in this paper and is regarded as a LDEP effect. Three fundamental tools for integrated digital and analog microfluidics are developed, including a digital-to-analog converter, an analog-to-digital converter, and a valve. Combining EWOD and LDEP effects, liquids can be pumped on a virtual channel (analog microfluidics), defined by energized thin LDEP electrode lines, continuously from liquid reservoir or from a digitized droplet (digital microfluidics). On the contrary, liquids on LDEP electrodes (analog microfluidics) can also be pumped on a EWOD electrode and be digitized in droplet forms with precise volumes (digital microfluidics). EWOD and LDEP can be selectively programmed on a single chip, making integrated digital and analog microfluidics a reality.},

Dispensing 300 pl droplets from 140 nl closed on-chip reservoirs was accomplished with as little as 11.4 V solely through EWD forces, and the actuation threshold voltage was 7.2 V with a 1 Hz voltage switching rate between electrodes. EWD devices were fabricated with a multilayer insulator consisting of 135 nm sputtered tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) and 180 nm parylene C coated with 70 nm of CYTOP. Furthermore, the minimum actuation threshold voltage followed a previously published scaling model for the threshold voltage, VT, which is proportional to (t/{$\varepsilon$}r)1/2, where t and {$\varepsilon$}r are the insulator thickness and dielectric constant respectively. Device threshold voltages are compared for several insulator thicknesses (200 nm, 500 nm, and 1 m), different dielectric materials (parylene C and tantalum pentoxide), and homogeneous versus heterogeneous compositions. Additionally, we used a two-level-metal fabrication process, which enables the fabrication of smaller and denser electrodes with high interconnect routing flexibility. We also have achieved low dispensing and actuation voltages for scaled devices with 30 pl droplets.},

In this study, the physical scaling of electrodes for 33 m and 21 m EWD devices resulted in droplets of 12 pl and 5 pl being dispensed respectively in conjunction with 3 m SU8 gaskets. The stacked multi-layer insulators in the actuators consisted of 200 nm tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) and 200 nm parylene C films deposited and coated with 70 nm of CYTOP. The voltages for dispensing droplets on chips without any external pressure sources are 17.1 Vrms and 22 Vrms for these two sets of devices. A 12 pl droplet can be split into two 6 pl daughter droplets at 18.7 Vrms with 33 m electrode devices. Droplet manipulation is also demonstrated with paramagnetic beads and buffer solutions with proteins. In addition, electrodes with interlocking protrusions and special featured reservoir gasket are designed to facilitate droplet dispensing on these scaled EWD devices. In order to improve sealing of the two-piece sandwich EWD structure, a soft material, Norland Optical Adhesive (NOA), was coated on the top plate along with pressure on top. We demonstrate that based on fundamental theories and experiments, the dimensional scaling of EWD devices has not yet met a limitation as long as the EWD device can be sealed well.},

This review focuses on recent progress in the microfluidic fabrication of fluorescent nanomaterials. Firstly, based on the type of the energy coupling, the existing microfluidic configurations for synthesizing nanomaterials are summarized and categorized. Afterwards, typical examples are shown to demonstrate how fluorescent nanomaterials, including semiconductor nanocrystals, carbon dots, metal nanoparticles, rare earth doped nanophosphors, perovskite nanocrystals, and fluorescent oxide composites, are fabricated. Furthermore, the development directions of microfluidic-based nanofabrication in the future are prospected.

  abstract = {Applying microfluidic patterning, droplets were precisely generated on an electrowettingon-dielectric (EWOD) chip considering these parameters: number of generating electrodes, number of cutting electrodes, voltage, frequency and gap between upper and lower plates of the electrode array on the EWOD chip. In a subsequent patterning experiment, an environment with three generating electrodes, one cutting electrode and a gap height 10 {\textmu}m, we obtained a quantitative volume for patterning. Propylene carbonate liquid and a mixed colloid of polyphthalate carbonate (PPC) and photosensitive polymer material were manipulated into varied patterns. With support from a Z-axis lifting platform and a UV lamp, a cured 3D structure was stacked. Using an EWOD system, a multi-layer three-dimensional structure was produced for the patterning. A two-plate EWOD system patterned propylene carbonate in a quantitative volume at 140 Vpp/20 kHz with automatic patterning.},

Here, we demonstrate fabrication of paper-based EWOD devices using cellulose paper as substrate and paraffin wax as dielectric hydrophobic layer by a simple pressing treatment for the cellulose paper and melting or spray-coating of paraffin wax. We optimized the key fabrication parameters according to the surface morphology and hydrophobicity of the obtained wax film, including the pressing pressure, thermal annealing temperature and amount of paraffin wax. Moreover, the EWOD devices fabricated by the spray-coating method demonstrate larger contact angle changes but with smaller contact angle hysteresis under DC electric field when compared with the devices fabricated by the melting method. Our study opens up potential fabrication of hybrid paper-based microfluidic device combining advantages of continuous-flow and electrowetting using cellulose paper and paraffin wax.},

In this work, we developed a pen-on-paper (PoP) strategy based on two custom-made pens, i.e., a wax pen and a conductive-ink pen, to fully write paper-based microfluidic biosensors through directly writing both microfluidic channels and electrodes. Particularly, the proposed wax pen is competent to realize one-step fabrication of wax channels on paper, as the melted wax penetrates into paper during writing process without any post-treatments. The practical applications of the fabricated paper-based microfluidic biosensors are demonstrated by both colorimetric detection of Salmonella typhimurium DNA with detection limit of 1 nM and electrochemical measurement of glucose with detection limit of 1 mM. The developed PoP strategy for making microfluidic biosensors on paper characterized by true simplicity, prominent portability and excellent capability for rapid prototyping shows promising prospect in POCT applications.},

More recently, DMFBs based on a microelectrode-dot-array (MEDA) architecture have been proposed, and droplet manipulations on MEDA biochips have also been experimentally demonstrated. In order to ensure robust fluidic operations and high confidence in the outcome of biochemical experiments, MEDA biochips must be adequately tested before they can be used for bioassay execution. This paper presents the first approach for testing of MEDA biochips that include both CMOS circuits and microfluidic components. We first present structural test techniques to evaluate the pass/fail status of each microcell (droplet actuation, droplet maintenance, and droplet sensing) and identify faulty microcells. In order to ensure correct operation of functional units, e.g., mixers and diluters, we also present functional test techniques to address fundamental MEDA operations, such as droplet dispensing, transportation, mixing, and splitting. We evaluate the proposed test methods using simulations as well as experiments for fabricated MEDA biochips.},

Such chips achieve ``lab-on-paper'' instead of traditional ``lab-onchips''. The paper substrate is attractive because it is costeffective, easy to use and disposable, fully compatible with most medical/biochemical applications, and offering liquid flow by capillary without being relied on external forces and equipment. Test methods for digital microfluidic (DMF) biochips have been studied for years; however, they are developed for traditional DMF chips and thus are not directly applicable to paper-based DMF (PB-DMF) chips. In PB-DMF chips, electrodes are control wires are printed on the same paper surface, while electrodes can be placed with custom structure. In this paper, we present test and diagnosis methods for faults in PB-DMF. A design-fordiagnosability scheme is proposed, and it is shown that single faults can be located and tolerated by providing alternative paths in PB-DMF chips. The feasibility of the proposed method is validated through experiments.},

However, the complexity of drop manipulation and sample preparation on-chip has limited its incorporation into daily workflow. In this paper, we report a novel method for flexible sample delivery on digital microfluidics in a wide volume range spanning four orders of magnitude from picoliters to nanoliters. The method is based on the phenomenon of satellite droplet ejection, triggered by a sudden change in the strength of the electric field across a drop on a hydrophobic dielectric surface. By precisely modulating the actuation signal with convenient external electric controls, satellite droplet ejection can be turned on to dispense samples or turned off to transport picking-up drops. A pico-dosing design is presented and validated in this work to demonstrate the direct and flexible on-chip sample delivery. This approach could pave the way for the acceptance of microfluidics as a common platform for daily reactions to realize lab-on-a-chip.},

Especially, redox and catalytic active sites introduced by use of active metal ions and/or ligands endow MOFs with the functions of electrochemical sensing. Moreover, precise chemical modification of functional molecules and immobilization with metal nanoparticles, carbon nanostructures and biomolecules could promote their electrochemical performances. In this review, we focus on recent progress achieved in MOF research with respect to general sensing principles and analytical performances of electrochemical sensors. The evaluation and challenges governing the detection of the assays are also discussed.},

AI has been involved in many disciplines, such as medicine, materials, energy, and economics. The development of AI requires the support of many kinds of data, and microfluidic systems can often mine object data on a large scale to support AI. Due to the excellent synergy between the two technologies, excellent research results have emerged in many fields.

However, complex liquid handling schemes are troublesome, especially when scaling up to perform multiple different reactions simultaneously. Digital microfluidic (DMF) technology can operate a single droplet by controlling its movement, mixing, separation, and some other actions, and is a suitable scaffold for cell-free reactions with higher efficiency. In this paper, a commercial DMF board, OpenDrop, was used, and DMF technology               via               remote real-time control inspired by the Internet of Things (IoT) was developed for detecting glucose enzyme catalytic cell-free reactions and verifying the feasibility of programmed cell-free protein expression. A cell-free biological reaction process which can be remote-controlled visually with excellent interactivity, controllability and flexibility was achieved. As proof-of-concept research, this work proposed a new control interface for single-drop cell-free biological reactions. It is much like the ``droplet operation desktop'' concept, used for remote-controllable operations and distributions of cell-free biology for efficient biological screening and protein synthesis in complex reaction networks, with expanded operability and less artificial interference.},

Dielectric breakdown of several typical polymeric and inorganic insulators employed as dielectrics for EWOD has been analytically investigated, which is forced to occur between the electrodes and conductive liquids under certain threshold potential. The electric breakdown occurring in both dielectric layer and surrounding medium (air or silicon oil) has been studied to build up a mathematical model of breakdown voltage as a function of dielectric thickness.

  abstract = {Droplet microfluidics is a powerful method used to characterize chemical reactions at high throughput. Often detection is performed via in-line optical readout, which puts high demands on the detection system or makes detection of low concentration substrates challenging. Here, we have developed a droplet acoustofluidic chip for time-controlled reactions that can be combined with off-line optical readout. The principle of the platform is demonstrated by the enzymatic conversion of fluorescein diphosphate to fluorescein by alkaline phosphatase. The novelty of this work is that the time of the enzymatic reaction is controlled by physically removing the enzymes from the droplets instead of using chemical inhibitors. This is advantageous as inhibitors could potentially interact with the readout. Droplets containing substrate were generated on the chip, and enzyme-coupled microbeads were added into the droplets via pico-injection. The reaction starts as soon as the enzyme/bead complexes are added, and the reaction is stopped when the microbeads are removed from the droplets at a channel bifurcation. The encapsulated microbeads were focused in the droplets by acoustophoresis during the split, leaving the product in the side daughter droplet to be collected for the analysis (without beads). The time of the reaction was controlled by using different outlets, positioned at different lengths from the pico-injector. The enzymatic conversion could be measured with fluorescence readout in a separate PDMS based assay chip. We show the ability to perform time-controlled enzymatic assays in droplet microfluidics coupled to an off-line optical readout, without the need of enzyme inhibitors.},

This process has garnered widespread research attention due to the wide breadth of flexible applications such as medical diagnostics, drug delivery, and digital microfluidics. The rational design of functional surfaces that can achieve the subtle control of liquid behavior. Previous studies were mainly dependent on the special asymmetric structures, which inevitably have the problem of slow transport speed and short distance. To improve controllability, researchers have attempted to use external fields, such as thermal, light, electric fields, and magnetic fields, to achieve controllable droplet transport. On the fundamental side, much of their widespread applicably is due to the degree of control over droplet transport. This review provides an overview of recent progress in the last three years toward the transport of droplets with different mechanisms induced by various external stimuli, including light, electric, thermal, and magnetic field. First, the relevant basic theory and typical induced gradient for directional liquid transport are illustrated. We will then review the latest advances in the external-fieldinduced directional transport. Moreover, the most emerging applications such as digital microfluidics, harvesting of energy and water, heat transfer, and oil/water separation are also presented. Finally, we will outline possible future perspectives to attract more researchers interest and promote the development of this field.},

  abstract = {In this work, for the first time, we demonstrate nanoscale droplet generation from a continuous electrowetting microchannel using a simple and precise imagebased droplet volume metering technique. One of the most popular ways of droplet generation in electrowetting devices is to split a droplet from a preloaded volume as a fluid reservoir. This method is effective, but lowers volume consistency after multiple droplets are generated. Impedance- and capacitance-based methods of volume metering have been successfully used in digital microfluidics, but require complex circuitry and feedback signal processing. In this work, we demonstrate nanoliter droplet generation from a continuous electrowetting channel used as a replenishable fluid reservoir which compensates for the loss of reservoir volume as droplets are sequentially split. This improves volume consistency especially for applications requiring multi-droplet generation. Based on the area of the electrode, the volume of each droplet split from the electrowetting channel can be obtained by a simple and precise image processing technique with no need for additional hardware and measurement errors of {\textpm}0.05 \%. This simple technique can be used in a wide range of applications that require precise volume metering, such as immunoassay.},

  abstract = {Sample preparation plays an essential role in most biochemical reactions. Raw reactants are diluted to solutions with desirable concentration values in this process. Since the reactants, like infant's blood, DNA evidence collected from crime scenes, or costly reagents, are extremely valuable, their usage should be minimized whenever possible. In this paper, we propose a two-phased reactant minimization algorithm (REMIA), for sample preparation on digital microfluidic biochips. In the former phase, REMIA builds a reactant-minimized interpolated dilution tree with specific leaf nodes for a target concentration. Two approaches are developed for tree construction; one is based on integer linear programming (ILP) and the other is heuristic. The ILP one guarantees to produce an optimal dilution tree with minimal reactant consumption, whereas the heuristic one ensures runtime efficiency. Then, REMIA constructs a forest consisting of exponential dilution trees to produce those aforementioned specific leaf nodes with minimal reactant consumption in the latter phase. Experimental results show that REMIA achieves a reduction of reactant usage by 32\%--52\% as compared with three existing state-of-the-art sample preparation approaches. Besides, REMIA can be easily extended to solve the sample preparation problem with multiple target concentrations, and the extended version also effectively lowers the reactant consumption further.},

Supercapacitor, as one of the most hopeful appearing energy storage devices, can provide a wonderful alternative to batteries or electrolytic capacitors, owing to its fast charge and discharge rates, high power density, and long cycling stability. Especially for the recently developed micro-supercapacitors, the unique in-plane interdigital electrode architecture can fully meet the integration requirements of rapidly developed miniaturized electronic devices, and improve the power density of the unit via shortening the ionic diffusion distance between the interdigital electrodes. This concept introduces the recent advances on the design, fabrication, and application of planar micro-supercapacitors for on-chip energy storage from an overall perspective.

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic chips are liquid processors that perform biochemical assays by moving, merging and splitting droplets using the electrowetting effect. Yet, hardwiring electrowetting chips becomes tedious as soon as they include more than a few dozen electrodes. Single-sided continuous opto-electrowetting, where the electrowetting effect of a featureless semiconductor film is controlled by light patterns is a promising solution to this hardwiring bottleneck, but so far two-dimensional manipulation of droplets is still difficult. Here, we demonstrate the manipulation of droplets along arbitrary directions by using Z-shaped light patterns that rotate the electric field by an arbitrary angle. We provide a theoretical model for driving droplets in different directions. It is verified by Comsol simulations and experiments. Optimization of the width of the notches provides quite large increase of the driving voltage in the y-direction. The chip can move dyed water droplets in the y-direction at a maximum speed of 4.86 mm/s. Such multidimensional droplet driving opens new possibilities for single-sided continuous optoelectrowetting such as merging droplets that are not in line, efficient droplet mixing, and bypassing droplets to avoid coalescence.},

For this purpose, one test set should have maximum 2 to 3 mixed components solution. So the different solution preparation modes and reagents combination were studied. The investigation results showed that the 2 mixed solution mode was impossibly prepared because nitropruside was decomposed in strong oxidative solution such as hypochlorite and increased color intensity when mixed with thymol in strong alkaline solution by ageing. The 3 mixed solution mode was proposed and optimal components mixing was fount i. e. solution 1 is nitropruside in ammonia free water; solution 2 is hypochlorite in carbonate buffer at pH 10 and solution 3 is thymol and EDTA in 2M of sodium hydroxide. This 3 solution test set was used for ammonia quick determination. Following proposed test procedure, the full color creation takes less than 5 minutes and total time for one test is approximately 7 -- 8 minutes. The ammonia concentration in different samples determined by photometric and visual method using 3 solution test set were compared with conventional spectrophotometric method. The measured values showed that analytical results were agreed each with other and the proposed test set could be used as test-kit for field measurement or common monitoring ammonia in fresh and drinking water. The maximum relative error is less than 25\%.},

However, existing diagnostic instruments usually require costly reagents, long analysis time, established lab infrastructure, and trained professionals to operate, which limits their availability for large-scale screening applications in developed countries and primary care in developing countries. There is a strong demand for robust, cost-effective, and simple-to-operate instruments for molecular diagnostics. The features of microfluidics, such as short analysis time, reduction in fabrication costs, and low sample/reagent consumption, make it a natural fit for the development of new diagnostic instruments. Herein, selected work is highlighted to provide a snapshot of microfluidic devices developed for molecular diagnostics in the past 5 years, specifically focusing on their applications for the detection of agents clinically relevant to cancers, cardiac conditions, and infectious diseases, and an outlook on how microfluidics technology can be further advanced for applications in this area.},

The Raspberry Pi camera platform makes automated, controlled imaging affordable with accessible customisation. When combined with open source software and open-source 3D printed hardware, the control over image quality and capture of this platform permits the rapid development of novel instrumentation. Here we present ``PiRamid'', a compact, portable, and inexpensive enclosure for autonomous imaging both in the laboratory and in the field. The modular three-piece 3D printed design makes it easy to incorporate different camera systems or lighting configurations (e.g., single wavelength LED for fluorescence). The enclosed design allows complete control of illumination unlike a conventional digital camera or smartphone, on a tripod or handheld, under ambient lighting. The stackable design permits rapid sample addition or camera focus adjustment, with a corresponding change in magnification and resolution. The entire unit is small enough to fit within a microbiological incubator, and cheap enough ( {\pounds}100) to scale out for larger parallel experiments. Simply, Python scripts fully automate illumination and image capture for small-scale experiments with an 110 85 mm area at 70--90 lm resolution. We demonstrate the versatility of PiRamid by capturing time-resolved, quantitative image data for a wide range of assays. Bacterial growth kinetics was captured for conventional microbiology (agar Petri dishes), 3D printed custom microbiology labware and microfluidic microbiology. To illustrate application beyond microbiology, we demonstrate time-lapse imaging of crystal growth and degradation of salad leaves. Minor modifications permit epi-illumination by addition of a LED ring to the camera module. We conclude that PiRamid permits inexpensive digital capture and quantitation of a wide range of experiments by time-lapse imaging to simplify both laboratory and field imaging.},

The drop position is determined measuring the equivalent capacitance of the EWOD electrode, whose value varies according to the presence of the fluid over the pad. In the presented system, the capacitance measurement is achieved through the ``Frequency Shift Oscillator'' method: the EWOD electrode is inserted in an oscillator circuit, whose operating frequency is inversely proportional to the electrode capacitance value. A microcontroller, included in the system, counts the number of rising edges at the output of the circuit determining the oscillation frequency. The oscillator has been simulated and subsequently fabricated on a double layer printed circuit board. A very good agreement between simulations and experiments has been achieved. The value of obtained sensitivity is not lower than 1.2 kHz/pF that corresponds to a minimum detectable capacitance variation of 0.167 pF. This value is well below the variation of capacitance due to the presence of the droplet above the EWOD electrode and demonstrates the suitability of our circuit as a successful drop position sensor.},

Programming DMFBs has historically been accomplished by writing low-level bit manipulations to select which electrodes should activate in sequence. Recent research on high-level programming languages and compilers for DMFBs have begun to address the programmability challenge, but important capabilities such as loading and executing pre-compiled libraries and function calls, are absent from the literature. A primary driver of this oversight is the lack of a memory hierarchy to store physical chemicals off-chip to jump to and from function calls. This paper addresses the complexities involved in compiling function calls within the technology's unique boundaries, and provides a proof-of-concept implementation from language to code generation, with solutions evaluated using a cycleaccurate DMFB simulator as well as physical execution on an open-hardware DMFB.},

This article reviews the literature data on variation of water quality in rivers, lakes, and ex-mining ponds in Malaysia and other selected countries. World Health Organization (WHO), United States Environmental Protection Agency, and Malaysian water quality standards (INWQS) are used as the baseline for the pollution and health risk assessments. It illustrates that concentrations of Pb, Cd, and As in lakes and ex-mining ponds, and Mn, Cd and Pb in rivers exceed permissible limits for direct consumption. The levels of dissolved oxygen, TSS, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) are not within WHO and INWQS limits, pH of lakes and ex-mining ponds are lower than reference standards while that of rivers are high. Principal component analysis reveals that TSS, COD, BOD, Pb, and As are highly associated with ex-mining ponds. Cluster analysis shows similarity in pollution source between lake and ex-mining ponds. Risk assessment revealed that high chronic daily intake and metal index were beyond acceptable limit indicating high risk and exposure to toxic metals.},

Chip scale integrated photonic sensing systems that combine optical, electrical, and fluidic functions are especially attractive for sensing applications due to the high sensitivity of optical sensors, the small formfactor of chip scale systems, and the low-cost processing possible for systems fabricated with well-developed mass production techniques. In this paper, a chip scale sensing system, which is composed of a planar integrated optical microdisk resonator and a thin film InGaAs photodetector, is integrated with a digital microfluidic system. This system was designed, fabricated, and experimentally characterized by dispensing and moving droplets of glucose solution from the reservoir to the microresonator sensor. The optical output of the resonator was transduced by the integrated photodetector to an electrical current signal for readout.},

  abstract = {The advent of digital microfluidic lab-on-a-chip (LoC) technology offers a platform for developing diagnostic applications with the advantages of portability, increased automation, low-power consumption, compatibility with mass manufacturing, and high throughput. However, most digital microfluidic platforms incorporate limited optical capabilities (e.g., optical transmission) for integrated sensing, because more complex optical functions are difficult to integrate into the digital microfluidic platform. This follows since the sensor must be compatible with the hydrophobic surfaces on which electrowetting liquid transport occurs. With the emergence of heterogeneous photonic component integration technologies such as those described herein, the opportunity for integrating advanced photonic components has expanded considerably. Many diagnostic applications could benefit from the integration of more advanced miniaturized optical sensing technologies, such as index of refraction sensors (surface plasmon resonance sensors, microresonator sensors, etc.). The advent of these heterogeneous integration technologies, that enable the integration of thin-film semiconductor devices onto arbitrary host substrates, enables more complex optical functions, and in particular, planar optical systems, to be integrated into microfluidic systems. This paper presents an integrated optical sensor based upon the heterogeneous integration of an InGaAs-based thin-film photodetector with a digital microfluidic system. This demonstration of the heterogeneous integration and operation of an active optical thin-film device with a digital microfluidic system is the first step toward the heterogeneous integration of entire planar optical sensing systems on this platform.},

A versatile self-shrinkage assembling (SSA) strategy to directly construct the compact mSCs (CmSCs) from hydrogels of reduced graphene oxide is reported. A single CmSC is only 0.0023 cm               3               in volume, which is significantly smaller than most reported mSCs in fiber/yarn and planar interdigital forms. It exhibits a high capacitance of up to 68.3 F cm               -3               and a superior cycling stability with 98\% capacitance retention after 25\,000 cycles. Most importantly, the SSA technique enables the CmSC as the building block to realize arbitrary, programmable, and multi-dimensional integration for adaptable and complicated power systems. By design on mortise and tenon joint connection, autologous integrated 3D interdigital CmSCs are fabricated in a self-holding-on manner, which thus dramatically reduces the whole device volume to achieve the high-performance capacitive behavior. Consequently, the SSA technique offers a universal and versatile approach for large-scale on-demand integration of mSCs as flexible and transformable power sources.},

In the present work, a combined numerical and experimental approach was employed to study the EW response of a droplet subject to both direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) actuating signals. Computational fluid dynamics models were developed by using the Volume of Fluid (VOF)-Continuous Surface Force (CSF) method. A dynamic contact angle model based on the molecular kinetic theory was implemented as the boundary condition at the moving contact line, which considers the effects of the contact line friction and the pinning force. The droplet shape evolution under DC condition and the interfacial resonance oscillation under AC condition were investigated. It was found that the numerical models were able to accurately predict the key parameters of electrowetting-induced droplet dynamics.},

  abstract = {The active matrix (AM)-based architecture offers many advantages over conventional digital electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) microfluidic biochips, such as the capability of handling variable-size droplets, more flexible droplet movement, and precise control over droplet navigation. However, a major challenge in choosing the routing paths is to decide when the droplets are to be reshaped depending on the congestion of the intended path, or split- and route sub droplets,and merging them at their respective destinations. As the number of microelectrodes in AM-EWOD chips is large, the path selection problem becomes further complicated. In this article, we propose a negotiation-guided flow based on routing of subdroplets that obviates the explicit need for deciding when the droplets are to be manipulated, yet fully utilizing the power of droplet reshaping, splitting, and merging them to facilitate their journey. The proposed algorithm reduces routing cost and provides more freedom in deadlock avoidance in the presence of multiple routing tasks by assigning certain congestion penalty for sibling subdroplets and fluidic penalty for heterogeneous droplets. Compared to existing techniques, it reduces latest arrival time by an average of 29\% for several benchmark and random test suites. Furthermore, our method is observed to provide 100\% routability of nets for all test cases, whereas existing and baseline routers fail to produce feasible solutions in many instances. We also propose a reliable mode droplet routing strategy where the number of unreliable splitting operations can be reduced by paying a small penalty on latest arrival time.},

In view of these advantages, the integration of microfluidic and biosensor technologies provides the ability to merge chemical and biological components into a single platform and offers new opportunities for future biosensing applications including portability, disposability, real-time detection, unprecedented accuracies, and simultaneous analysis of different analytes in a single device. This review aims at representing advances and achievements in the field of microfluidic-based biosensing. The review also presents examples extracted from the literature to demonstrate the advantages of merging microfluidic and biosensing technologies and illustrate the versatility that such integration promises in the future biosensing for emerging areas of biological engineering, biomedical studies, point-of-care diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and precision agriculture.},

However, synthesis algorithms and biochip design methods proposed in the literature are oblivious to completion-time uncertainties in fluidic operations, and they do not meet the requirements of cyberphysical integration in digital microfluidics. We present an operation-interdependency-aware synthesis method that uses frequency scaling and is responsive to uncertainties that are inherent in the completion times of fluidic operations such as mixing and thermal cycling. Using this design approach, we can carry out dynamic on-line decision making for the execution of fluidic operations in response to detector feedback. We use three common laboratorial protocols to demonstrate that, compared to uncertainty-oblivious biochip design, the proposed dynamic decision making approach is more effective in satisfying realistic physical constraints. As a result, it decreases the likelihood of erroneous reaction outcomes, and it leads to reduced time-to-results, less repetition of reaction steps, and less wastage of precious samples and reagents.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic biochips are being increasingly used for biotechnology applications. The number of control pins used to drive electrodes is a major contributor to fabrication cost for disposable biochips in a highly cost-sensitive market. Most prior work on pin-constrained biochip design determines the mapping of a small number of control pins to a larger number of electrodes according to the specific schedule of fluid-handling operations and routing paths of droplets. Such designs are therefore specific to the bioassay application, hence sacrificing some of the flexibility associated with digital microfluidics. We propose a design method to generate an application-independent pin-assignment configuration with a minimum number of control pins. Layouts of a commercial biochip and laboratory prototypes are used as case studies to evaluate the proposed design method for determining a suitable pin-assignment configuration. Compared with previous pin-assignment algorithms, the proposed method can reduce the number of control pins and facilitate the ``general-purpose'' use of digital microfluidic biochips for a wide range of applications.},

To improve droplet transport efficiency, this study proposes a heuristic-elite genetic algorithm (HEGA) for droplet path planning. We introduce a heuristic method and a bidirectional elite fragment recombination method to address the challenge of poor initialization quality in genetic algorithms, particularly in complex environments. These approaches aim to enhance the global search capability and accelerate the algorithm's convergence. Simulations were performed using MATLAB, and the results indicate that compared to the basic ant colony algorithm, the proposed method reduces the average number of turning points by approximately 17.23\% and the average search time by about 92.60\%. In multi-droplet transport applications, the algorithm generates optimal paths for test droplets while maintaining fast convergence. Additionally, it effectively prevents droplets from accidentally contacting or merging in non-synthesis areas, ensuring improved testing outcomes for the chip.},

  abstract = {Abstract             A digital microfluidic system based on electrowetting-on-dielectric is a new technology for controlling microliter-sized droplets on a plane. By applying a voltage signal to an electrode, the droplets can be controlled to move, merge, and split. Due to device design, fabrication, and runtime uncertainties, feedback control schemes are necessary to ensure the reliability and accuracy of a digital microfluidic system for practical application. The premise of feedback is to obtain accurate droplet position information. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop a digital microfluidics system integrated with driving, position, and feedback functions for different areas of study. In this article, we propose a driving and feedback scheme based on machine vision for the digital microfluidics system. A series of experiments including droplet motion, merging, status detection, and self-adaption are performed to evaluate the feasibility and the reliability of the proposed scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can accurately locate multiple droplets and improve the success rate of different applications. Furthermore, the proposed scheme provides an experimental platform for scientists who focused on the digital microfluidics system.},

  abstract = {Microfluidic systems are part of an emerging technology which deals with minute amounts of liquids (biological samples and reagents) on a small scale. They are fast, compact and can be made into a highly integrated system to deliver sample purification, separation, reaction, immobilization, labelling, as well as detection, thus are promising for applications such as lab-on-a-chip and handheld healthcare devices. Miniaturized micropumps typically consist of a moving-part component, such as a membrane structure, to deliver liquids, and are often unreliable, complicated in structure and difficult to be integrated with other control electronics circuits. The trend of new-generation micropumps is moving-part-free micropumps operated by advanced techniques, such as electrokinetic force, surface tension/energy, acoustic waves. This paper reviews the development and advances of relevant technologies, and introduces electrowetting-on-dielectrics and acoustic wave-based microfluidics. The programmable electrowetting micropump has been realized to dispense and manipulate droplets in 2D with up to 1000 addressable electrodes and electronics built underneath. The acoustic wave-based microfluidics can be used not only for pumping, mixing and droplet generation but also for biosensors, suitable for single-mechanism-based lab-on-a-chip applications.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic systems (DMFS) are an emerging class of lab-on-a-chip systems that manipulate individual droplets of chemicals on a planar array of electrodes. The biochemical analyses are performed by repeatedly moving, mixing, and splitting droplets on the electrodes. Mixers and storage units, composed of electrodes, are two important functional resources. Mixers perform droplet mixing and splitting operations, while storage units store droplets that have been produced for subsequent mixings. In this paper, we focus on minimizing the completion time of biochemical analyses by exploiting the binary tree representation of analyses to schedule mixing operations. Using pipelining, we overlap mixing operations with input and transportation operations. We find the lower bound of the mixing completion time based on the tree structure of input analyses, and calculate the minimum number of mixers required to achieve the lower bound. We present a scheduling algorithm for the case with a specified number of mixers , and prove it is optimal to minimize the mixing completion time. We also analyze resource constraint issues for two extreme cases. For the case with just one mixer, we prove that all schedules that keep the mixer busy at all times result in the same mixing completion time and then design algorithms for scheduling and to minimize the number of storage units. For the case with zero storage units, we find the minimum number of mixers required. We extend our analyses and algorithms assuming identical mixing durations to the case of different mixing durations. Finally, we illustrate the benefits of our scheduling methods on an example of DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.},

First, the principle of electrowetting applied in small and confined configurations is introduced and the cause of the failure of the dielectric layer is analyzed. Then, the function of the pixel structures is described to avoid display defects. Next, electric signal modulations are compared in terms of achieving good image quality and optical stability. Lastly, the methods are presented for color panel realization. It was concluded that multi-layer dielectrics, three-dimensional pixel structures, proper electric frequency-and-amplitude modulation and an RGB color panel are expected to resolve the current limitations and contribute to designing advanced reflective displays.},

  abstract = {A new type of digital microfluidic platform for influenza A H1N1 virus detection by utilizing a one-aptamer/two-antibodies assay on magnetic beads was reported.           ,              H1N1, a subtype of influenza A virus, has emerged as a global threat in the past decades. Due to its highly infectious nature, an accurate and rapid detection assay is urgently required. Therefore, this study presents a new type of digital microfluidic platform for H1N1 virus detection by utilizing a one-aptamer/two-antibodies assay on magnetic beads. The droplets containing magnetic beads were driven by electromagnetic forces on a structure-free, super-hydrophobic surface to automate the entire assay within 40 min. With different levels of hydrophobic modification, the droplets could be easily controlled and positioned without any assisted microstructure. The tunable electromagnetic forces could be adjusted for three kinds of operating modes for the manipulations of beads and droplets, including movement of droplets containing magnetic beads, mixing of two droplets and beads extraction out of droplets. When compared with previous studies, the manipulations of droplets and magnetic particles in this study are more flexible as they can be easily adjusted by fine-tuning the magnetic flux density. Furthermore, the magnetic beads also served as three-dimensional substrates for the new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-like assay. The magnetic beads were conjugated with aptamers, which have high specificity towards H1N1 viruses such that they could be specifically captured and detected. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was then used to activate tyramide-tetramethylrhodamine (TTMR) such that fluorescent signals could be amplified. With this approach, the limit of detection was experimentally found to be 0.032 hemagglutination units/reaction, which is sensitive enough for clinical diagnostics. This kind of digital microfluidic platform with the ELISA-like assay could effectively reduce the consumption of samples and reagents such that the volume of all droplets including the H1N1 sample, antibodies, TTMR and wash buffers was only 20 {$\mu$}L. This is the first time that a digital microfluidic platform was demonstrated such that the entire diagnostic process for influenza A H1N1 viruses could be performed by using electromagnetic forces, which could be promising for rapid and accurate diagnosis of influenza.},

  abstract = {Microfluidics attracts much attention due to its multiple advantages such as high throughput, rapid analysis, low sample volume, and high sensitivity. Microfluidics has profoundly influenced many fields including chemistry, biology, medicine, information technology, and other disciplines. However, some stumbling stones (miniaturization, integration, and intelligence) strain the development of industrialization and commercialization of microchips. The miniaturization of microfluidics means fewer samples and reagents, shorter times to results, and less footprint space consumption, enabling a high throughput and parallelism of sample analysis. Additionally, micro-size channels tend to produce laminar flow, which probably permits some creative applications that are not accessible to traditional fluid-processing platforms. The reasonable integration of biomedical/physical biosensors, semiconductor microelectronics, communications, and other cutting-edge technologies should greatly expand the applications of current microfluidic devices and help develop the next generation of lab-on-a-chip (LOC). At the same time, the evolution of artificial intelligence also gives another strong impetus to the rapid development of microfluidics. Biomedical applications based on microfluidics normally bring a large amount of complex data, so it is a big challenge for researchers and technicians to analyze those huge and complicated data accurately and quickly. To address this problem, machine learning is viewed as an indispensable and powerful tool in processing the data collected from micro-devices. In this review, we mainly focus on discussing the integration, miniaturization, portability, and intelligence of microfluidics technology.},

Apart from being expensive, many of the detection methods require trained personnel and are often time-consuming. With drastic climate changes, severe droughts, increases in population and pollution of natural water systems, the need to develop ultrasensitive, low-cost and hand-held, point-of-use detection kits to monitor water quality is critical. Although Escherichia coli is still considered the best indicator of water quality, cell numbers may be below detection limits, or the cells may be non-culturable and thus only detected by DNA amplification. A number of different biosensors have been developed to detect viable, dead or non-culturable microbial cells and chemicals in water. This review discusses the differences in these biosensors and evaluates the application of microfluidics in the design of ultra-sensitive nano-biosensors.},

A model system of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) film on a platinum wire electrode in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) solution is used to demonstrate the method. First, a library of circuits is created which may model the physical processes occurring in the system. Next, each circuit is fit to the experimental data collected from three replicate experiments. Finally, relative residual errors, generated circuit parameter values relating to known physical parameters (solution resistance, double-layer capacitance, etc.) and standard deviations based on replicate experiments are used to determine which circuit best models the electrochemical data. For the model system presented in this paper, it is found that a modified Randles circuit best models the data when no BSA film is present, and that an additional time constant (resistor and constant phase element in parallel), modeling a porous, insulating film, is needed when a BSA film is formed on the electrode surface.},

  abstract = {We study the thermocapillary migration of two-dimensional droplets of partially wetting liquids on a non-uniformly heated surface. The effect of a non-zero contact angle is imposed through a disjoining--conjoining pressure term. The numerical results for two different molecular interactions are compared: on the one hand, London--van der Waals and ionic--electrostatics molecular interactions that account for polar liquids; on the other hand, long- and short-range molecular forces that model molecular interactions of non-polar fluids. In addition, the effect of gravity on the velocity of the drop is analysed. We find that for small contact angles, the long-time dynamics is independent of the molecular potential, and the footprint of the droplet increases with the square root of time. For intermediate contact angles we observe that polar droplets are more likely to break up into smaller volumes than non-polar ones. A linear stability analysis allows us to predict the number of droplets after breakup occurs. In this regime, the effect of gravity is stabilizing: it reduces the growth rates of the unstable modes and increases the shortest unstable wavelength. When breakup is not observed, the droplet moves steadily with a profile that consists in a capillary ridge followed by a film of constant thickness, for which we find power law dependencies with the cross-sectional area of the droplet, the contact angle and the temperature gradients. For large contact angles, non-polar liquids move faster than polar ones, and the velocity is proportional to the Marangoni stress. We find power law dependencies for the velocity for the different regimes of flow. The numerical results allow us to shed light on experimental facts such as the origin of the elongation of droplets and the existence of saturation velocity.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on theory and computational modelling of lab-on-a-disc devices of relevance for novel applications discovery and optimal designs.           ,              Centrifugal microfluidic platforms or lab-on-discs (LODs) have evolved into a popular technology for automating chemical and biological assays. LODs today enable scientists to implement and integrate different operational units, including fluid mixing, droplet generation, cell-sorting, gene amplification, analyte detection, and so forth. For an efficient design and cost-effective implementation of any microfluidic device, including LODs, theoretical analysis and considerations should play a more important role than they currently do. The theoretical analysis we will show is especially essential to the investigation of detailed phenomena at the small length scales and high-speed typical for LODs where a wide range of forces may be involved. Previous LOD review papers presented mostly experimental results with theory as an afterthought. Hence, a review paper focused on the theoretical aspects, and associated computational studies of LOD devices is an urgent need. In the present review paper, all previous computational studies on LOD devices are categorized as single-phase flows, two-phase flows, network simulation, and solids. For each of these categories, the governing equations and important formulas are presented and explained. Moreover, a handy scaling analysis is introduced to aid scientists when comparing different competing forces in LOD devices. We hope that by surveying and contrasting various theoretical LOD studies, we shed some light on existing controversies and reveal where additional theoretical work is needed.},

Microparticle image velocimetry was used to measure in-plane velocity distributions for PZT excitation voltages that ranged from 0 to 50 VRMS. Intra-droplet streaming velocities in excess of 2.0 mm {$\cdot$} s-1 were observed without droplet breakup or damage to the EWD device layer. Additionally, we found median intradroplet streaming velocity to depend quadratically on PZT excitation voltage up to the stress limit of the interfacial boundary.

As a conventional double-plate EWOD device requires a grounded electrode on the top-plate, it will cause additional fabrication complicity and cost during the encapsulation process. In this work, we found that by carefully designing the electrode arrangement and configuring the driving electronic circuit, the droplet driving force can be maintained with a floating electrode on the top-plate. This can provide the possibilities to integrate additional electrical or electrochemical sensing functions on the top-plate. We use both finite element analysis and the fabricated system to validate the theory, and the results indicate that floating top-electrode EWOD systems are highly reliable and reproducible once the design considerations are fully met.},

There is a growing concern about the presence and impact of EOC as well as the need for reliable and effective water monitoring using sensors capable of detecting the target molecules in complex media. Due to their specificities, such as fast response times, low cost, portability and user-friendly operation, electronic tongue (e-tongue) systems present some advantages over the traditional analytical techniques (e.g., chromatographic systems) used for environmental monitoring. We reviewed e-tongue sensors, focusing on their ability for real-time environmental monitoring. A bibliometric evaluation was carried out, along with a study of the status of the existing e-tongue systems, how they worked, and their applications in different fields.

After reviewing the literature, it is clear that in order to effectively remove species like perchlorate and nitrate on an industrial scale, a new electrochemical reduction method utilising selective electrocatalysts following a stable mechanistic path is necessary. Among the many difficult problems with electrochemical reduction techniques is the requirement to develop economically viable or cost-effective processes. In addition, photo-electrochemical techniques are still in the early stages of study, thus further in-depth investigations are needed to fully understand their potential. It is also difficult to detect these ions in water. Therefore, additional study is needed to develop effective methods for detecting nitrate and perchlorate. Molecular diagnostics, immunoassays, and biochemical analyses have all benefited greatly from point-of-care testing in recent years, particularly in areas with limited access to laboratory facilities. Microfluidic chips offer numerous notable benefits over other point-of-care testing technologies. All steps of a biological reaction---from loading reagents to detecting their presence---can be carried out on a single microprocessor thanks to technology that miniaturises traditional laboratory equipment. This has led to the microfluidic platform being extensively studied in recent decades for applications in environmental monitoring, healthcare, and food safety. In this article, we will take a look back at the most recent developments in the use of microfluidics in immunoassay. There are two components to a microfluidic platform, passive manipulation and active manipulation, that are based on the various fluid driving forces. Active manipulation encompasses the introduction of pressure, centrifugal, electric, optofluidic, magnetic, and digital microfluidics; passive manipulation centres on capillary-driven microfluidics.},

Molecular diagnostics, immunoassays, and biochemical analyses have all benefited greatly from point-of-care testing in recent years, particularly in areas with limited access to laboratory facilities. Microfluidic chips offer numerous notable benefits over other point-of-care testing technologies. All steps of a biological reaction---from loading reagents to detecting their presence---can be carried out on a single microprocessor thanks to technology that miniaturises traditional laboratory equipment. This has led to the microfluidic platform being extensively studied in recent decades for applications in environmental monitoring, healthcare, and food safety. In this article, we will take a look back at the most recent developments in the use of microfluidics in immunoassay. There are two components to a microfluidic platform, passive manipulation and active manipulation, that are based on the various fluid driving forces. Active manipulation encompasses the introduction of pressure, centrifugal, electric, optofluidic, magnetic, and digital microfluidics; passive manipulation centres on capillary-driven microfluidics.},

  abstract = {Aquatic chemical sensors have experienced rapid development in recent years largely due to advances in the fields of nanotechnology. Accurate in situ monitoring of nutrients is fundamental to understanding the biogeochemistry of aquatic ecosystems and is necessary for the sustainable utilization of water resources. Although many sensor technologies can achieve nM detection levels, quality assurance and reliability for long-term sensing in complex environments is still lacking. Furthermore, some sensors suffer from sensitivity to high background ion concentration. This review aims to address these challenges by highlighting recent improvements in aquatic chemical sensors to monitor nitrate (NO3 ), nitrite (NO2 ), ammonium (NH4{\th}), and phosphate (PO43 ) ion concentrations in water. The review critically analyses and compares the performance of these chemical sensors with a particular emphasis on their capability for long-term in situ water monitoring. We also provide an overview on some crucial problems significantly affecting the analytical performance of the sensors. Finally, this review details some recommendations and future directions for improving sensing accuracy and robustness.},

The excitation wavelength-dependent photoluminescence (PL) intensity has shown dual emission peaks at 340 and 380 nm that correspond to two different excitation energy states. The pH-based PL intensity and zeta potential variation were analyzed to optimize the suitable medium for aqueous ammonia sensing. Zeta potential was found to shift from 4 to -21 mV upon changing the pH of the the solution from acidic to alkaline medium. The fluorescence intensity of PANI/MWCNTs was found to increase upon increasing the pH from 3.0 to 6.0 (acidic region) and exhibits a plateau upon further increasing the pH from 7.0 to 12 (basic region). The PANI/MWCNT composite has shown a linear response to aqueous ammonia concentration varying from 25 to 200 {$\mu$}M with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.99 and a limit of detection of 15.19 {$\mu$}M. The presence of relevant interference molecules and physiological ions had no influence on the detection of aqueous ammonia. Fieldlevel study demonstrated that the level of aqueous ammonia can be determined selectively by using the PANI/MWCNT composite for various applications. The mechanism for the selective detection of aqueous ammonia is deliberated in detail.},

In this paper, we are proposing a novel and efficient technique for detecting a single fault and identifying the fault location within the biochip. Along with that it can also calculate the traversal time if the biochip is fault free. The traversal of the microarray is carried out by scanning the intermediate cells and the edges by special types of movement pattern RDRD (Right-Down-Right-Down) and DRDR (DownRight-Down-Right) for left and right diagonal electrode traversal respectively and the boundary cells and edges are traversed in clockwise direction by moving the test droplets. If a fault is detected then the proposed technique also locates it by backtracking the droplet. The simulated result suggests that the proposed technique is efficient and represents significant improvement in fault detection and calculating traversal time of a fault free biochip over existing methods.},

  abstract = {This work reports on a dynamically configurable micro-array surface plasmon resonance biochip platform. The platform comprises a digital electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) microfluidic device tailored to surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi). We demonstrate its application for simultaneous immobilization of different DNA probes at the designated detection sites on-chip from sub- L volume solutions in combination with multichannel label-free real-time detection of subsequent hybridization reactions. Successful on-chip DNA probe dilution and immobilization is also demonstrated using SPRi hybridization detection. Furthermore, active control of the immobilized probe density and orientation is achieved under an applied potential using the electric interface of the EWOD device. For low probe densities, under negative applied potential, the DNA hybridization efficiency is enhanced compared to passive probe immobilization, yielding a two-fold SPR signal increase within only 8 min of hybridization. EWOD microfluidic platform coupled with SPRi promises to dramatically increase the speed of detection and quantification of biomolecular interactions while reducing reagent consumption. The proposed system would enable the development of high-throughput, rapid and ultrasensitive detection of biomolecules beyond DNA microarray applications.},

Depending on electrodes design (circular vs. square electrodes), EWOD-induced convective flow can be observed to switch from toroidal to quadripolar flows. Due to the coplanar geometry of the electrodes, a model can be proposed which helps to interpret EWOD-induced flow as a result of capillary streaming.

  abstract = {Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) are the guided waves that propagate along the top surface of a material with wave vectors orthogonal to the normal direction to the surface. Based on these waves, SAW sensors are conceptualized by employing piezoelectric crystals where the guided elastodynamic waves are generated through an electromechanical coupling. Electromechanical coupling in both active and passive modes is achieved by integrating interdigitated electrode transducers (IDT) with the piezoelectric crystals. Innovative meta-designs of the periodic IDTs define the functionality and application of SAW sensors. This review article presents the physics of guided surface acoustic waves and the piezoelectric materials used for designing SAW sensors. Then, how the piezoelectric materials and cuts could alter the functionality of the sensors is explained. The article summarizes a few key configurations of the electrodes and respective guidelines for generating different guided wave patterns such that new applications can be foreseen. Finally, the article explores the applications of SAW sensors and their progress in the fields of biomedical, microfluidics, chemical, and mechanobiological applications along with their crucial roles and potential plans for improvements in the long-term future in the field of science and technology.},

It has recently been shown that surface acoustic waves (SAWs) can be piezoelectrically coupled to superconducting qubits, and confined in high-quality Fabry--Perot cavities in the quantum regime. Here we present measurements of a device in which a superconducting qubit is coupled to a SAW cavity, realising a surface acoustic version of cavity quantum electrodynamics. We use measurements of the AC Stark shift between the two systems to determine the coupling strength, which is in agreement with a theoretical model. This quantum acoustodynamics architecture may be used to develop new quantum acoustic devices in which quantum information is stored in trapped on-chip acoustic wavepackets, and manipulated in ways that are impossible with purely electromagnetic signals, due to the 10               5               times slower mechanical waves.},

  abstract = {A microfluidic colorimetric biosensor was developed using thiolated polystyrene microspheres (SH-PSs) for aggregating of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), a novel hose-based microvalve for controlling the flow direction, and a smartphone imaging APP for monitoring colorimetric signals. Aptamer-PS-cysteamine conjugates were used as detection probes and reacted with Salmonella in samples. Complementary DNA - magnetic nanoparticle (cDNA MNP) conjugates were used as capture probes, reacted with the free aptamer-PS-cysteamine conjugates. AuNPs were aggregated on the surface of Salmonella-aptamer-PS-cysteamine conjugates, resulting in a visible color change in the detection chamber, which indicating different concentrations of Salmonella. The limit of detection was low to 6.0 {\texttimes} 101 cfu/mL. The microfluidic biosensor exhibited a good specificity. It was evaluated by analyzing salad samples spiked with Salmonella. The recoveries ranged from 91.68\% to 113.76\%, which indicated its potential application in real samples.},

  abstract = {The response time for maximum drop deformation and its comparison with different time scales is established and verified with experiments. The applied fluctuation is achieved by applying a single wave perturbation of electrowetting with desired amplitude and frequency. To pinpoint the importance of the initial actuation conditions, the variance in the maximum drop deformation for a single wave perturbation is studied. The focus of this study was to analyze the maximum deformation of a drop for a wide range of actuation mechanism with a varied drop or surrounding medium viscosities. The drop response to this cyclic actuation is compared with the equivalent mass--spring--dampener system, and limitations of this approach are identified. Interestingly, the qualitative results were similar between the air and liquid medium cases, but the attainment of equilibrium configuration was dissimilar. As anticipated, the higher actuation magnitude and frequency deformed the drop significantly and thus altered the drop configuration. Higher viscosity of drops and the surrounding medium delayed the time to achieve the maximum deformation. Accurately predicting the time required for a drop to attain the maximum deformation is paramount for optimizing processes and based on microfluidics technology.},

Known mixtures of viable and heat-treated cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were separated and selectively isolated using positive and negative dielectrophoretic forces generated by microelectrodes in a small chamber. Good correlations with the initial known relative compositions were obtained by direct microscopic counting of cells at the electrodes after initial dielectrophoretic separation (r = 0.995), from methylene blue staining (r = 0.992) and by optical absorption measurements (r = 0.980) of the effluent after selectively flushing out the viable and non-viable cells from the chamber. Through measurement of cell viability by staining with methylene blue and plate counts, for an initial suspension of approx. 1.4 x 10 7 cells per ml containing 60\% non-viable cells, the dielectrophoretically separated non-viable fraction contained 3\% viable cells and the viable fraction 8\% dead cells. The separation efficiency is increased by dilution of the initial suspension or by repeat operation(s). Cell viability was not affected by the separation procedure.},

In essence, this technique relies on the correlation between the capacitance of two top-bottom electrodes with the amount of droplet overlap on the electrode. This paper describes an experimental setup used to gather capacitance data from a set of electrodes with varying droplet overlap to determine the droplet position. A prototype closed digital microfluidic (DMF) system consisting of an array of electrodes in the form of a 2 {\texttimes} 2 matrix was fabricated. A circular droplet was positioned on the DMF system, and capacitance measurements for each of the four electrodes were taken using a fast data acquisition device. A sufficiently accurate approximation of the droplet position was made using the four capacitance measurements. The paper presents the experimental results and also discusses the sources of error, viability of the experimental setup and manufacturing procedure for use in the development of capacitance measurement droplet position sensing techniques.},

  abstract = {DEP               is an established technique for particle manipulation. Although first demonstrated in the 1950s, it was not until the development of miniaturization techniques in the 1990s that               DEP               became a popular research field. The 1990s saw an explosion of               DEP               publications using microfabricated metal electrode arrays to sort a wide variety of cells. The concurrent development of microfluidics enabled devices for flow management and better understanding of the interaction between hydrodynamic and electrokinetic forces. Starting in the 2000s, alternative techniques have arisen to overcome common problems in metal-electrode               DEP               , such as electrode fouling, and to increase the throughput of the system. Insulator-based               DEP               and light-induced               DEP               are the most significant examples. Most recently, new 3               D               techniques such as carbon-electrode               DEP               , contactless               DEP               , and the use of doped               PDMS               have further simplified the fabrication process. The constant desire of the community to develop practical solutions has led to devices which are more user friendly, less expensive, and are capable of higher throughput. The state-of-the-art of fabricating               DEP               devices is critically reviewed in this work. The focus is on how different fabrication techniques can boost the development of practical               DEP               devices to be used in different settings such as clinical cell sorting and infection diagnosis, industrial food safety, and enrichment of particle populations for drug development.},

Carbon-DEP combines advantages of metal-electrode and insulator-based DEP by using low-cost fabrication techniques and low voltages for particle manipulation. The use of 3-D electrodes is proved to yield significant advantages over the use of traditional planar electrodes. This paper details the fabrication of dense arrays of tall high aspect ratio carbon electrodes on a transparent fused-silica substrate. The shrinkage of the SU-8 structures during carbonization is characterized and a design tool for future devices is provided. Applications of carbon electrodes in DEP are then detailed and include particle positioning, high-throughput filtering and cell focusing using positive-DEP. Manipulated cells include               Saccharomyces cerevisiae               and               Drosophila melanogaster               .

IDEs made of indium tin oxide (ITO) and ITO coated with iridium oxide (IrOx) were used for ECIS measurements with the human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. The results indicate that IrOx-modified ITO electrodes provide both biocompatibility and higher cell sensitivity compared to ITO electrodes. We also found that the quantity of IrOx required to generate such a sensitivity improvement is sufficiently low to not interfere with the visualization of the cells under study.

  abstract = {This article describes a method for fabricating 3D microfluidic devices by stacking layers of patterned paper and double-sided adhesive tape. Paper-based 3D microfluidic devices have capabilities in microfluidics that are difficult to achieve using conventional open-channel microsystems made from glass or polymers. In particular, 3D paper-based devices wick fluids and distribute microliter volumes of samples from single inlet points into arrays of detection zones (with numbers up to thousands). This capability makes it possible to carry out a range of new analytical protocols simply and inexpensively (all on a piece of paper) without external pumps. We demonstrate a prototype 3D device that tests 4 different samples for up to 4 different analytes and displays the results of the assays in a side-by-side configuration for easy comparison. Three-dimensional paper-based microfluidic devices are especially appropriate for use in distributed healthcare in the developing world and in environmental monitoring and water analysis.},

The current approach of integrating interdigitated transducers (IDTs) for SAW generation into microfluidic channels involves complex and laborious microfabrication steps. These steps often require full access to clean room facilities and hours to align the transducers to the precise location. This work presents an affordable and innovative method for fabricating SAW-based microfluidic devices without the need for clean room facilities and alignment. The IDTs and microfluidic channels are fabricated using the same process and thus are precisely self-aligned in accordance with the device design. With the use of the developed fabrication approach, a few types of different SAW-based microfluidic devices have been fabricated and demonstrated for particle separation and active droplet generation.},

  abstract = {The digital microfluidic (DMF) platform introduces many applications in biomedical assays. If it is to be commercially available to the public, it needs to have the essential features of smart sensing and a compact size. In this work, we report on a fractal electrode biosensor that is used for both droplet actuation and sensing C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration levels to assess cardiac disease risk. Our proposed electrode is the first two-terminal electrode design to be integrated into DMF platforms. A simulation of the electrical field distribution shows reduced peak intensities and uniform distribution of the field. When compared to a V-notch square electrode, the fractal electrode shows a superior performance in both aspects, i.e. field uniformity and intensity. These improvements are translated into a successful and responsive actuation of a water droplet with 100V. Likewise, the effective dielectric strength is improved by a 33\% increase in the fractal electrode breakdown voltage. Additionally, the capability of the fractal electrode to work as a capacitive biosensor is evaluated with CRP quantification test. Selected fractal electrodes undergo a surface treatment to immobilize anti-CRP antibodies on their surface. The measurement shows a response to the added CRP in capacitance within three minutes. When the untreated electrodes were used for quantification, there was no significant change in capacitance, and this suggested that immobilization was necessary. The electrodes configuration in the fabricated DMF platform allows the fractal electrodes to be selectively used as biosensors, which means the device could be integrated into point-of-care applications.},

  abstract = {Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is a nondestructive and noninvasive method which is favorable for point-of-care medical diagnostic tests. This technique exhibits prominent relevance in a wide range of medical applications wherein the miniaturized platform for manipulation (immobilization, separation or rotation), and detection of biological particles (cells or molecules) can be conducted. DEP can be performed using advanced planar technologies, such as complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) through interdigitated capacitive biosensors. The dielectrophoretically immobilization of micron and submicron size particles using interdigitated electrode (IDE) arrays is studied by finite element simulations. The CMOS compatible IDEs have been placed into the silicon microfluidic channel. A rigorous study of the DEP force actuation, the IDE's geometrical structure, and the fluid dynamics are crucial for enabling the complete platform for CMOS integrated microfluidics and detection of micron and submicron-sized particle ranges. The design of the IDEs is performed by robust finite element analyses to avoid time-consuming and costly fabrication processes. To analyze the preliminary microfluidic test vehicle, simulations were first performed with non-biological particles. To produce DEP force, an AC field in the range of 1 to 5 V (peak-to-peak) is applied to the IDE. The impact of the effective external and internal properties, such as actuating DEP frequency and voltage, fluid flow velocity, and IDE's geometrical parameters are investigated. The IDE based system will be used to immobilize and sense particles simultaneously while flowing through the microfluidic channel. The sensed particles will be detected using the capacitive sensing feature of the biosensor. The sensing and detecting of the particles are not in the scope of this paper and will be described in details elsewhere. However, to provide a complete overview of this system, the working principles of the sensor, the readout detection circuit, and the integration process of the silicon microfluidic channel are briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {A highly sensitive and electrochemically active sensor has been fabricated by using an ethanolamine (AE) and Ag-nanoparticle (AgNP) dual-functionalized graphene oxide (fG) architecture (Ag-AEfG). The Ag-AEfG nanocomposites can be constructed via a one-pot hydrothermal method. The AgNPs were uniformly dispersed on the AEfG surface as seen from scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The silver-nanostructure morphology can be controlled via the reaction temperature. The electrochemical properties of the Ag-AEfG-based sensor were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and amperometric techniques. The experimental results indicate that AgNPs act as a catalytic core, AE can be regarded as a reducing agent and the dispersant, AEfG, is a conductive platform. The novel sensor exhibits a high sensitivity towards nitrite. The detection limits (S/N = 3) for nitrite in phosphate buffer solutions (PBS, pH = 7.4) is 0.023 {$\mu$}M and the linear response range varies from 0.05 to 3000 {$\mu$}M. The novel sensor exhibits a high sensitivity, stability and satisfactory reproducibility. Therefore, it was used to determine the concentration of nitrite in tap water in Nanjing. This study can help us to integrate nanosilver and AEfG for use in advanced electrochemical sensors.},

Life sciences lead the way to synthesizing millions of different oligonucleotides in extremely miniaturized reaction sites, e.g., pinpointing active genes in whole genomes, while chemistry advances different types of automation. Recent progress in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) imaging could match miniaturized chemical synthesis with a powerful analytical tool to validate the outcome of many different synthesis pathways beyond applications in the life sciences. Thereby, due to the radical miniaturization of chemical synthesis, thousands of molecules can be synthesized. This in turn should allow ambitious research, e.g., finding novel synthesis routes or directly screening for photocatalysts. Herein, different technologies are discussed that might be involved in this endeavor. A special emphasis is given to the obstacles that need to be tackled when depositing tiny amounts of materials to many different extremely miniaturized reaction sites.},

The expansion of global urban areas has resulted in marked alterations to natural processes, environmental quality and natural resource consumption. The urban landscape influences infiltration and evapotranspiration, complicating our capacity to quantify their dynamics across a heterogeneous landscape at contrasting scales. Impervious surfaces exacerbate runoff processes, whereas runoff from pervious areas remains uncertain owing to variable infiltration dynamics. Increasingly, the link between the natural hydrological cycle and engineered water cycle has been made, realising the contributions from leaky infrastructure to recharge and runoff rates. Urban landscapes are host to a suite of contaminants that impact on water quality, where novel contaminants continue to pose new challenges to monitoring and treatment regimes. This review seeks to assess the major advances and remaining challenges that remain within the growing field of urban hydrology.},

Despite its ubiquity, the complexity of designing and controlling custom microfluidic devices present major barriers to adoption, requiring intuitive knowledge gained from years of experience. If these barriers were overcome, microfluidics could miniaturize biological and chemical research for non-experts through fully-automated platform development and operation. The intuition of microfluidic experts can be captured through machine learning, where complex statistical models are trained for pattern recognition and subsequently used for event prediction. Integration of machine learning with microfluidics could significantly expand its adoption and impact. Here, we present the current state of machine learning for the design and control of microfluidic devices, its possible applications, and current limitations.},

Three dimensional cell culture models, such as the multicellular spheroid, provide instead a more accurate representation. However, existing spheroid-based assessment methods are generally labour-intensive and low-throughput. Emulsion based technologies offer enhanced mechanical stability during multicellular tumour spheroid formation and culture and are scalable to enable higher-throughput assays. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of emulsion-based techniques for the formation and long term culture of multicellular UVW glioma cancer spheroids and apply these findings to assess the cytotoxic effect of radiation on spheroids. Our results showed that spheroids formed within emulsions had similar morphological and growth characteristics to those formed using traditional methods. Furthermore, we have identified the effects produced on the proliferative state of the spheroids due to the compartmentalised nature of the emulsions and applied this for mimicking tumour growth and tumour quiescence. Finally, proof of concept results are shown to demonstrate the scalability potential of the technology for developing high-throughput screening assays.},

The moving droplets by digital microfluidic module will envelope the disk of active zone, so the captured particles can change the vibration frequency of resonance.

A state space model has been derived from circuit analogy approach to describe the microfluidic network. Furthermore, a COMSOL-based study is primed for device structure by means of droplet generation and controlling the droplet through fitted valves. Moreover, an image processing algorithm based on active contours has been proposed in this research to track the movement of the droplet through the channel. This droplet controlling method is utterly based on fuzzy controller as well as camera images to move the droplet at desired position by controlling flow rates inside the fluidic channel using valves installed inside the microfluidic device. The results indicate that the fuzzy logic controller performs much better in terms of stability and faster response as compared to conventional proportional--integral--derivative controller.},

Scaling down the EWOD process has been a technological development recently as it appeared to have better integration and automation of numerous procedures on a single device. The applied voltage plays an important role in this study. A low voltage will diminish the ionization effect happening within the droplet. Insufficient ionization will further cause the inability of droplet movement. Therefore, a high voltage must be applied to initiate droplet movement. This study focuses on high voltage switching system for electrowetting process. Results achieved shown that MOSFET IRF 740 acted as the best switching component for the system. Besides, this study proves the feasibility of electrowetting by describing the fabrication and testing of different dielectric layers using high voltage switching system. As for the coating of dielectric layer, cooking oil showed the most noticeable results out of all the materials.},

The encounter of nanoparticles with cellular membranes may alter membrane structure and function, lead to uptake into cells, or elicit adverse biological responses. Supported lipid bilayers have proven to be valuable               ex vivo               models for biological membranes, allowing investigation of their mechanisms of interaction with nanoparticles with a degree of control impossible in living cells. To date, the majority of research on nanoparticle interaction with supported lipid bilayers has employed membranes composed of single or binary mixtures of phospholipids. Cellular membranes contain a wide variety of lipids and exhibit lateral organization. Ordered membrane domains enriched in specific membrane components, also referred to as lipid rafts, have not been explored with respect to their interaction with nanoparticles. Here we develop model membranes containing segregated domains differing in fluidity that are amenable to investigation by a variety of surface-sensitive analytical techniques and demonstrate that these domains influence the extent of nanoparticle attachment to model membranes. We determined conditions that allow reliable formation of bilayers containing liquid-ordered domains enriched in sphingomyelin and cholesterol and confirmed their morphology by structured illumination and atomic force microscopies. We demonstrate that the presence of liquid-ordered domains increases attachment of cationic gold nanoparticles to model membranes relative to those lacking such domains under near physiological ionic strength conditions (0.1 M NaCl) at pH 7.4. We anticipate that these results will serve as the foundation for and motivate further study of nanoparticle interaction with phase-segregated domains.},

Within the clinical laboratory industry the impetus for change has come from technological development (miniaturization, nanotechnology, and their collective effect on point-of-care testing; POCT) and the increasingly global nature of laboratory services. Potential technological gains in POCT include: the development of bio-sensors, microarrays, genetics and proteomics testing, and enhanced web connectivity. In globalization, prospective opportunities lie in: medical tourism, the migration of healthcare workers, cross-border delivery of testing, and the establishment of accredited laboratories in previously unexplored markets. Accompanying these impressive opportunities are equally imposing challenges. Difficulty transitioning from research to clinical use, poor infrastructure in developing countries, cultural differences and national barriers to global trade are only a few examples. Dealing with the issues presented by globalization and the impact of developing technology on POCT, and on the clinical laboratory services industry in general, will be a daunting task. Despite such concerns, with appropriate countermeasures it will be possible to address the challenges posed. Future laboratory success will be largely dependent on one's ability to adapt in this perpetually shifting landscape.},

The resulting devices exhibited excellent sensing properties toward anions and cations, characterized by a near-Nernstian response and over 4 orders of magnitude linear range. Impedance and chronopotentiometric measurements revealed the presence of large bulk capacitance (204 {\textpm} 2 {$\mu$}F) and good potential stability (drift of 11.1 {\textpm} 0.5 {$\mu$}A/h). Potentiometric water test and contact angle measurements showed that this class of materials exhibited hydrophobicity and inhibited the formation of water layer at the electrode/membrane interface, resulting in a highly stable sensing response with a potential drift as low as 11.1 {$\mu$}A/h. The property of ion-to-electron transduction of conductive MOFs may form the basis for the development of this class of materials as promising components within ion-selective electrodes.},

  abstract = {Integrated real-time control (RTC) of urban wastewater systems is increasingly presented as a promising and emerging strategy to deliver improved surface water quality by responsive operation according to real-time data collected from the sewer system, treatment plant, and the receiving water. However, the detailed benefits and costs associated with integrated RTC have yet to be comprehensively evaluated. Built on state-of-the-art modeling and analytical tools, a three-step framework is proposed to develop integrated RTC strategies which cost-effectively maximize environmental outcomes. Results from a case study show integrated RTC can improve river quality by over 20\% to meet the ``good status'' requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive with a 15\% reduced cost, due to responsive aeration with changing environmental assimilation capacity. The cost-effectiveness of integrated RTC strategies is further demonstrated against tightening environmental standards (to the strictest levels) and against two commonly used compliance strategies. Compared to current practices (seasonal/monthly based operation), integrated RTC strategies can reduce costs while improving resilience of the system to disturbances and reducing environmental risk.},

  abstract = {The generation of droplets is one of the most critical steps in the droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) procedure. In this study, the mechanism of droplet formation in microchannel structure and factors affecting droplet formation were studied. The physical field of laminar two-phase flow level was used to simulate the process of droplet generation through microfluidic technology. The effect of the parameters including flow rate, surface tension, and viscosity on the generated droplet size were evaluated by the simulation. After that, the microfluidic chip that has the same dimension as the simulation was then, fabricated and evaluated. The chip was made by conventional SU-8 photolithography and injection molding. The accuracy of the simulation was validated by comparing the generated droplets in the real scenario with the simulation result. The relative error (RE) between experimentally measured droplet diameter and simulation results under different flow rate, viscosity, surface tension and contact angle was found less than 3.5\%, 1.8\%, 1.4\%, and 1.2\%, respectively. Besides, the coefficient of variation (CV) of the droplet diameter was less than 1\%, which indicates the experimental droplet generation was of high stability and reliability. This study provides not only fundamental information for the design and experiment of droplet generation by microfluidic technology but also a reliable and efficient investigation method in the ddPCR field.},

Despite wide-ranging uses, this powerful research platform remains under-utilized by the atmospheric aerosol science community. This review will summarize selected microfluidic concepts and tools with potential applications to aerosol science. Where appropriate, the basic operating conditions and tunable parameters in microfluidics will be compared to typical aerosol experimental methods. Microfluidics offers a number of advantages over larger-scale experiments; for example, the small volumes of sample required for experiments open a number of avenues for sample collection that are accessible to the aerosol community. Filter extraction, spot sampling, and particle-into-liquid sampling techniques could all be used to capture aerosol samples to supply microfluidic measurements and experiments. Microfluidic concepts, such as device geometries for creating emulsions and developments in particle and droplet manipulation techniques will be reviewed, and current and potential microfluidic applications to aerosol science will be discussed.},

  abstract = {Microfluidic devices can provide innovative means to handle and control the transport of (bio)particles within a fluid flow. The advantage of microscale devices is that different components can be integrated in a single chip at low cost, with a negligible power consumption, compared to alternative solutions. In this work, a numerical investigation is developed on the use of standing surface acoustic waves (SAWs) generated within a microfluidic channel in order to manipulate microparticles. Far-field waves are generated via inter-digital transducers (IDTs), travel on the surface of a piezoelectric substrate and finally interfere in the channel, giving rise to a standing wave solution in terms of acoustic pressure. Results are reported for different geometries of the channel, to define the sensitivity of the acoustic pressure field to the relevant geometric features of the channel. This investigation shows how the acoustic radiation and drag forces interact with each other to move and focus the particles, possibly leading to a separation of heterogeneous ones, and generally provide a way to manipulate them at a small scale.},

  abstract = {The present work describes the phenomenological approach to automatically determine the frequency range for positive and negative dielectrophoresis (DEP)---an electrokinetic force that can be used for massively parallel micro- and nano-assembly. An experimental setup consists of the microfabricated chip with gold microelectrode array connected to a function generator capable of digitally controlling an AC signal of 1 V (peak-to-peak) and of various frequencies in the range between 10 kHz and 1 MHz. The suspension of latex microbeads (3-{\textmu}m diameter) is either attracted or repelled from the microelectrodes under the influence of DEP force as a function of the applied frequency. The video of the bead movement is captured via a digital camera attached to the microscope. The OpenCV software package is used to digitally analyze the images and identify the beads. Positions of the identified beads are compared for successive frames via Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm that determines the cloud behavior of the microbeads and algorithmically determines if the beads experience attraction or repulsion from the electrodes. Based on the determined behavior of the beads, algorithm will either increase or decrease the applied frequency and implement the digital command of the function generator that is controlled by the computer. Thus, the operation of the study platform is fully automated. The AI-guided platform has determined that positive DEP (pDEP) is active below 500 kHz frequency, negative DEP (nDEP) is evidenced above 1 MHz frequency and the crossover frequency is between 500 kHz and 1 MHz. These results are in line with previously published experimentally determined frequency-dependent DEP behavior of the latex microbeads. The phenomenological approach assisted by live AI-guided feedback loop described in the present study will assist the active manipulation of the system towards the desired phenomenological outcome such as, for example, collection of the particles at the electrodes, even if, due to the complexity and plurality of the interactive forces, model-based predictions are not available.},

The PCB-based SAW (PCB-SAW) device is systematically characterised and benchmarked with a SAW device made using the conventional photolithography process with the same specifications. Microparticle manipulations such as streaming in droplets and patterning in microchannels were demonstrated in the PCB-SAW device. In addition, the PCB-SAW device was applied as an acoustic tweezer to pattern lung cancer cells to form three or four traces inside the microchannel in a controllable manner. Cell viability of {$\sim$}97\% was achieved after acoustic manipulation using the PCB-SAW device, which proved its ability as a suitable tool for acoustophoretic applications.},

Qualitatively, the process is analogous to the electrowetting of aqueous electrolyte solutions: the contact angle versus voltage curve has a parabolic shape which saturates at larger voltages (positive or negative). On the other hand we observed several peculiarities: (i) the efficiency is significantly lower (by about an order of magnitude); (ii) the influence of the bulky cation is larger and the importance of the smaller anion is lesser, especially with respect to electrowetting saturation; (iii) there is an asymmetry in the saturation contact angles found for positive and negative voltages. The asymmetry may be correlated with the cationanion asymmetry of the ionic liquids. The low efficiency may be caused by the presence of water and other impurities in these commercial materials.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic (DMF) sensors integrated with circuit systems have been applied to a broad range of applications including biology, medicine, and chemistry. Compared with the conventional microfluidic devices that require extra liquid as a carrier and a complex pumping system to operate, DMF is an ideal platform for ion-selective sensing as it enables the droplet operation in a discrete, accurate, and automatic way. However, it is quite rare that DMF platform is utilized for the ion-selective detection. In this paper, we report an integrated DMF system which combines DMF and ionselective sensing for facile blending of multiple ions, and detection of targeted primary ion. The platform is fabricated through an additive manufacturing method, together with the real-time droplet's motion monitoring feedback system. Thus, the fabricated system demonstrates controlled droplet manipulation ability including droplet actuation, mixing, and speed control. Targeted primary ion is selectively detected under concentration range from 10-6 to 1 M. The interference study with blended ions has been investigated through on-chip ion selective membranes.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidics (DMF) is a promising lab-on-a-chip technology which has been applied in a wide variety of fields, including chemical sensing, biological detection, and even mechanical transportation. However, the appearance and functions of current DMF have been limited within two-dimensional planar space because of the conventional fabrication methods, such as photolithography or screen printing. In this paper, we report a DMF system which utilizes the advantage of three-dimensional (3D) printing to develop the novel form factor of electrodes and conversion of channels from planar to 3D forms. Vertical channels have been fabricated through combined 3D printing methods to facilitate stable and controlled movement of water droplets. The interfaces among liquid, gas, and solid were analyzed through Young-Lippmann law. We calculated the actuation force in a series of different configurations to enable us to optimize the system. Inspired by xylem structures in plants, the vertical movement and pumping of droplets are demonstrated by a programmable control system with a built-in boost converter for a real-time operating and portable DMF system. This work validates the promise of 3D printing to make 3D vertical DMF devices and the potential of the artificial xylem chip for micropumping applications.},

Various types of DMF devices have been demonstrated to improve their capabilities such as smaller device size for portability, higher reliability, and multi-purpose applications, etc. Among them, the electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) is one of the most widely used mechanisms to manipulate droplets due to its good flexibility. On the other hand, the high-voltage application that required for EWOD-type DMF also limits the portability and dimension of the whole system. In this review, we discuss the DMFs which are powered by alternative sources other than electrical sources and evaluate their potential for future portable biochemical assays. Then, the demonstrations reported with the possibility beyond high voltage are discussed starting from lowering voltage requirement for EWODs to the unique methods using mechanical, optical, and energy harvesting to power DMF devices. Finally, the practical applications and prospective on the integrated multi-functional lab-on-a-chip applications are tackled.},

Due to recent advancements in the biomicroelectromechanical system and its various applications to clinical, environmental, and military operations, the design complexity and the scale of a DMFB are expected to explode in the near future, thus requiring strong support from CAD as in conventional VLSI design. Among the multiple design stages of a DMFB, droplet routing, which schedules the movement of each droplet in a time-multiplexed manner, is one of the most critical design challenges due to high complexity as well as large impacts on performance. Our algorithm first routes a droplet with higher bypassibility which is less likely to block the movement of the others. When multiple droplets form a deadlock, our algorithm resolves it by backing off some droplets for concession. The final compaction step further enhances timing as well as fault tolerance by tuning each droplet movement greedily. The experimental results on hard benchmarks show that our algorithm achieves over 35{\texttimes} and 20{\texttimes} better routability with comparable timing and fault tolerance than the popular prioritized A{$\ast$} search and the state-of-the-art network-flow-based algorithm, respectively.},

  abstract = {Internal mixing within a sessile liquid drop can be significantly enhanced by means of so-called electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD), using an alternating electric potential. This is done experimentally by monitoring the coalescence and mixing of dyed liquid drops that are brought together by electrowetting actuation. The process is monitored using high-speed imaging and the extent of mixing with AC forcing after coalescence is tracked. Here, EWOD refers to manipulation of contact angle of a liquid drop on a surface by application of an electrical potential between the drop and an electrode embedded in the surface, separated from the drop by a thin dielectric layer. To understand the internal mixing, which appears to be driven by shape oscillations of the sessile drop, we also conduct fundamental studies of the shape oscillations of drops that are attached to a planar solid surface. Through image processing, we show that depending on the frequency of the applied alternating field, various modes of oscillation, including non-axisymmetric ones, may be excited.},

  abstract = {This review presents an overview of the different techniques developed over the last decade to regulate the temperature within microfluidic systems. A variety of different approaches has been adopted, from external heating sources to Joule heating, microwaves or the use of lasers to cite just a few examples. The scope of the technical solutions developed to date is impressive and encompasses for instance temperature ramp rates ranging from 0.1 to 2,000 {$^\circ$}C/s leading to homogeneous temperatures from -3 {$^\circ$}C to 120 {$^\circ$}C, and constant gradients from 6 to 40 {$^\circ$}C/mm with a fair degree of accuracy. We also examine some recent strategies developed for applications such as digital microfluidics, where integration of a heating source to generate a temperature gradient offers control of a key parameter, without necessarily requiring great accuracy. Conversely, Temperature Gradient Focusing requires high accuracy in order to control both the concentration and separation of charged species. In addition, the Polymerase Chain Reaction requires both accuracy (homogeneous temperature) and integration to carry out demanding heating cycles. The spectrum of applications requiring temperature regulation is growing rapidly with increasingly important implications for the physical, chemical and biotechnological sectors, depending on the relevant heating technique.},

Functional testing is needed to detect fluidic malfunctions. Such tests ensure whether or not, the elementary fluidic operations, such as droplet transportation, mixing, incubation, and splitting are reliably executed on the microfluidic array. Routing test and mixing/splitting test are two important steps in functional testing. We present two procedures for optimal bidirectional routing test and accelerated mixing/splitting test. Compared to previous methods, these procedures need significantly fewer droplet manipulation steps and reduced execution time. The proposed method of functional testing in an N {\texttimes} N microfluidic array requires only a constant number of mixing/splitting steps. Further, the test outcome is free from boundary errors related to droplet size that may arise during mixing/splitting test.},

  abstract = {In many biochemical protocols, sample preparation is an extremely important step for mixing multiple reagents in a given ratio. Dilution of a biochemical sample/reagent is the special case of mixing or solution preparation where only two fluids (sample and buffer) are mixed at a certain ratio corresponding to the desired concentration factor. Many bioassays often require multiple concentration values of the same sample/reagent, and implementing them efficiently on a digital microfluidic biochip is a challenge. In this paper, we present an algorithmic solution for the problem of producing a set of different target droplets in a minimum number of mix-split steps, and satisfying a given upper bound in concentration error. Unlike prior methods, this approach does not require any intermediate storage. We represent the underlying search space using a binary de Brujin graph and show that a shortest mix-split sequence can be obtained by solving an asymmetric traveling salesman problem therein. Simulation results over a large data set reveal that the proposed technique outperforms existing methods in terms of the number of mix-split steps, waste droplets, and reactant usage. The method is applicable in general scenarios of either one mixer or more mixers on the chip. A digital microfluidic platform can be easily designed to implement such a technique for rapid on-chip sample preparation.},

  abstract = {The recent continuing interest in deep eutectic solvents (DES) as ionic liquids analogues and their successful applications in different areas of separation necessities the existence of reliable physical and thermodynamic properties database. The scarcity of data on the physical properties of such solvents, increases the need for their prediction using reliable methods. In this study, first the critical temperatures of eight DES systems have been calculated based on the E{\"o}tvos empirical equation using the experimental data of the density and surface tension at various temperatures, then the density and surface tension values of these systems were predicted from the calculated critical temperatures. For the density prediction the E{\"o}tvos and Guggenheim equations were combined to introduce a simple power law equation using the estimated critical temperatures from the E{\"o}tvos and the Modified Lydersen--Joback--Reid group contribution methods. Finally, the estimated critical temperatures by these two methods were used in the Guggenheim empirical equation to calculate the surface tension of the DES systems. The prediction quality of the two physical properties under investigation were compared and proper recommendations were postulated.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidics (DMF) represents an alternative to the conventional microfluidic paradigm of transporting fluids in enclosed channels. One of the major benefits of DMF is that fluid motion and control is achieved without external pumps. The automation component of DMF have pushed the barriers of this ``lab-on-chip'' technology. However, integration with external components (i.e., ``worldto-chip'') interfaces have been a challenge. Two common ``world-to-chip'' challenges are (1) delivering biological samples to DMF devices and (2) accurately controlling temperatures on device. To address these challenges, this work describes two ``world-to-chip'' interface features that have been integrated on a DMF platform: a reagent delivery system and a thermal control apparatus. This platform enables a variety of biological or chemical experiments to be conducted on-chip while reducing manual intervention. Specifically, our platform increases reagent volumes available to device reservoirs volume by at least 50-fold eliminating the need to manually refill reservoirs while improving droplet dispensing reproducibility. In addition, we have integrated a closed-loop temperature control system that offers precise temperature control on-chip. To validate our ``world-to-chip'' interface, we have automated bacterial transformation and enzymatic assay protocols, showing that such a system enhances DMF performance. Overall, we propose that this system will improve biological experimentation which requires fluidic and temperature control integrated on DMF platforms.},

To allow single substrate type EWODs to be practically used in an automatic operation system, we developed a dimple structure as a key technique for a highly accurate droplet manipulation method. The three-dimensional shape of the dimple structure is embossed onto a disposable thin sheet. In this study, we confirmed that the dimple structure can suppress unintended droplet motion caused by unidentified factors. In addition, the stability of the droplets on the dimple structures was evaluated using a sliding experiment. On a flat substrate, the success rate of a droplet motion was lower than 70.8\%, but on the dimple structure, the droplets were able to be moved along the dimple structures correctly without unintended motion caused by several environmental conditions. These results indicated that the dimple structure increased the controllability of the droplets. Hence, the dimple structure will contribute to the practical application of digital microfluidics based on single substrate type EWODs.},

This mini review article provides a comprehensive overview of various applications of CPSs, as well as current advancements in CPS construction approaches. We begin by outlining the major technologies utilized in proximity sensing, highlighting their characteristics and applications, and discussing their advantages and disadvantages, with a heavy emphasis on capacitive sensors. Evaluating various nanocomposites for proximity sensing and corresponding detecting approaches ranging from physical to chemical detection are emphasized. The matrix and active ingredients used in such sensors, as well as the measured ranges, will also be discussed. A good understanding of CPSs is not only essential for resolving issues, but is also one of the primary forces propelling CPS technology ahead. We aim to examine the impediments and possible solutions to the development of CPSs. Furthermore, we illustrate how nanocomposite fusion may be used to improve the detection range and accuracy of a CPS while also broadening the application scenarios. Finally, the impact of conductance on sensor performance and other variables that impact the sensitivity distribution of CPSs are presented.},

This platform integrates microfluidic technology with electrical impedance sensing and embodies a unique two-chamber architecture in which the capture/reaction and detection steps are physically separated from one another. This two-chamber design is a deviation from traditional proteomic biosensors and offers the potential for greater sensitivity as the capture/reaction and detection steps can be independently optimized. We demonstrate the implementation and feasibility of this platform in assaying both protein abundance, using the human cytokine interleukin 6, and activity, using Abelson tyrosine kinase.           ,              Global studies of the human proteome have revealed a plethora of putative protein biomarkers. However, their application for early disease detection remains at a standstill without suitable methods to realize their utility in the clinical setting. There thus continues to be tremendous interest in developing new technology for sensitive protein detection that is both low in cost and carries a small footprint to be able to be used at the point of care. The current gold standard method for protein biomarker detection is the ELISA, which measures protein abundance using bulky fluorescent scanners that lack portability. Here, we present a digital microfluidic platform for protein biomarker detection that is low in cost compared with standard optical detection methods, without any compromise in sensitivity. This platform furthermore makes use of simple electronics, enabling its translation into a portable handheld device, and has been developed in a manner that can easily be adapted to assay different types of proteomic biomarkers. We demonstrate its utility in quantifying not only protein abundance, but also activity. Interleukin-6 abundance could be assayed from concentrations as low as 50 pM (an order of magnitude lower than that detectable by a comparable laboratory designed ELISA) using less than 5 {$\mu$}L of sample, and Abelson tyrosine kinase activity was detectable in samples containing 100 pM of kinase.},

In 2009, an ISO/CEN working group started with the revision of ISO 6579:2002 with two main aims: combining the three aforementioned standards in one document and improving the information in ISO 6579:2002. Additionally it was decided to split ISO 6579 into three parts, where part 1 describes the detection, part 2 the enumeration by mini-MPN (published in 2012) and part 3 the serotyping of Salmonella (published in 2014). This paper describes the experiments and choices made for improving the part on detection of Salmonella (ISO 6579-1). The final voting stage on (draft) ISO 6579-1 was finished by the end of December 2016, with a positive outcome. Finally, a real horizontal standard became available for detection of Salmonella in food, animal feed, environmental samples in the area of food production and food handling and in samples from the primary production stage in 2017.},

  abstract = {This paper reports on the use of a digital microfluidic platform to perform multiplex automated genetic engineering (MAGE) cycles on droplets containing Escherichia coli cells. Bioactivated magnetic beads were employed for cell binding, washing, and media exchange in the preparation of electrocompetent cells in the electrowetting-on-dieletric (EWoD) platform. On-cartridge electroporation was used to deliver oligonucleotides into the cells. In addition to the optimization of a magnetic bead-based benchtop protocol for generating and transforming electrocompetent E. coli cells, we report on the implementation of this protocol in a fully automated digital microfluidic platform. Bead-based media exchange and electroporation pulse conditions were optimized on benchtop for transformation frequency to provide initial parameters for microfluidic device trials. Benchtop experiments comparing electrotransformation of free and bead-bound cells are presented. Our results suggest that dielectric shielding intrinsic to bead-bound cells significantly reduces electroporation field exposure efficiency. However, high transformation frequency can be maintained in the presence of magnetic beads through the application of more intense electroporation pulses. As a proof of concept, MAGE cycles were successfully performed on a commercial EWoD cartridge using variations of the optimal magnetic bead-based preparation procedure and pulse conditions determined by the benchtop results. Transformation frequencies up to 22\% were achieved on benchtop; this frequency was matched within 1\% (21\%) by MAGE cycles on the microfluidic device. However, typical frequencies on the device remain lower, averaging 9\% with a standard deviation of 9\%. The presented results demonstrate the potential of digital microfluidics to perform complex and automated genetic engineering protocols.},

  abstract = {Micro total analytical systems (mTAS) are attractive to multiple fields that include chemistry, medicine and engineering due to their portability, low power usage, potential for automation, and low sample and reagent consumption, which in turn results in low waste generation. The development of fully-functional mTAS is an iterative process, based on the design, fabrication and testing of multiple prototype microdevices. Typically, microfabrication protocols require a week or more of highly-skilled personnel time in high-maintenance cleanroom facilities, which makes this iterative process cost-prohibitive in many locations worldwide. Rapid-prototyping tools, in conjunction with the use of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), enable rapid development of microfluidic structures at lower costs, circumventing these issues in conventional microfabrication techniques. Multiple rapid-prototyping methods to fabricate PDMSbased microfluidic devices have been demonstrated in literature since the advent of soft-lithography in 1998; each method has its unique advantages and drawbacks. Here, we present a tutorial discussing current rapid-prototyping techniques to fabricate PDMS-based microdevices, including softlithography, print-and-peel and scaffolding techniques, among other methods, specifically comparing resolution of the features, fabrication processes and associated costs for each technique. We also present thoughts and insights towards each step of the iterative microfabrication process, from design to testing, to improve the development of fully-functional PDMS-based microfluidic devices at faster rates and lower costs.},

Interdigital capacitor configuration has been implemented in various field of applications nowadays such surface acoustic wave (SAW) equipment, microwave devices, chemical and biological sensors. Such a wide area of applications has proven it to be a reliable device, which can be applied in non-invasive blood glucose monitoring system. Focus of this ongoing work is to study the analytical expression for calculating the capacitance and electric field changes of the suggested interdigital capacitor structure. This also involves the study of parameters, which affect the frequency response changes in the proposed configuration and to present a model of biological tissue. Moreover, the dependency of the capacitance on the geometrical properties of interdigital capacitor structure, electrical properties of the structure as well as those of the human biological tissue are being examined in this project. Production of a sensor based on capacitive sensing, which can be used for the non-invasive approach of blood glucose monitoring is the main target of this paper. The results include reporting changes in parameters such as relative permittivity because of blood sugar.},

Synthetic, in-vitro spheroids provide similar metabolism, proliferation, and species concentration gradients to those found in-vivo.

The first part of this paper discusses the latest microfluidic designs for spheroid formation and culture, comparing their strategies and efficacy. The most recent microfluidic techniques for spheroid formation utilize emulsion, microwells, U-shaped microstructures, or digital microfluidics. The engineering aspects underpinning spheroid formation in these microfluidic devices are therefore considered. In the second part of this paper, design considerations for microfluidic spheroid formation chips and microfluidic spheroid culture chips ( SFCs and SCCs) are evaluated with regard to key parameters affecting spheroid formation, including shear stress, spheroid diameter, culture medium delivery and flow rate. This review is intended to benefit the microfluidics community by contributing to improved design and engineering of microfluidic chips capable of forming and/or culturing three-dimensional cell spheroids.},

  abstract = {A photovoltaic system is one of the major sources of renewable energy. The grid-connected inverter controllers play an important role in the conversion and transmission of solar energy. Therefore, they must be improved to meet the demands for grid interconnection. This article introduces the design and hardware implementation of the intelligent fuzzy-PI controller of the inverter part of the grid-connected photovoltaic system. First, the paper discusses the design of the three-phase gridconnected fuzzy-PI controller. Next, the paper describes the implementation of a Matlab graphical user interface (GUI) to design any grid-connected inverter and size the photovoltaic systems. The code generation of the fuzzy-PI controller of the system is accomplished by using Matlab Simulink simulation software. The hardware components of the PV system are implemented experimentally. In the hardware implementation, a 70 W prototype is realized to test the functionality of the controller, such that one can develop a realistic controller without taking risks or falling into security concerns in the case of performing experiments on high-power systems. The prototype proves that the controller model can be directly transformed from Simulink to the control device. It also shows that the fuzzy-PI controller is working properly in the 70-watt prototype. The achieved performance parameters of the proposed fuzzy-PI controller are satisfactory. The proposed method to design and implement the fuzzy-PI controller does not require complicated programming, where a Matlab coder is proposed to transform the Simulink controller into C code that can be directly utilized as a software control program loaded in the microcontrollers embedded in the hardware of the controller. The main result is that the fuzzy-PI controller for the three-phase grid-connected systems can be implemented using low-cost reconfigurable microcontrollers.},

  abstract = {A digital electrode array, on which drops of solvent can be electronically manipulated, allows automated steroid extraction from tiny tissue samples for diagnosis or research.           ,              Extracting Estrogen from Small Samples             Microfluidic devices, in which small samples are manipulated within narrow channels, have been profitably applied to clinical sample analysis and biomedical research. These devices have advantages over more standard analysis techniques because they require only limited amounts of reagents, a boon when reagents are expensive. In addition, microfluidic devices are easy to make and can handle multiple processes and multiple samples on a single platform, enabling automation and scale-up.                            In closely related digital microfluidic (DMF) devices, the usual channels through which liquids are pumped or electrically coaxed are replaced by arrays of flat electrodes. When an electrical potential is applied to an electrode, the surface becomes locally charged, such that the droplet moves to that region. When several electrodes are charged, one by one, droplets can be made to move across the surface (and dispense and mix) in a controlled fashion. To be moveable, liquids must be slightly conductive or have dipole moment {$>$} 1; fortunately, most liquids fall into this category. This DMF technology has now been harnessed by Mousa               et al               . for extraction of the steroid estradiol from very small tissue or blood samples for ultimate quantitation.                                         Steroid hormones, which regulate essential reproductive and homeostatic functions in the human body, are routinely measured clinically in blood but not in tissue because of the large samples that would be required by current methods. Separation of steroids from other biological components is usually necessary for accurate measurements because these components often interfere with the assays. To enable measurement of estrogen in tissues or small samples of blood, Mousa               et al               . have used DMFs and built a device to extract estradiol from 1-{$\mu$}l samples.                          In their method, the biological sample is dried onto one of the electrodes and a lysing solvent is moved by application of electrical potential to the sample and dried. Then, a polar solvent moves to the sample, extracting soluble material, including steroids. The droplet containing the steroid (and other components) is then circulated within a pool of nonpolar solvent; many of the interfering compounds partition into the nonpolar liquid. The polar droplet, still containing the steroid, is moved out of the nonpolar solvent pool and dried on an electrode, ready for quantitation. For routine application, the extraction process will need to be linked to an automated measurement method.             A convenient technique for measuring estrogen in small amounts of breast tissue or tumor, for example, would allow testing whether failure to respond to therapy with selective estrogen receptor modulators such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors is a result of locally high estrogen concentrations in the tumor and whether breast cancer risk can be predicted by local estrogen concentrations. Further, androgen concentrations in the prostate could be measured to check their influences on cancer.           ,              Estrogen is a key hormone in human reproductive physiology, controlling ovulation and secondary sexual characteristics. In addition, it plays an important role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Indeed, estrogen receptor antagonists and aromatase inhibitors (which block estrogen biosynthesis) are primary drugs used for treatment and prevention in at-risk populations. Despite its importance, tissue concentrations of estrogen are not routinely measured because conventional techniques require large samples of biopsies for analysis. In response to this need, we have developed a digital microfluidic method and applied it to the extraction and quantification of estrogen in 1-microliter samples of breast tissue homogenate (as would be collected with fine-needle aspiration), as well as in whole blood and serum. This method may be broadly applicable to conditions requiring frequent analysis of hormones in clinical samples (for example, infertility and cancer).},

The prepared electrodes were also characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronopotentiometry. The experimental results showed that PEDOT(CNT) has the capability to function as solid contact in fabrication of K+-ISEs. These electrodes, based on PEDOT(CNT) as ion-to-electron transducer, showed high sensitivity and selectivity to K+ ion which can be related to the plasticized PVC-based ion-selective membrane containing valinomycin. The stability of the electrode potential, however, was found to depend on the conducting substrate used for deposition of the PEDOT(CNT) film. Results from the CV and EIS revealed that the PEDOT(CNT) contact exhibits high redox capacitance that is favorable for a solid contact.},

  abstract = {In this research, graphene oxide decorated with strontium oxide (SrO/GO) is introduced as a new adsorbent material for the efficient removal of ammonia from industrial wastewater. The new adsorbent was thoroughly studied in terms of morphology, crystallography and chemical composition using characterization techniques such as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and zeta potential analysis. Several parameters such as pH, adsorbent dosage, contact time, and ammonia initial concentration were investigated and optimized. Ammonia adsorption onto SrO/GO was validated with kinetics and adsorption isotherms by adopting different models. The results revealed that ammonia adsorption kinetic was of pseudo-second order (R2 = 0.999) implying that chemisorption behavior and the equilibrium isotherm follows Langmuir model. This behavior shows a high maximum monolayer sorption capacity of 90.1 mg g-1 at pH equal to 7 and contact time of 120 min pointing out the synergism advantageous effect. The abundant oxygen functional groups on the graphene oxide surface and the integrated Sr-O nanoparticles could efficiently interact with ammonia species creating a surface for more favorable and efficient removal of ammonia.},

The performance of an active droplet generation system is analysed based on the droplet morphology using vision sensing and digital image processing. The proposed system in the study includes a droplet generator, camera module with image pre-processing and identification algorithm, and controller and control algorithm with a workstation computer. The overall system is able to control, sense, and analyse the generation of droplets. The main controller consists of a microcontroller, motor controller, voltage regulator, and power supply. Among the morphological features of droplets, the diameter is extracted from the images to observe the system performance. The MATLAB-based image processing algorithm consists of image acquisition, image enhancement, droplet identification, feature extraction, and analysis. RGB band filtering, thresholding, and opening are used in image pre-processing. After the image enhancement, droplet identification is performed by tracing the boundary of the droplets. The average droplet diameter varied from {\textasciitilde}3.05 mm to {\textasciitilde}4.04 mm in the experiments, and the average droplet diameter decrement presented a relationship of a second-order polynomial with the droplet generation time.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting has become one of the most widely used tools for manipulating tiny amounts of liquids on surfaces. Applications range from `lab-on-a-chip' devices to adjustable lenses and new kinds of electronic displays. In the present article, we review the recent progress in this rapidly growing field including both fundamental and applied aspects. We compare the various approaches used to derive the basic electrowetting equation, which has been shown to be very reliable as long as the applied voltage is not too high. We discuss in detail the origin of the electrostatic forces that induce both contact angle reduction and the motion of entire droplets. We examine the limitations of the electrowetting equation and present a variety of recent extensions to the theory that account for distortions of the liquid surface due to local electric fields, for the finite penetration depth of electric fields into the liquid, as well as for finite conductivity effects in the presence of AC voltage. The most prominent failure of the electrowetting equation, namely the saturation of the contact angle at high voltage, is discussed in a separate section. Recent work in this direction indicates that a variety of distinct physical effects---rather than a unique one---are responsible for the saturation phenomenon, depending on experimental details. In the presence of suitable electrode patterns or topographic structures on the substrate surface, variations of the contact angle can give rise not only to continuous changes of the droplet shape, but also to discontinuous morphological transitions between distinct liquid morphologies. The dynamics of electrowetting are discussed briefly. Finally, we give an overview of recent work aimed at commercial applications, in particular in the fields of adjustable lenses, display technology, fibre optics, and biotechnology-related microfluidic devices.},

As their frequency ranges from several hundred MHz to GHz, therefore they can record remarkably diminutive frequency shifts resulting from exceptionally small mass loadings.

Owing to these special characteristics, they are widely accepted as smart transducers that can be combined with a variety of recognition layers based on host-guest interactions, metal oxide coatings, carbon nanotubes, graphene sheets, functional polymers and biological receptors. As a result of this, there is a broad spectrum of SAW sensors, i.e., having sensing applications ranging from small gas molecules to large bio-analytes or even whole cell structures. This review shall cover from the fundamentals to modern design developments in SAW devices with respect to interfacial receptor coatings for exemplary sensor applications. The related problems and their possible solutions shall also be covered, with a focus on emerging trends and future opportunities for making SAW as established sensing technology.},

This approach allows multiple millimeter-scale ICs, with micrometer-scale fluid channels built directly above the IC's surface, to be incorporated into a centimeter-sized PDMS chip.           ,                             In recent years there has been great progress harnessing the small-feature size and programmability of integrated circuits (ICs) for biological applications, by building microfluidics directly on top of ICs. However, a major hurdle to the further development of this technology is the inherent size-mismatch between ICs ({\textasciitilde}mm) and microfluidic chips ({\textasciitilde}cm). Increasing the area of the ICs to match the size of the microfluidic chip, as has often been done in previous studies, leads to a waste of valuable space on the IC and an increase in fabrication cost ({$>$}100{\texttimes}). To address this challenge, we have developed a three dimensional PDMS chip that can straddle multiple length scales of hybrid IC/microfluidic chips. This approach allows millimeter-scale ICs, with no post-processing, to be integrated into a centimeter-sized PDMS chip. To fabricate this PDMS chip we use a combination of soft-lithography and laser micromachining. Soft lithography was used to define micrometer-scale fluid channels directly on the surface of the IC, allowing fluid to be controlled with high accuracy and brought into close proximity to sensors for highly sensitive measurements. Laser micromachining was used to create {\textasciitilde}50 {$\mu$}m vias to connect these molded PDMS channels to a larger PDMS chip, which can connect multiple ICs and house fluid connections to the outside world. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we built and demonstrated an in-flow magnetic cytometer that consisted of a 5 {\texttimes} 5 cm               2               microfluidic chip that incorporated a commercial 565 {\texttimes} 1145 {$\mu$}m               2               IC with a GMR sensing circuit. We additionally demonstrated the modularity of this approach by building a chip that incorporated two of these GMR chips connected in series.},

A 3D printed module approach offers various advantages such as file sharing and the ability to easily replace, customize, and modify the individual modules. Here, we describe the use of a modular approach to electrochemically detect the ATP-mediated release of nitric oxide (NO) from endothelial cells. Nitric oxide plays a significant role in the vasodilation process; however, detection of NO is challenging due to its short half-life. To enable this analysis, we use three distinct 3D printed modules: cell culture, sample injection and detection modules. The detection module follows a pillar-based wall-jet electrode design, where the analyte impinges normal to the electrode surface, offering enhanced sensitivity for the analyte. To further enhance the sensitivity and selectivity for NO detection the working electrode (100 {$\mu$}m gold) is modified by the addition of a 27 {$\mu$}m gold pillar and platinum-black coated with Nafion. The use of the pillar electrode leads to three-dimensional structure protruding into the channel enhancing the sensitivity by 12.4 times in comparison to the flat electrode (resulting LOD for NO = 210 nM). The next module, the 3D printed sample injection module, follows a simple 4-port injection rotor design made of two separate components that when assembled can introduce a specific volume of analyte. This module not only serves as a cheaper alternative to the commercially available 4-port injection valves, but also demonstrates the ability of volume customization and reduced dead-volume issues with the use of capillary-free connections. Comparison between the 3D printed and a commercial 4-port injection valve showed similar sensitivities and reproducibility for NO analysis. Lastly, the cell culture module contains electrospun polystyrene fibers with immobilized endothelial cells, resulting in 3D scaffold for cell culture. With the incorporation of all 3 modules, we can make reproducible ATP injections (               via               the 3-D printed sample injection module) that can stimulate NO release from endothelial cells cultured on a fibrous insert in the cell culture module which can then be quantitated by the pillar WJE module (0.19 {\textpm} 0.03 nM per cell,               n               = 27, 3 inserts analyzed each day, on 9 different days). The modular approach demonstrates the facile creation of custom and modifiable fluidic components that can be assembled as needed.},

  abstract = {This work describes a flexible and portable data acquisition system that has been developed to interface to nano and ultra-micro scale electrochemical sensors at the point of use. It can perform a range of voltammetric tests, including Cyclic Voltammetry, Square Wave Voltammetry and Generator Collector Voltammetery. The data acquisition system interfaces to a smartphone, operates from a rechargeable battery and is of suitable form factor to ensure that it's fully portable. By utilising commercially available components, this system has been developed to lower the barrier for entry for the development of emerging portable electrochemical sensing technologies at micro and nano scale. To show the full range of functionality of the system, a use case involving river water quality monitoring is presented through generation of a calibration curve, using a recently developed Tyndall National Institute ultra-microband electrochemical sensor, for the detection of dissolved oxygen in river water.},

  abstract = {Rising trend of solid waste production particularly in town and city areas has caused numerous environmental pollutions. Population growth, economic and lifestyle patterns are the factors that lead to the alarming rate of solid waste production. Landfilling is widely used for disposal of wastes due to its low operation and maintenance costs. However, leachate discharged from landfill could be a problem to surface and groundwater if it is not adequately treated. So, the investigation of the transportation and transformation phenomena of micro pollutants along the river receiving discharge from landfill leachate is mandatory. This study is carried out to investigate the water quality as well as to detect the presence of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) along Kinta river in Peninsular Malaysia. Water quality parameters i.e. biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, ammoniacal nitrogen, total suspended solids, dissolved oxygen and pH were recorded to calculate the water quality index (WQI). The identification of EDCs was carried out using gas chromatography--mass spectrometry analysis. Water quality index result showed that the status of the river in both months fall under good and medium status where it requires intensive/conventional treatment for consumable and drinking purposes. None of the EDCs was detected in any of the samples analysed in the present study. It is believed that the information gained are useful and beneficial for decision making authority.},

  abstract = {The microfluidics field is at a critical crossroads. The vast majority of microfluidic devices are presently manufactured using micromolding processes that work very well for a reduced set of biocompatible materials, but the time, cost, and design constraints of micromolding hinder the commercialization of many devices. As a result, the dissemination of microfluidic technology---and its impact on society---is in jeopardy. Digital manufacturing (DM) refers to a family of computer-centered processes that integrate digital three-dimensional (3D) designs, automated (additive or subtractive) fabrication, and device testing in order to increase fabrication efficiency. Importantly, DM enables the inexpensive realization of 3D designs that are impossible or very difficult to mold. The adoption of DM by microfluidic engineers has been slow, likely due to concerns over the resolution of the printers and the biocompatibility of the resins. In this article, we review and discuss the various printer types, resolution, biocompatibility issues, DM microfluidic designs, and the bright future ahead for this promising, fertile field.},

Our present study aims to characterize and study droplet speed in a typical EWOD device. First, a practical droplet speed measurement method has been methodically demonstrated and some related velocity terms have been introduced. Next, influence of electrode shape on droplet speed has been studied and a new design to enhance droplet speed has been proposed and experimentally demonstrated. Instead of using square shaped electrodes, rectangular electrodes with smaller widths are used to actuate droplets. Additionally, different schemes of activating electrodes are studied and compared for the same applied voltage. The experiments show that a particular scheme of activating the array of rectangular electrodes enhances the droplet speed up to 100\% in comparison to the droplet speed in a conventional device with square shaped electrodes.},

Inexpensive device fabrication methods are necessary for scalable manufacturing of portable, disposable, and flexible sweat sensors. Furthermore, real-time sweat assessment must be analyzed to validate measurement reliability at various sweating rates. Here, we demonstrate a ``smart bandage'' microfluidic platform for cortisol detection and continuous glucose monitoring integrated with a synthetic skin. The low-cost, laser-cut microfluidic device is composed of an adhesive-based microchannel and solution-processed electrochemical sensors fabricated from inkjet-printed graphene and silver solutions. An antibody-derived cortisol sensor achieved a limit of detection of 10 pM and included a low-voltage electrowetting valve, validating the microfluidic sensor design under typical physiological conditions. To understand effects of perspiration rate on sensor performance, a synthetic skin was developed using soft lithography to mimic human sweat pores and sweating rates. The enzymatic glucose sensor exhibited a range of 0.2 to 1.0 mM, a limit of detection of 10 {$\mu$}M, and reproducible response curves at flow rates of 2.0 {$\mu$}L/min and higher when integrated with the synthetic skin, validating its relevance for human health monitoring. These results demonstrate the potential of using printed microfluidic sweat sensors as a low-cost, real-time, multi-diagnostic device for human health monitoring.},

  abstract = {Lab-on-a-chip (LOC) technology has gained primary attention in the past decade, where label-free biosensors and microfluidic actuation platforms are integrated to realize such LOC devices. Among the multitude of technologies that enables the successful integration of these two features, the piezoelectric acoustic wave method is best suited for handling biological samples due to biocompatibility, label-free and non-invasive properties. In this review paper, we present a study on the use of acoustic waves generated by piezoelectric materials in the area of label-free biosensors and microfluidic actuation towards the realization of LOC and POC devices. The categorization of acoustic wave technology into the bulk acoustic wave and surface acoustic wave has been considered with the inclusion of biological sample sensing and manipulation applications. This paper presents an approach with a comprehensive study on the fundamental operating principles of acoustic waves in biosensing and microfluidic actuation, acoustic wave modes suitable for sensing and actuation, piezoelectric materials used for acoustic wave generation, fabrication methods, and challenges in the use of acoustic wave modes in biosensing. Recent developments in the past decade, in various sensing potentialities of acoustic waves in a myriad of applications, including sensing of proteins, disease biomarkers, DNA, pathogenic microorganisms, acoustofluidic manipulation, and the sorting of biological samples such as cells, have been given primary focus. An insight into the future perspectives of real-time, label-free, and portable LOC devices utilizing acoustic waves is also presented. The developments in the field of thin-film piezoelectric materials, with the possibility of integrating sensing and actuation on a single platform utilizing the reversible property of smart piezoelectric materials, provide a step forward in the realization of monolithic integrated LOC and POC devices. Finally, the present paper highlights the key benefits and challenges in terms of commercialization, in the field of acoustic wave-based biosensors and actuation platforms.},

The Movement Control Order (MCO) in Malaysia acts to moderate the spread of COVID-19 through the enacted measures. Furthermore, massive industrial, agricultural activities and human encroachment were significantly reduced following the MCO guidelines. In this study, first, a reconnaissance survey was carried out on the effects of MCO on the health conditions of two urban rivers (i.e., Rivers of Klang and Penang) in Malaysia. Secondly, the effect of MCO lockdown on the water quality index (WQI) of a lake (Putrajaya Lake) in Malaysia is considered in this study. Finally, four machine learning algorithms have been investigated to predict WQI and the class in Putrajaya Lake. The main observations based on the analysis showed that noticeable enhancements of varying degrees in the WQI had occurred in the two investigated rivers. With regard to Putrajaya Lake, there is a significant increase in the WQI Class I, from 24\% in February 2020 to 94\% during the MCO month of March 2020. For WQI prediction, Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) outperformed other models in predicting the changes in the index with a high level of accuracy. For sensitivity analysis results, it is shown that NH3-N and COD play vital rule and contributing significantly to predicting the class of WQI, followed by BOD, while the remaining three parameters (i.e. pH, DO, and TSS) exhibit a low level of importance.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate a new technique of heating aqueous droplets on conventional EWOD electrodes by using highfrequency high-voltage AC signals. At high actuation frequencies (10--1000 kHz), the droplet temperature rises due to Joule heating from the ohmic currents inside the drop. Using this direct heating technique, we were able to achieve temperatures of 93--94 {$^\circ$}C, which is significant for several biochemical applications. The technique is studied extensively using experiments and modelling. Several performance parameters of this heating technique were compared with a standard microheater through experiments and simulation. For the presented technique, the substrate near the droplet was cooler in comparison to the microheater. This will reduce parasitic heating of nearby droplets. A comprehensive study regarding the optimization of the geometrical parameters and the capability to heat solutions to higher temperatures using lower voltage and higher frequency were also performed using simulations. As conventional EWOD electrodes are used for heating the liquid, separate microheaters are not required. This significantly simplifies design and allows us to heat any droplet at any location on the chip. This on demand reconfigurability of droplet heating is the primary benefit of this technique. To establish the abilities of our suggested method, two biochemical experiments were demonstrated.},

  abstract = {With the development of cross-fertilisation in various disciplines, flexible wearable sensing technologies have emerged, bringing together many disciplines, such as biomedicine, materials science, control science, and communication technology. Over the past few years, the development of multiple types of flexible wearable devices that are widely used for the detection of human physiological signals has proven that flexible wearable devices have strong biocompatibility and a great potential for further development. These include electronic skin patches, soft robots, biobatteries, and personalised medical devices. In this review, we present an updated overview of emerging flexible wearable sensor devices for biomedical applications and a comprehensive summary of the research progress and potential of flexible sensors. First, we describe the selection and fabrication of flexible materials and their excellent electrochemical properties. We evaluate the mechanisms by which these sensor devices work, and then we categorise and compare the unique advantages of a variety of sensor devices from the perspective of in vitro and in vivo sensing, as well as some exciting applications in the human body. Finally, we summarise the opportunities and challenges in the field of flexible wearable devices.},

  abstract = {In this work, a digital microfluidic system for droplet handling using ElectroWetting-On-Dielectrics (EWOD) technique in closed configuration based on Printed Circuit Board (PCB) technology is presented. The proposed system features a bidimensional 24x24-electrodes array controlled by seven control signals that allow to move a droplet along the entire array. A stack of a dielectric layer (SU-8) and a hydrophobic layer (Teflon AF1600) deposited on the PCB complete the EWOD device. Technological processes have been refined and adapted in order to be compatible with the PCB substrate material while ensuring good adhesion as well satisfactory dielectric characteristics. Experimental results of contact angle measurements as a function of the applied voltage are in good agreement with the LippmannYoung equation. The system has been tested in ``closed'' EWOD configuration by dispensing 1 {\textmu}L of water and by driving the fluid over the array applying voltages in the range 15 V to 30 V to the control electrodes.},

  abstract = {The Skudai River has experienced a general decline in water quality over the last several years due to agricultural practices, economic development, and other human activities in the river catchment. The spatial trend of water quality index (WQI) and its sub-indexes are important for determining the locations of major pollutant sources that contribute to water quality depletion in the Skudai and its tributaries. In this study, we have developed WQI for eight sections of the Skudai watershed. Ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) was identified as a major pollutant downstream from the Skudai, with the lowest WQI index (i.e. 38). WQI for the Skudai (natural) was 94, i.e., Class I (very clean) category of river water quality. The Senai River has WQI value of 85 and Class II category (slightly polluted). However, the Kempas River, which was in suburban parts of the Skudai watershed, had WQI of 53 (Class III, polluted). The Melana and Danga rivers were also polluted rivers with WQI of 69 and 57, respectively, in Class III (polluted). Overall water quality in the Skudai and its tributaries was downstream of the river. The study also assessed water quality of the Skudai and its tributaries from other water quality parameters such as conductivity, turbidity, temperature, total dissolved solids, total phosphorous, and nitrogen, which were not part of the WQI formula developed by the Department of the Environment (DOE), Malaysia. The study found that Department of Education (DOE) formula for WQI was not effective in water quality assessment as many important parameters such as nutrients, heavy metals, and fecal coliform (or E. Coli) were missing in the WQI formula.},

  abstract = {Rivers were places where civilizations arose and aided the foundations of their economic fortunes. However, most urban rivers have today been abused and undervalued, and thus little conserved or re-opened up to celebrate these waterways. Malaysia is one of a number of countries whom have witnessed the former. In 2011, the River of Life (RoL) Entry Points Projects (EPP) was introduced to address this issue aimed towards revitalizing the Klang River into a heritage riverscape and a reinvigorated linear commercial centre for Greater Kuala Lumpur and the Klang Valley (GKL/KV). This paper discusses the heritage fabric at the confluence of the Klang and Gombak Rivers in portraying and narrating the importance of these rivers to the cultural identity of this precinct. Recognising these qualities will result in highlighting the cultural heritage values that need to be considered in recognizing this riverscape as a National Heritage asset. This paper also explored the historical and potential elements of the urban river in Malaysia through the mix method approach (Convergent Parallel). Research data was obtained from Malaysian authorities, using a top-down approach, through interview and visitor participant questionnaires to obtain convergence and divergence perceptions and patterns between these two sources of data. Data obtained sought to elucidate the cultural identity of this urban riverscape and its fabric from the perspective of both official participants perceived responsibilities and the interpretation of the riverscape from local respondent perspectives. The results of data from both participant types is crucial in offering new viewpoints towards a new to better adapt the government's visions and visitor expectation about the future of this riverscape. This information could better enhance the tourism aspects of this area that has been highlighted as `National Key Economic Area (NKEA) 06: Tourism', and to foster the integration of cultural heritage in an urban setting.},

Microfluidics has emerged as a powerful way to do it in vitro cell systems, sometimes called "organ-on-chip" or "body on a chip", which mimics the in vivo environment. There are many types of microfluidics being used in different areas of research. Applications of microfluidics are in the sector of medicine as well as in industry. Microfluidics has also been used in many biological assays, in which the most important and active area is nucleic acid amplification-based LAMP (Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification).

  abstract = {Over the past-decade, agricultural products (such as vegetables and fruits) have been reported as the major vehicles for foodborne diseases, which are limiting food resources. The spread of infectious diseases due to foodborne pathogens poses a global threat to human health and the economy. The accurate and timely detection of infectious disease and of causative pathogens is crucial in the prevention and treatment of disease. Negligence in the detection of pathogenic substances can be catastrophic and lead to a pandemic. Despite the revolution in health diagnostics, much attention has been paid to the agro-food sector regarding the detection of food contaminants (such as pathogens). The conventional analytical techniques for pathogen detection are reliable and still in operation. However, laborious procedures and time-consuming detection via these approaches emphasize the need for simple, easy-to-use, and affordable detection techniques. The rapid detection of pathogens from food is essential to avoid the morbidity and mortality originating from the suboptimal nature of empiric pathogen treatment. This review critically discusses both the conventional and emerging bio-molecular approaches for pathogen detection in agro-food.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews publications that have fortified our understanding of the electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) actuation mechanism. Over the last decade, growing interest in EWOD has led to a wide range of scientific and technological investigations motivated by its applicability in microfluidics, especially for droplet-based optical and lab-on-a-chip systems. At this point in time, we believe that it is helpful to summarize the observations, insights, and modeling techniques that have led to the current picture showing how forces act on liquid droplets and how droplets respond in EWOD microfluidic devices. We discuss the basic physics of EWOD and explain the mechanical response of a droplet using free-body diagrams. It is our hope that this review will inspire new research approaches and help design useful devices.},

  abstract = {By designing and implementing a new experimental method, we have measured the dynamic advancing and receding contact angles and the resulting hysteresis of droplets under electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD). Measurements were obtained over wide ranges of applied EWOD voltages, or electrowetting numbers (0 e Ew e 0.9), and droplet sliding speeds, or capillary numbers (1.4 10 5 e Ca e 6.9 10 3). If Ew or Ca is low, dynamic contact angle hysteresis is not affected much by the EWOD voltage or the sliding speed; that is, the hysteresis increases by less than 50\% with a 2 order-of-magnitude increase in sliding speed when Ca {$<$} 10 3. If both Ew and Ca are high, however, the hysteresis increases with either the EWOD voltage or the sliding speed. Stick slip oscillations were observed at Ew {$>$} 0.4. Data are interpreted with simplified hydrodynamic (Cox Voinov) and molecular-kinetic theory (MKT) models; the Cox Voinov model captures the trend of the data, but it yields unreasonable fitting parameters. MKT fitting parameters associated with the advancing contact line are reasonable, but a lack of symmetry indicates that a more intricate model is required.},

EWOD performance is insensitive to chamber pressure because the chip is of open-channel architecture.

Protocols involving bacteria are often multistep, cumbersome and require access to a long list of instruments to perform experiments. In order to streamline these processes, the fluid handling technique digital microfluidics (DMF) has provided a miniaturized platform to perform various steps of bacterial protocols from sample preparation to analysis. DMF devices can be paired/interfaced with instrumentation such as microscopes, plate readers, and incubators, demonstrating their versatility with existing research tools. Alternatively, DMF instruments can be integrated into all-in-one packages with on-chip magnetic separation for sample preparation, heating/cooling modules to perform assay steps and cameras for absorbance and/or fluorescence measurements. This perspective outlines the beneficial features DMF offers to bacterial protocols, highlights limitations of current work and proposes future directions for this tool's expansion in the field.},

  abstract = {The rapid development resulted in the deterioration of the quality of drinking water in Malaysia. Recognizing the importance of water quality, new alternatives for drinking water such as mineral water processing from reverse osmosis (RO) machine become more popular. Hence, the demand for mineral water, natural spring water or water from the hills or mountains rose lately. More consumers believed the quality of these spring water better than other source of drinking water. However, the quality of all the drinking water sources is to meet the required quality standard. Therefore, this paper aims to measure the quality of the waters from hills, from RO machine and the water supply in Ulu Yam, Selangor Batang Kali, Malaysia. The water quality was determined based on following parameters: ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3), iron (Fe), turbidity (NTU) and pH. The results show that the water from hills has better quality compared to water supply and water from RO machine. The value of NH3 ranged from 0.03 mg/L- 0.67 mg/L; Fe was from 0.03mg/L -- 0.12 mg/L, turbidity at 0.42 NTU --0.88 NTU and pH is at 6.60 -- 0.71. Based on the studied parameters, all three types of water are fit for drinking and have met the required national drinking water quality standard.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new format for particle-based immunoassays relying on digital microfluidics (DMF) and magnetic forces to separate and resuspend antibody-coated paramagnetic particles. In DMF, fluids are electrostatically controlled as discrete droplets (picoliters to microliters) on an array of insulated electrodes. By applying appropriate sequences of potentials to these electrodes, multiple droplets can be manipulated simultaneously and various droplet operations can be achieved using the same device design. This flexibility makes DMF well-suited for applications that require complex, multistep protocols such as immunoassays. Here, we report the first particle-based immunoassay on DMF without the aid of oil carrier fluid to enable droplet movement (i.e., droplets are surrounded by air instead of oil). This new format allowed the realization of a novel on-chip particle separation and resuspension method capable of removing greater than 90\% of unbound reagents in one step. Using this technique, we developed methods for noncompetitive and competitive immunoassays, using thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and 17{$\beta$}-estradiol (E2) as model analytes, respectively. We show that, compared to conventional methods, the new DMF approach reported here reduced reagent volumes and analysis time by 100fold and 10-fold, respectively, while retaining a level of analytical performance required for clinical screening. Thus, we propose that the new technique has great potential for eventual use in a fast, low-waste, and inexpensive instrument for the quantitative analysis of proteins and small molecules in low sample volumes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whereas disease surveillance for infectious diseases such as rubella is important, it is critical to identify pregnant women at risk of passing rubella to their offspring, which can be fatal and can result in congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). The traditional centralized model for diagnosing rubella is cost-prohibitive in resource-limited settings, representing a major obstacle to the prevention of CRS. As a step toward decentralized diagnostic systems, we developed a proof-of-concept digital microfluidic (DMF) diagnostic platform that possesses the flexibility and performance of automated immunoassay platforms used in central facilities, but with a form factor the size of a shoebox. METHODS: DMF immunoassays were developed with integrated sample preparation for the detection of rubella virus (RV) IgG and IgM. The performance (sensitivity and specificity) of the assays was evaluated with serum and plasma samples from a commercial antirubella mixed-titer performance panel. RESULTS: The new platform performed the essential processing steps, including sample aliquoting for 4 parallel assays, sample dilution, and IgG blocking. Testing of performance panel samples yielded diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 100\% and 100\% for both RV IgG and RV IgM. With 1.8 L sample per assay, 4 parallel assays were performed in approximately 30 min with 10\% mean CV. CONCLUSIONS: This proof of concept establishes DMFpowered immunoassays as being potentially useful for the diagnosis of infectious disease.},

Ng               et al               . optimized inkjet-printed digital microfluidic (DMF) cartridges and a portable control system to perform serological immunoassays in remote settings. DMF devices use electrostatic forces to mix and separate reagents and samples in small droplets of fluids. The DMF system measured IgG antibodies for measles and rubella from human blood samples obtained from adults and children on-site in a refugee camp in Kenya. Four samples could be tested simultaneously, although DMF IgG detection was less sensitive and specific than laboratory-based ELISA testing of matched serum samples. The emergence of this field-compatible technology brings with it new tools for advancing global health.                        ,                             Serosurveys are useful for assessing population susceptibility to vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks. Although at-risk populations in remote areas could benefit from this type of information, they face several logistical barriers to implementation, such as lack of access to centralized laboratories, cold storage, and transport of samples. We describe a potential solution: a compact and portable, field-deployable, point-of-care system relying on digital microfluidics that can rapidly test a small volume of capillary blood for disease-specific antibodies. This system uses inexpensive, inkjet-printed digital microfluidic cartridges together with an integrated instrument to perform enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). We performed a field validation of the system's analytical performance at Kakuma refugee camp, a remote setting in northwestern Kenya, where we tested children aged 9 to 59 months and caregivers for measles and rubella immunoglobulin G (IgG). The IgG assays were determined to have sensitivities of 86\% [95\% confidence interval (CI), 79 to 91\% (measles)] and 81\% [95\% CI, 73 to 88\% (rubella)] and specificities of 80\% [95\% CI, 49 to 94\% (measles)] and 91\% [95\% CI, 76 to 97\% (rubella)] (measles,               n               = 140; rubella,               n               = 135) compared with reference tests (measles IgG and rubella IgG ELISAs from Siemens Enzygnost) conducted in a centralized laboratory. These results demonstrate a potential role for this point-of-care system in global serological surveillance, particularly in remote areas with limited access to centralized laboratories.},

  abstract = {Superhydrophobic gold film embedded PDMS was employed as a novel platform for digital magnetofluidics. The device performance for lab-on-a-chip applications was investigated by demonstrating four types of reactions. First, acid-based titration was introduced as a simple mixing reaction. Second, colorimetric detection of phosphate based on the molybdenum blue method was represented as a more complicated reaction. The fabricated device was able to determine the amount of phosphate in the concentration range of 10--100 ppm with \%RSD of color intensity of less than 5\%. Third, colorimetric detection of glucose using glucose oxidase was demonstrated as an enzymatic reaction. A linear range of 1--20 mM for determination of glucose was applied for measuring glucose in beverages with recovery percentages of glucose in the acceptable range of 89.6--106.8\%. Finally, multistep analysis of C-reactive protein (CRP) based on immunomagnetic separation was successfully demonstrated on this proposed device. Therefore, the superhydrophobic gold-coated PDMS has shown its ability to be a simple platform for digital magnetofluidics for a variety of applications in the field of lab-on-a-chip technology.},

This review describes the major proposals presented in the literature for the pretreatment, contaminant detection, and quality inspection of milk samples using microfluidic lab-on-a-chip and lab-on-paper platforms in the past five years. The review focuses on the sample separation, sample extraction, and sample preconcentration/amplification steps of the pretreatment process and the determination of aflatoxins, antibiotics, drugs, melamine, and foodborne pathogens in the detection process. Recent proposals for the general quality inspection of milk samples, including the viscosity and presence of adulteration, are also discussed.

  abstract = {Precise, automatic and reliable position control of micro-objects such as single particles, biological cells or bioorganisms is critical for applications in biotechnology and tissue engineering. However, conventional acoustofluidic techniques generally lack reliability and automation capability thus are often incapable of building an efficient and automated system where the biological cells need to be precisely manipulated in three dimensions (3D). To overcome these limitations, we developed an acoustofluidic closed-loop control system which is combined with computer vision techniques and standing surface acoustic waves (SSAWs) to implement selective, automatic and precise position control of an object, such as a single cell or microparticle in a microfluidic chamber. Position of the object is in situ extracted from living images that are captured from a video camera. By utilizing the closed-loop control strategy, the object is precisely moved to the desired location in 3D patterns or along designed trajectories by manipulating the phase angle and power signal of the SSAWs. Controlling of breast cancer cells has been conducted to verify the principle and biocompatibility of the control system. This system could be employed to build an automatic system for cell analysis, cell isolation, self-assembling of materials into complex microstructures, or lab-on-chip and organ-on-chip applications.},

In this perspective, we do not review all the current advances of Lab-on-a-chip techniques for the realisation of PoC. Instead, we aim to provide insight into what we foresee as the three most important factors to play the essential roles for succeeding in making commercially viable PoC pathogen-detection devices. The three insights are namely: the utilizations of (i) disposable polymer (microfluidic) chips, (ii) the implementation of surface-bound (or solid-phase) nucleic-acid amplification techniques and (iii) relying (more) on opensource hardware and software.},

The first part of this paper discusses the recent advances of the two main and opposing applications of liquid handling in continuous-flow microfluidics: mixing and separation. Mixing and separation are essential steps in most lab-on-a-chip platforms, as sample preparation and detection are required for a variety of biological and chemical assays. The second part discusses the various digital microfluidic strategies, based on droplets and liquid marbles, for the manipulation of discrete microdroplets. More advanced digital microfluidic devices combining electrowetting with other techniques are also introduced. The applications of the emerging field of liquid-marble-based digital microfluidics are also highlighted. Finally, future perspectives on microfluidic liquid handling are discussed.},

  abstract = {This paper reports the results of theoretical and experimental investigations of reciprocating thermocapillary motion of a liquid plug in microchannels. A one-dimensional analytical model for the transport of micro plugs in a capillary was established. The model consists of a system of two transient one-dimensional equations: one for temperature spreading in the capillary wall and one for the dynamics of surface tension driven movement of the plug. Surface tension depends strongly on temperature. Thus, a transient temperature distribution leads to a gradient of surface stress across a liquid plug. This surface stress difference leads to the movement of the liquid plug. For the experimental investigation two heaters were used for the periodic temperature gradient. Each of the heaters was activated alternatively to induce the reciprocating motion of the liquid plug. For quantitative evaluation, the position of the plugs was captured and evaluated with a CCD camera. This paper focuses on analysing the results of this motion at different switching frequencies. The results show that the motion of the plug exhibits a chaotic characteristics at high switching frequencies. This actuation concept has potential applications in post-processing stages for droplet-based microfluidics. The chaotic motion can be explored for efficient mixing in microplugs.},

This paper will present our recent achievements in thermal control of droplet formation in different configurations such as T-junction and cross junction with integrated microheaters. Furthermore, results on droplet switching will be presented. The droplet switch represent basic logic gate that can be used to construct a more complex droplet-based digital network.

  abstract = {Electrowetting technique is an actuation method for manipulating position and velocity of fluids in the microchannels. By combining electrowetting technique and a freestanding mode triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), we have designed a self-powered micro-fluidic transport system. In this system, a mini vehicle is fabricated by using four droplets to carry a pallet (6 mm {\texttimes} 8 mm) and it can transport some tiny object on the track electrodes under the drive of TENG. The motion of TENG can provide both driving power and control signal for the mini vehicle. The maximum load for this mini vehicle is 500 mg and its highest controllable velocity can reach 1 m/s. Freestanding TENG has shown excellent capability to manipulate microfluid. Under the drive of TENG, the minimum volume of the droplet can reach 70{\textasciitilde}80 nL, while the tiny droplet can freely move on both horizontal and vertical planes. Finally, another strategy for delivering nanoparticles to the designated position has also been demonstrated. This proposed self-powered transport technique may have great applications in the field of micro solid/liquid manipulator, drug delivery system, micro robotics and human-machine interaction.},

Considering the design principles investigated two novel designs were proposed; L-junction electrode design to offer high throughput droplet generation and Y-junction electrode design to split a droplet very fast while maintaining equal volume of each part. Devices of novel designs were fabricated and tested, and the results are compared with those of conventional approach. It is demonstrated that inaccuracy and inconsistency of droplet volume dispensed in the device with novel electrode designs are as low as 0.17 and 0.10\%, respectively, while those of conventional approach are 25 and 0.76\%, respectively.

These capabilities are sought in applications that need tiny but accurate volume of liquid delivery at high flow rate. For this purpose, we mainly focused on geometry of electrodes and developed novel shapes and arrangements of electrodes in electrowetting on dielectric microfluidic device. To dispense liquid droplets in higher volume precision and consistency, a novel reservoir design named TCC reservoir is introduced. To reduce time to dispense a droplet, L-junction is developed. Y-junction is designed to split a droplet into two at the same speed as droplet dispensing speed by the L-junction, and hence increase the number of droplets arrive to the target area (i.e. at high frequency delivery).},

  abstract = {Microfluidic-driven mechanical actuation opens new possibilities for positioning and manipulating delicate small components. However, existing microfluidic actuation methods are not well-suited to positioning with high resolution. This paper reports a method for precise, open-loop control of droplet position in finite steps by varying the duty cycle of the input signal in electrowetting actuation. When wetted to a solid object, both the droplet and the solid can be actuated. Unlike conventional electrowetting actuation methods, positioning resolution in our proposed method can be much smaller than the size of the underlying electrodes without requiring closed loop feedback control system. Using a leaky dielectric coating, the electrode/electrolyte combination in our device acts as a simple diode by blocking current in one direction and conducting in the other. Each duty cycle of the applied AC square wave corresponds to a unique position on the electrode. The position -- duty cycle relationship is found to be nonlinear but symmetric about the center of the electrodes. This approach provides a method for improving open-loop positioning resolution without adding more electrodes. Positioning is within 0.2 mm ({$<$}2.5\% of the droplet diameter) of the idealized model and repeatability is {$<$}0.07 mm ({$<$}0.8\% of the droplet diameter).},

The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of the microfluidic paper-based device ({\textmu}PAD) for the quantification of ammonia in wastewater. The {\textmu}PAD fabricated had an oval-shaped pattern which was designed using CorelDraw software. The hydrophilic zones were created by printing a chromatographic paper with a Xerox wax printer (Xerox colorqube 8570). The modified version of the colorimetric method using Nessler reagent was combined with microfluidic technologies to create a low-cost monitoring system for detection of ammonia in wastewater. The method allows for ammonia determination in the range of 0--5 ppm (mg/L) with a limit of detection of 3.34 ppm. This study indicated that a {\textmu}PAD was successfully used to quantify the concentration of ammonia in wastewater.},

  abstract = {A study on the Water Quality Index (WQI) has been conducted among 11 rivers in Penang Island, Malaysia from October 2012 to January 2013. The water quality status of rivers was classified based on the Interim National Water Quality Standard (INWQS) for Malaysia. The six water quality parameters used to determine the water quality index are dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solid (TSS), ammonia and pH value. Based on the WQI assessment, among the 11 rivers studied, none of the rivers were considered as clean. The upstream and middle stream of the Pinang River in Balik Pulau (with WQI = 69 and 70 respectively), the upstream and middle stream of the Kongsi River (with WQI = 67 and 72 respectively) and the upstream of the Betong River (with WQI = 63) were slightly polluted, while the rest of the rivers had a WQI of below 60, which were categorized as polluted rivers. Among the 30 sampling stations, 17 stations were classified as Class III (extensive treatment of water supply required; fish for common economic value, species tolerance, and for livestock drinking), and 13 stations were classified as Class IV water status, which was classified as irrigation according to INWQS. From this study, the WQI and river classification system were considered as a tool for assessing the health status of river water quality. Efficient and sustainable management of rivers in Penang Island should be emphasized in order to protect their aesthetic value for future generations.},

By implementing a two-dimensional (2D) acoustophoresis particle-positioning method, we show a fourfold improvement in both vertical and lateral particle positioning inside the droplets compared to unactuated operation. The efficiency of the system has been optimized by incorporating aluminum matching layers in the transducer design permitting biocompatible operational temperatures ({$<$}37 {$^\circ$}C). Furthermore, by using acoustic actuation, (99.8 {\textpm} 0.4)\% of all encapsulated microparticles can be detected compared to only (79.0 {\textpm} 5.1)\% for unactuated operation. In our experiments we observed a strong ordering of the microparticles in distinct patterns within the droplet when using 2D acoustophoresis; to explain the origin of these patterns we simulated numerically the fluid flow inside the droplets and compared with the experimental findings.},

  abstract = {Water quality monitoring has become crucial due to the increasing exposure of water bodies to pollutants from the growing global population and industrialization. Detection strategies such as electrochemical and optical analysis techniques have gained popularity in environmental monitoring owing to their sensitivity, selectivity, rapidity, low cost, and easy operation that are not obtainable in the conventional methods. However, most sensors derived from these techniques are confined to laboratory significance and need experts for signals and results analysis. In recent times, many researchers have proposed the exploitation of the robustness of these optical and electrochemical techniques for point-of-care applications in water quality monitoring. In this review, different species of water contaminants, such as biological, physical, and chemical components, were quantified and successfully detected using POCs based on these techniques. The POCs sensors demonstrated high sensitivity, reliability, and relevance at the point of need. However, the designs and implementation of these portable POC systems to support high sensitivity, selectivity, low cost, less analysis time, and robustness when deployed in complex matrices remain a challenge. Comprehending and overcoming these setbacks and limitations demand more investigations and research resources, which could delay, at the least, the development, implementation, and commercialization of POCs, even when the need is very pressing and application and merits well lauded.},

Energy problems, such as energy scarcity and energy consumption in wireless sensor networks, are critical issues that raise concerns when it comes to defining the lifetime of a network. This can be attributed to the finite energy budget of water quality sensor nodes and also the lack of energy-efficient schemes. To address these energy problems, a detailed study has been carried out in this paper on some of the major approaches developed to address energy issues in wireless sensor systems, and dedicated to the monitoring of water quality applications in a way that contextualizes the considered solution methods. Furthermore, the solution methods are classified, while their strengths and weaknesses are also identified. Also, several suggestions are made on solution methods towards further improvement. Therefore, this study suggests a reasonable direction for future studies on developing energy-efficient solutions in wireless sensor systems for monitoring water quality applications.},

  abstract = {With the transition of fluid-capillary-based ``Lab on a chip 1.0{${''}$} concepts in analytical chemistry to ``Lab on a chip 2.0{${''}$} approaches relying on distinct fluid droplets (``digital microfluidics'', DMF), the need for reliable methods for droplet actuation has increasingly come into focus. One possible approach is based on ``electrowetting on dielectric'' (EWOD). This technique has the disadvantage that any possible desired later positions of the droplets on the chip have to be defined prior to chip realization because one of the EWOD electrode layers has to be structured accordingly. ``Optoelectrowetting'' (OEW) goes a step further in the sense that the later droplet positions do not have to be known before, and none of the electrode layers has to be structured. Instead, the electrical parameters of the layer sequence can be altered locally by an impinging (and movable) light spot. Although some research groups have succeeded in demonstrating OEW actuation of droplets, the optimization of the relevant parameters of the layer sequence and the droplet -- at least half a dozen parameters altogether -- is tedious and not straight-forward. In this contribution, for optimization purposes, the equations governing OEW are revisited and altered again, e.g., by numerical implementation of the experimentally well-known saturation of the contact angle change. Additionally, a Nelder-Mead algorithm is applied to find the parameters, on which the optimization has to focus to maximize contact angle changes and, thus, mechanical forces on the droplets. The numerical investigation yields diverse results, e.g., the finding that the droplet's contact area on the dielectric layer has a strong influence on the contact angle change and the question whether the droplet is pulled or pushed. Moreover, the interplay between frequency and amplitude of the applied rectangular alternate voltage is important for optimization.},

MSC products are heterogeneous and we therefore investigated whether acoustophoresis, an ultrasound-based separation technology, could be used for the label-free enrichment of functionally different MSC populations. Acoustophoresis uses an ultrasonic standing wave field in a microchannel that differentially affects the movement of cells depending on their acoustophysical properties, such as size, density, and compressibility. Human bone marrow (BM) MSCs were generated by standard adherent culture in xeno-free medium and separated by microchip acoustophoresis. MSCs with up to 20\% higher proliferation and 1.7-fold increased clonogenic potential were enriched in the side outlet of the chip compared to the input sample. These cells were significantly smaller (average diameter 14.5\,{\textpm}\,0.4~{$\mu$}m) compared to the center outlet fraction (average diameter 17.1\,{\textpm}\,0.6~{$\mu$}m) and expressed higher levels of genes related to proliferation and stem cell properties (               i.e               .,               Ki-67               [1.9-fold],               Nanog1               [6.65-fold],               Oct4               [2.9-fold], and               CXCL12               [1.8-fold],               n               ~=~3) in the side outlet compared to input. Fractions of MSCs in G               0               /G               1               cell cycle phase were significantly enriched in the side fraction and an up to 2.8-fold increase of cells in S/G               2               /M phases were observed in center fractions compared to side fractions and 1.3-fold increased compared to the input sample. Acoustophoresis did not compromise MSC phenotype, proliferation, clonogenic capacity, and viability (generally 87--98\%), nor did it affect differentiation or immunomodulatory capacities. These results demonstrate that label-free acoustic separation can enrich functionally different MSC subsets which can potentially be employed to produce better-defined stromal cell products from cultured MSCs. Hence, acoustophoresis is a potentially promising separation technology to provide improved cell products for research and possible future clinical use. {\copyright} 2020 The Authors.

This perspective covers solutions to embed sustainability at the R\&D and product development stages.           ,                             Single-use, disposable, point-of-care diagnostic devices carry great promise for global health, including meeting urgent needs for testing and diagnosis in places with limited laboratory facilities. Unfortunately, the production and disposal of single-use devices, whether in lateral flow assay, cartridges, cassettes, or lab-on-chip microfluidic format, also poses significant challenges for environmental and human health. Point-of-care devices are commonly manufactured from unsustainable polymeric materials derived from fossil sources. Their disposal often necessitates incineration to reduce infection risk, thereby creating additional release of CO               2               . Many devices also contain toxic chemicals, such as cyanide derivatives, that are damaging to environmental and human health if not disposed of safely. Yet, in the absence of government regulatory frameworks, safe and sustainable waste management for these novel medical devices is often left unaddressed. There is an urgent need to find novel solutions to avert environmental and human harm from these devices, especially in low- and middle-income countries where waste management infrastructure is often weak and where the use of point-of-care tests is projected to rise in coming years. We review here common materials used in the manufacture of single-use point-of-care diagnostic tests, examine the risks they pose to environmental and human health, and investigate replacement materials that can potentially reduce the impact of microfluidic devices on the production of harmful waste. We propose solutions available to point-of-care test developers to start embedding sustainability at an early stage in their design, and to reduce their non-renewable plastic consumption in research and product development.},

In addition, influence of a test sample over the designed sensor for varying lift-off distances from the top of the sensor surface and for various material permittivity values are investigated. Results of the studies show that a spiral structure has about 25\% higher sensitivity for its capacitance value compared to a corresponding Rectangular Inter-Digital Capacitive (RIDC) structure of comparable dimensions. The simulation results have been verified experimentally by fabricating and testing SIDC and RIDC structures for dielectric characterization of materials and proximity measurement applications.

Various voltammetric, amperometric, and potentiometric techniques have been used for investigating the electrochemical properties of the electrode surfaces. Electrodes modified with different nanomaterials, antibodies, enzymes, aptamers, etc. have been used to improve performance. This review focuses on recent publications that provide insight into the development of sensor arrays based on microfluidic and paper-based devices. We also discuss incorporation of these devices with portable potentiostats and wireless data acquisition technology for simultaneous analysis of multiple targets.},

  abstract = {With its ability to easily infect each step of food production chain, Salmonella spp. stands as one of the most important foodborne pathogens which impose threats against economy and human health by creating high morbidity and mortality, worldwide. Although sensitive screening and detection methodologies based on common conventional techniques have been developed for Salmonella spp., their long turnaround time and strict legislative demands directs the researchers to develop more sensitive and rapid methods. Digital PCR has many potential advantages over its closest competitor, Real-Time PCR. It gives more accurate, sensitive, and precise results, especially for samples that contain low pathogen concentrations and shows more resistance against PCR inhibitors. In this study, we developed a droplet digital PCR screening methodology with a short pre-enrichment step. For this purpose, 25 g raw minced meat was subjected to Salmonella contamination, and following a very short 3 h enrichment step, bacterial isolation from 5 mL of sample was achieved. For the specific detection of the Salmonella spp., bipA gene region was selected as a better candidate. Subsequently, droplet digital PCR setup was performed and detection sensitivity of the test was determined as 1.39 cfu/mL. Furthermore, parallel experiments were also conducted using Real-Time PCR, for comparative and validative purposes. Conclusively, data gathered in this study have shown that droplet digital PCR with our proposed setup can sensitively detect Salmonella spp. in raw minced meat samples while generating the same-day results.},

  abstract = {Salmonellosis is the second most commonly reported foodborne gastrointestinal infection in humans in the European Union (EU). Most outbreaks are caused by Salmonella Enteritidis, present in contaminated food products, particularly in egg and egg products. In recent years, an increase in the prevalence of Salmonella in laying hen flocks in the EU has been observed. For the effective control of infection, adequate detection is key. In laying hen flocks, the occurrence of Salmonella in the EU is monitored by the culture of environmental samples (dust, faeces, and boot swabs). The performance of sampling procedures described in the literature for the detection of Salmonella in laying hens was reviewed. In total, 924 abstracts were screened, resulting in the selection of 87 abstracts and 18 publications for qualitative and quantitative analyses, respectively. Sample sizes and sampling locations of faecal material and dust were variable and poorly described. Microbiological culture methods used to detect Salmonella were variably described in the literature and were often incomplete. Overall, the available literature indicates higher sensitivity of environmental versus individual hen matrices and points to differences in sensitivity between environmental matrices. For non-cage housing systems, boot swabs are the preferred samples, while for cage housing systems dust might be a more reliable sample.},

The leaching processes, which affect the ISE responses, are rarely characterized by independent methods. For this purpose, differential pulse cathodic stripping voltammetry (DP CSV) is used. This method, owing to its high sensitivity, acceptable recovery and accuracy, is a good tool to characterize the kinetics of leakage of the lipophilic salts. Sodium tetraphenylborate (NaTPB) leakage from the PVC-based sodium-selective membrane containing two different plasticizers, o-nitrophenyl octyl ether (o-NPOE) or di(2-ethylhexyl) sebacate (DOS) is presented. Correlation between the rate of leaching of the lipophilic salt and dielectric constants of the plasticizers is observed. The data obtained by DP CSV correlate well with potentiometric and electrochemical impedance responses. The observed outflow of TPB- is associated with decreasing potentiometric sensitivity to sodium and increasing bulk membrane resistance.},

Effective management of water resources requires a reliable and continuous monitoring of water quality to identify contamination and the source of pollution. Traditional analysis techniques based on laboratory instrumentation are insufficient to fulfil existing monitoring requirements. By utilizing miniaturised biosensors in water quality monitoring, real-time analysis which avoids sample degradation can be achieved on-site. This article reviews common used materials and fabrication techniques for lab-ona-chip (LOC) system with sample-in--answer-out capability. Such systems will bring advantages such as low cost, high throughput and device portability to on-site determinations. The development of biosensor-based LOC systems is dependent on two essential elements: substrate material and fabrication techniques.},

Using this procedure, from voltammograms taken with varied scan-rates or other-than-triangular waveforms two scan-rate independent, hysteresis-free functions can be calculated. One of them is the diffusion-free polarization curve; the other the semiintegrated form of the reversible voltammograms. Here we show the underlying theory in details, along with numerical simulations to highlight important properties of the transformation. The theory opens a new route for the determination of chargetransfer rate coefficients of quasi-reversible redox systems.},

Their applications in sensing and therapeutics require easy synthesis with precise control over their dimensions. Here, we report a method for the synthesis of highly pure and monodisperse Au NRs with fine-tuneable dimensions and longitudinal localised surface plasmon resonance by addition of Hofmeister salts into the growth medium. The control of Au NR formation relies on the double interaction between salt--gold and salt--surfactant (cetyl trimethylammonium bromide, CTAB). With the addition of Hofmeister salts (               i.e.               NaNO               3               , NaBr, NaCl and NaHSO               4               ) we can fine-tune the aspect ratio of Au NRs in the range of 3.3 to 4.8 with a precision of 0.1 and the longitudinal absorption band from 777 to 960 nm. In addition, we have studied the physical changes in the CTAB micelles induced by the salts using rheology, electron microscopy and light-scattering techniques. We report for the first time cryo-electron microscopy imaging of the micelles under Au NR growth conditions. With the comprehensive characterization of CTAB micelles in the growth solution, this study provides a deeper understanding of the anisotropic growth of metallic crystals.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel hybrid microfluidic electronic sensing platform, featuring an electronic sensor incorporated with a microfluidic structure for life science applications. This sensor with a large sensing area of 0.7 mm2 is implemented through a foundry process called Open-Gate Junction FET (OG-JFET). The proposed OG-JFET sensor with a back gate enables the charge by directly introducing the biological and chemical samples on the top of the device. This paper puts forward the design and implementation of a PDMS microfluidic structure integrated with an OG-JFET chip to direct the samples toward the sensing site. At the same time, the sensor's gain is controlled with a back gate electrical voltage. Herein, we demonstrate and discuss the functionality and applicability of the proposed sensing platform using a chemical solution with different pH values. Additionally, we introduce a mathematical model to describe the charge sensitivity of the OG-JFET sensor. Based on the results, the maximum value of transconductance gain of the sensor is {\textasciitilde}1 mA/V at Vgs = 0, which is decreased to {\textasciitilde}0.42 mA/V at Vgs = 1, all in Vds = 5. Furthermore, the variation of the back-gate voltage from 1.0 V to 0.0 V increases the sensitivity from {\textasciitilde}40 mV/pH to {\textasciitilde}55 mV/pH. As per the experimental and simulation results and discussions in this paper, the proposed hybrid microfluidic OG-JFET sensor is a reliable and high-precision measurement platform for various life science and industrial applications.},

The analysis is performed on a two dimensional microarray. Significant researches are going on for high performance droplet routing in DMFB using computer aided design (CAD) techniques. This paper proposes a bio inspired multi objective optimization technique for multiple droplet routing in single source-single destination net (two pin net) and also for dual source - single destination net (three pin net). Our proposed method is based on ant colony optimization (ACO) technique that optimizes the number of electrode usage and routing completion time simultaneously. We run our algorithm on in-vitro, and some other existing benchmarks, and experimental results show improvement in most of the cases.},

  abstract = {A droplet of an ionic liquid (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, bmim.BF4) is immersed in an immiscible liquid (n-hexadecane) and electrowetted on a flat Teflon AF1600-coated ITO electrode. The static contact angle decreases significantly when voltage is applied between the droplet and the electrode: from 145{$^\circ$} down to 50{$^\circ$} (with DC voltage) and 15{$^\circ$} (with AC voltage). The electrowetting curves (contact angle versus voltage) are similar to the ones obtained in other solid/liquid/vapor and solid/liquid/ liquid systems: symmetric with respect to zero voltage and correctly described by Young-Lippmann equation below saturation. The reversibility is excellent and contact angle hysteresis is minimal ({$\sim$}2{$^\circ$}). The step size used in applying the DC voltage and the polarity of the voltage are unimportant. The saturation contact angle cannot be predicted with the simple zero-interfacial tension theory. Spreading (after applying a DC voltage) and retraction (after switching off the voltage) of the droplet is monitored. The base area of the droplet varies exponentially during wetting (exponential saturation) and dewetting (exponential decay). The characteristic time is 20 ms for spreading and 35 ms for retraction (such asymmetry is not observed with water-glycerol mixtures of a similar viscosity). The spreading kinetics (dynamic contact angle versus contact line speed) can be described by the hydrodynamic model (Voinov's equation) for small contact angles and by the molecular-kinetic model (Blake's equation) for large contact angles. The role of viscous and molecular dissipation follows the scheme outlined by Brochard-Wyart and de Gennes.},

These chips are also known as digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs). In this work, initially we have presented a study on the effect of external actuation voltage in various parameters like transport velocity and contact angles during droplet movement on DMFB, in the realm of surface hysteresis. Next, a greedy heuristic method is adopted in conjunction with droplet velocity lookup under varying range of voltage actuation to perform improved droplet routing on digital microfluidic biochips. Here a specified routing time, termed as latest arrival time (LAT) is calculated in an ideal case, without considering practical electrowetting effects. Then a stepwise voltage increment is performed through the droplet routing paths to reach the specified target location in time. Goal of the proposed method is to achieve a specified routing time for all the droplets towards their destinations. Experimental analysis ascertains the suitability of this technique in enhancing the throughput of an LOC in terms of transport time reduction, and elimination of any failed net during routing.},

Electrowetting is the change in contact angle of a liquid relative to its equilibrium value upon application of a potential bias. The phenomenon, being identified almost a century ago, is fundamentally an electrochemical process. However, the majority of the most recent research in this area focuses on electrowetting from the ``applications'' perspective. Device-based electrowetting uses substrates with insulating overlayers to eliminate charge transfer at the solid{\textbar}liquid interface and hence suppress the electrochemical character of the overall process. In this short review, we focus on electrowetting directly on conductors and discuss the purely electrochemical aspects of the phenomenon along with the open questions related to this rejuvenated topic.},

  abstract = {Wetting of carbon surfaces is one of the most widespread, yet poorly understood, physical phenomena. Control over wetting properties underpins the operation of aqueous energystorage devices and carbon-based filtration systems. Electrowetting, the variation in the contact angle with an applied potential, is the most straightforward way of introducing control over wetting. Here, we study electrowetting directly on graphitic surfaces with the use of aqueous electrolytes to show that reversible control of wetting can be achieved and quantitatively understood using models of the interfacial capacitance. We manifest that the use of highly concentrated aqueous electrolytes induces a fully symmetric and reversible wetting behavior without degradation of the substrate within the unprecedented potential window of 2.8 V. We demonstrate where the classical ``Young-Lippmann'' models apply, and break down, and discuss reasons for the latter, establishing relations among the applied bias, the electrolyte concentration, and the resultant contact angle. The approach is extended to electrowetting at the liquid{\textbar}liquid interface, where a concentrated aqueous electrolyte drives reversibly the electrowetting response of an insulating organic phase with a significantly decreased potential threshold. In summary, this study highlights the beneficial effect of highly concentrated aqueous electrolytes on the electrowettability of carbon surfaces, being directly related to the performance of carbon-based aqueous energy-storage systems and electronic and microfluidic devices.},

Despite their potential in diagnostics, drug development, and environmental monitoring, the widespread adoption of LoC systems has been hindered by challenges in scalability, integration, and cost-effective mass production. Traditional substrates like silicon, glass, and polymers struggle to meet the multifunctional requirements of practical applications. Lab-onPrinted Circuit Board (Lab-on-PCB) technology has emerged as a transformative solution, leveraging the costefficiency, scalability, and precision of PCB fabrication techniques. This platform facilitates the seamless integration of microfluidics, sensors, and actuators within a single device, enabling complex, multifunctional systems suitable for realworld deployment. Recent advancements have demonstrated Lab-on-PCB's versatility across biomedical applications, such as point-of-care diagnostics, electrochemical biosensing, and molecular detection, as well as drug development and environmental monitoring. This review examines the evolution of Lab-on-PCB technology over the past eight years, focusing on its applications and impact within the research community. By analyzing recent progress in PCBbased microfluidics and biosensing, this work highlights how Lab-on-PCB systems address key technical barriers, paving the way for scalable and practical lab-on-chip solutions.

We portray a vision of a fully reconfigurable microfluidic device, which can change its shape and function dynamically, thus allowing researchers to `put their hands' into a microscale experiment and enabling real-time decision making.

The conventional laboratory-based diagnostics of microbes such as bacteria and viruses need bulky expensive experimental instruments and skilled personnel which limits their usage in resource-limited settings. The biosensors-based point-of-care (POC) diagnostics have shown huge potential to detect microbial pathogens in a faster, cost-effective, and user-friendly manner. The use of various transducers such as electrochemical and optical along with microfluidic integrated biosensors further enhances the sensitivity and selectivity of detection. Additionally, microfluidic-based biosensors offer the advantages of multiplexed detection of analyte and the ability to deal with nanoliters volume of fluid in an integrated portable platform. In the present review, we discussed the design and fabrication of POCT devices for the detection of microbial pathogens which include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. The electrochemical techniques and current advances in this field in terms of integrated electrochemical platforms that include mainly microfluidic- based approaches and smartphone and Internet-of-things (IoT) and Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoMT) integrated systems have been highlighted. Further, the availability of commercial biosensors for the detection of microbial pathogens will be briefed. In the end, the challenges while fabrication of POC biosensors and expected future advances in the field of biosensing have been discussed. The integrated biosensor-based platforms with the IoT/IoMT usually collect the data to track the community spread of infectious diseases which would be beneficial in terms of better preparedness for current and futuristic pandemics and is expected to prevent social and economic losses.},

  abstract = {In a droplet transport based on electrowetting on dielectrics, the parallel-plate configuration is more popular than the single-plate one because the droplet transport becomes increasingly difficult without cover plate. In spite of the improved transport performance, the parallel-plate configuration often limits the access to the peripheral components, requesting the removal of the cover plate, the single-plate configuration. We investigated the fundamental features of droplet transport for the single-plate configuration. We compared the performance of several switching methods with respect to maximum speed of successive transport without failure and suggested nonfloating switching method which is inherently free from the charge-residue problem and exerts greater force on a droplet than conventional switching methods. A simple theory is provided to understand the different results for the switching methods.},

  abstract = {As food poisoning has increased interest in public hygiene, the study for a novel monitoring system for pathogen evaluation has been significantly explored. In this study, we established a simple single-chip pathogen analysis system by integrating the film-based PCR module, electrode module and the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based finger-actuated microfluidic modules. The film-based PCR module and electrode module were employed for gene amplification and electrochemical analysis, and the PDMS-based finger-actuated microfluidic modules were utilized for sample migration and mixing, which can replace external pumping systems. The integrated pumpless microfluidic chip contains the three parallel microfluidic channels for the simultaneous analysis of pathogens from multiple samples that channels are operated simultaneously by pressing the button without external pumping systems. Using the integrated pumpless microfluidic chip, the target gene of foodborne pathogens was amplified by a thermal cycling polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method in the film chamber, and the amplified gene was electrochemically quantified by using the square wave voltammetry. Escherichia coli O157:H7 was selected as a target pathogen and the pathogen was sensitively evaluated with the limit of detection (LOD) of 102 colony-forming units (CFU). In regard to the significant featuring of the integrated microfluidic chip, the sensing platform developed could be used for pathogen screening as a promising tool in the field of point-of-care testing.},

In spite of recent advancement in microfluidic based POC devices, there are still rooms for development to realize rapid, automatic and cost-effective sample-to-result genetic analysis. In this study, we propose an integrated rotary microfluidic system that is capable of performing glass microbead based DNA extraction, loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), and colorimetric lateral flow strip based detection in a sequential manner with an optimized microfluidic design and a rotational speed control. Rotation directiondependent coriolis force and siphon valving structures enable us to perform the fluidic control and metering, and the use of the lateral flow strip as a detection method renders all the analytical processes for nucleic acid test simplified and integrated without the need of expensive instruments or human intervention. As a proof of concept for point-of-care DNA diagnostics, we identified the food-borne bacterial pathogen which was contaminated in water or milk. Not only monoplex Salmonella Typhimurium but also multiplex Salmonella Typhimurium and Vibrio parahaemolyticus were analysed on the integrated rotary genetic analysis microsystem with a limit of detection of 50 CFU in 80 min. In addition, three multiple samples were simultaneously analysed on a single device. The sample-to-result capability of the proposed microdevice provides great usefulness in the fields of clinical diagnostics, food safety and environment monitoring.},

To facilitate sample preparation in POCT, various methods have been developed to operate microfluidic devices without complicated external pumping systems. In this review, we introduce an overview of user-friendly microfluidic devices for practical sample preparation in POCT, including self- and hand-operated microfluidic devices. Self-operated microfluidic devices exploit capillary force, vacuum-driven pressure, or gas-generating chemical reactions to apply pressure into microchannels, and hand-operated microfluidic devices utilize human power sources using simple equipment, including a syringe, pipette, or simply by using finger actuation. Furthermore, this review provides future perspectives to realize user-friendly integrated microfluidic circuits for wider applications with the integration of simple microfluidic valves.},

  abstract = {Water quality control and management in water resources are important for providing clean and safe water to the public. Due to their large area, collection, analysis, and management of a large amount of water quality data are essential. Water quality data are collected mainly by manual field sampling, and recently real-time sensor monitoring has been increasingly applied for efficient data collection. However, real-time sensor monitoring still relies on only a few parameters, such as water level, velocity, temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH. Although advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral images (HSI), have been used for the areal monitoring of algal bloom, other water quality sensors for organic compounds, phosphorus (P), and nitrogen (N) still need to be further developed and improved for field applications. The utilization of information and communications technology (ICT) with sensor technology shows great potential for the monitoring, transmission, and management of field water-quality data and thus for developing effective water quality management. This paper presents a review of the recent advances in ICT and field applicable sensor technology for monitoring water quality, mainly focusing on water resources, such as rivers and lakes, and discusses the challenges and future directions.},

The micro-dispensers, which can precisely transport a variety of droplet fluids in the {\textmu}L range, have received increasingly more attention in the area of lab-on-a-chip. In this paper, we present the design of a portable, efficient, accurate yet cost-effective micro-dispenser, which is ideal for improving simple laboratory applications. Our proposed design is comprised of the main frame and a disposable main tank for accommodating a bulk volume of sample fluid. The whole unit functions as an off-chip reservoir to transport the sample fluid to elsewhere through a passive valve. The height of the disposable main tank and the diameter of the passive valve are carefully designed upon the physical properties of the sample fluid. Moreover, our micro-dispenser is equipped with a flexible layer of elastic diaphragm. An electromagnetic actuator is utilized to produce push-pull force, while a Peltier thermoelectric device supported by a fuzzy logic controller is dedicated to controlling the temperature within the tank. The experimental measurements of our prototyped device exhibit that our proposed design features multiple advantages over the conventional methods, including repeatable dispensing, high accuracy, disposability, and controllable temperature.},

  abstract = {Recent advancements in Electrowetting on Dielectric (EWOD) systems, such as simplified fabrication, low-voltage actuation, and the development of more reliable materials, are expanding the potential applications of electrowetting actuators. One application of EWOD actuators is in RF devices to enable dynamic reconfiguration and allow real-time adjustments to frequency and bandwidth. In this paper, a method is introduced to actuate a panel using EWOD forces. In the EWOD system, the velocity of the plate increases by maximizing the actuation force, minimizing the moving mass (droplets and metalized plate), and reducing resistance (contact line drag, fluid drag). However, some of these are competing factors. For instance, the actuation force can be increased by increasing the number of droplets, but this also increases the inertia and the drag force. An analytical model of EWOD actuation is presented to understand system performance tradeoffs. The model is validated with an EWOD experiment, and the data demonstrate less than a 7.8\% error between the measured and predicted maximum plate velocities for different voltage inputs. In addition, this study presents a 3D numerical FEM model to analyze the velocity profile and viscous force in the thin droplets, focusing on variations along the droplet's height, which cannot be captured experimentally. The main advantage of the proposed system over previous works is the simple 2D manufacturing process, which allows embedding metalized plates and RF circuit boards, in addition to being compact, portable, and low-cost. In addition, the proposed method does not have any mechanical components, which can increase the system's reliability in a harsh environment.},

  abstract = {Interdigitated electrode arrays (IDAs) are often used for electrochemical detection using redox cycling for signal amplification. Its geometry, especially the gap width, is an important factor defining its electrochemical performance (sensitivity and collection efficiency). Minimal defect density on a wafer is a must, as a single shortcut prevents the function of the sensor chip. Therefore, the fabrication of interdigitated electrode arrays is a fundamental step in the integration of electrochemical sensors. This paper presents a novel fabrication approach that allows electrode spacing in the sub-micrometer region by using standard equipment such as UV Mask Aligner, physical vapor deposition and diffusion furnace. The fabrication procedure is a combination of dry etching, thermal oxidation and wet etching. This approach has potential to realize electrode distances down to 140 nm or even less. The proposed method enables the fabrication of sub-micron IDAs with the use of a conventional Mask Aligner and standard silicon technology. Moreover, it allows the electrode spacing adjustment without changing the mask design. The presented results demonstrate high sensitivity electrochemical sensors with amplification factors more than 12 without the need of e-beam lithography. Hence, this fabrication method offers a low-cost alternative to sub-micron e-beam written IDAs.},

Traditional methodologies for salmonella analysis provide high reliability and very low limits of detection. Among them immunoassays and Nucleic acid-based assays provide results within 24 h, but they are expensive, tedious and time consuming. So, there is an urgent need for development of rapid, robust and cost-effective alternative technologies for real-time monitoring of salmonella. Several biosensors have been designed and commercialized for detection of this pathogen in food and water. In this overview, we have updated the literature concerning novel biosensing methods such as various optical and electrochemical biosensors and newly developed nano- and micro-scaled and aptamers based biosensors for detection of salmonella pathogen. Furthermore, attention has been focused on the principal concepts, applications, and examples that have been achieved up to diagnose salmonella. In addition, commercial biosensors and foreseeable future trends for onsite detecting salmonella have been summarized.},

  abstract = {A concept of a nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membrane as a vibro-active micro/nano-filter in a micro hydro mechanical system for the filtration, separation, and manipulation of bioparticles is reported in this paper. For the fabrication of a nanoporous AAO, a two-step mild anodization (MA) and hard anodization (HA) technique was used. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to analyze the surface morphology of nanoporous AAO. A nanoporous structure with a pore diameter in the range of 50--90 nm, an interpore distance of 110 nm, and an oxide layer thickness of 0.12 mm with 60.72\% porosity was obtained. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were employed to evaluate AAO chemical properties. The obtained results showed that the AAO structure is of hexagonal symmetry and showed where Al2O3 is dominant. The hydrophobic properties of the nanoporous surface were characterized by water contact angle measurement. It was observed that the surface of the nanoporous AAO membrane is hydrophilic. Furthermore, to determine whether a nanomembrane could function as a vibro-active nano filter, a numerical simulation was performed using COMSOL Multiphysics 5.4 (COMSOL Inc, Stockholm, Sweden). Here, a membrane was excited at a frequency range of 0--100 kHz for surface acoustics wave (SAW) distribution on the surface of the nanoporous AAO using a PZT 5H cylinder (Piezo Hannas, Wuhan, China). The SAW, standing acoustic waves, and travelling acoustic waves of different wavelengths were excited to the fabricated AAO membrane and the results were compared with experimental ones, obtained from non-destructive testing method 3D scanning vibrometer (PSV-500-3D-HV, Polytec GmbH, Waldbronn, Germany) and holographic interferometry system (PRISM, Hy-Tech Forming Systems (USA), Phoenix, AZ, USA). Finally, a simulation of a single nanotube was performed to analyze the acoustic pressure distribution and time, needed to center nanoparticles in the nanotube.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) can identify substantial interactions by considering the datasets in the emerging era of technologies. It is widely applied in various applications, and healthcare is among them. AI plays a vital role in clinical applications in predicting the disease type, treating the disease, managing chronic situations, and diagnosing the same. AI has simplified the lives of doctors, patients, and administrators at hospitals in the healthcare environment by operating various tasks with lesser computation time and accurate results. The unique challenges such as AI's availability, accessibility, and affordability have contributed to the success of healthcare applications. Another factor that enhances the functionality of AI is based on the sourced medical data, which is analyzed, and a model is built to predict the disease by the application of Machine Learning (ML). The other reason for the successful application of AI in the healthcare environment is Computational Intelligence (CI), which is an analysis, design, theory, and development of linguistically and biologically motivated computational techniques. The functionality of CI is identified on the three pillars Fuzzy Systems, Neural Networks, and Evolutionary Computation. This research mainly discusses AI's various applications in the current healthcare environment. The discussion also includes the different branches of AI with their applications and working principles.},

Microfluidic chip includes a set of groves or microchannels that are engraved on different materials (glass, silicon, or polymers such as polydimethylsiloxane or PDMS, polymethylmethacrylate or PMMA). The microchannels forming the microfluidic chip are interconnected with each other for desired results. This organization of microchannels trapped into the microfluidic chip is associated with the outside by inputs and outputs penetrating through the chip, as an interface between the macro- and miniature world. With the help of a pump and a chip, microfluidic chip helps to determine the behavioral change of the microfluids. Inside the chip, there are microfluidic channels that permit the processing of the fluid, for example, blending and physicochemical responses. Microfluidic chip has numerous points of interest including lesser time and reagent utilization and alongside this, it can execute numerous activities simultaneously. The miniatured size of the chip fastens the reaction as the surface area increases. It is utilized in different biomedical applications such as food safety sensing, peptide analysis, tissue engineering, medical diagnosis, DNA purification, PCR activity, pregnancy, and glucose estimation.

  abstract = {Zinc imidazole framework-8, abbreviated as ZIF-8, is a member of the metal organic framework (MOF) family. The chemical architecture of ZIF-8 consists of zinc metal duly coordinated with an organic ligand/fragment, resulting in a cagelike three-dimensional network with unique porosity. Because of such a unique architecture and physicochemical property, ZIF-8 has recently been explored in various applications such as gas storage, catalysis, electrochemical sensing, drug delivery, etc. Electrochemical sensors are currently a hot topic in scientific advances, where small, portable, Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled devices powered by electrochemical output show a newer path toward chemo and biosensor applications. The unique electrochemical property of ZIF-8 is hence explored widely for possible electrochemical sensor applications. The application and synthesis of the bare ZIF-8 have been widely reported for more than a decade. However, new scientific advancements depict tailoring the bare ZIF-8 structure to achieve smart hybrid ZIF-8 materials that show more advanced properties compared to bare ZIF-8. The framework is formed by joining inorganic (metal-containing) units with organic linkers by reticular synthesis, which results in the formation of a cross-linked crystalline network with permanent porosity. This unique porosity of ZIF-8 has recently been utilized for the encapsulation of suitable guest species to enhance the native physicochemical activity of ZIF-8. These engineered ZIF-8 materials show excellent results, especially for electrochemical sensing application. This review is intended to describe the research, including the one done by our group, where the ZIF-8 pore size is used for encapsulating nanoparticles, enzymes, and organic compounds to avail suitable sensor applications.},

The scarcity of water supply is becoming a concern due to the growing population of human along with environment pollutions. Rainwater harvesting is considered the most accessible source which could be easily used for potable purposes both for household and commercial activities. Therefore, in this study, the physical, microbiological and chemical rainwater quality samples were analyzed using membrane filtration technique (ELE Paqualab 50), ICP-OES and Hach methods, to ensure the suitability of rainwater harvesting for domestic consumption. The study reveals that overall quality of the rainwater is quite satisfactory as per WHO and Malaysian standards, where the pH, turbidity, total dissolved solids, salinity, NO3-, SO42-, Zn and Pb were still under the permissible limits. However, the microbiological parameters (total coliform, fecal coliform and E. coli) and chemical (Cr) were found exceeded the standards, due to poor hygienic practices of the harvesting system. It can be concluded that the rainwater harvesting is still safe to drink and can be a potential alternative source of water supply in the future.},

Here, we report an All-in-One digital microfluidic (DMF) pipeline for proteomic sample reduction, alkylation, digestion, isotopic labeling and analysis. The system features end-to-end automation, with integrated thermal control for digestion, optimized droplet additives for sample manipulation and analysis, and an automated interface to liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Dimethyl labeling was integrated into the pipeline to allow for relative quantification of the trace samples at the nanogram level, and the new pipeline was applied to evaluating cancer cell lines and cancer tissue samples. Several known proteins (including HSP90AB1, HSPB1, LDHA, ENO1, PGK1, KRT18, and AKR1C2) and pathways were observed between model breast cancer cell lines related to hormone response, cell metabolism, and cell morphology. Furthermore, differentially quantified proteins (such as PGS2, UGDH, ASPN, LUM, COEA1, and PRELP) were found in comparisons of healthy and cancer breast tissues, suggesting potential utility of the All-in-One pipeline for the emerging application of proteomic cancer sub-typing. In sum, the All-in-One pipeline represents a powerful new tool for automated proteome processing and analysis, with the potential to be useful for evaluating mass-limited samples for a wide range of applications.},

The electrodes are biased by converting mechanical energy into electrical energy using an array of piezoelectric elements.           ,                             We report a finger-powered digital microfluidic device based on the electrophoretic transport of discrete droplets (EPD). An array of piezoelectric elements is connected in parallel to metal electrodes immersed in dielectric fluids. When deflected in a controlled sequence               via               human finger power, the piezoelectric elements charge and actuate droplets across each electrode pair through electrophoretic force. Successful droplet transportation requires the piezoelectric elements to provide both sufficient charge and voltage pulse duration. We quantify these requirements using numerical models to predict the electrical charges induced on the droplets and the corresponding electrophoretic forces. The models are experimentally validated by comparing the predicted and measured droplet translational velocities. We successfully demonstrated transport and merging of aqueous droplets over a range of droplet radii (0.6--0.9 mm). We further showed direct manipulation of body fluids, including droplets of saliva and urine, using our finger-powered EPD device. To facilitate practical implementation of multistep assays based on the approach, a hand/finger-rotated drum system with a programmable pattern of protrusions is designed to induce deflections of multiple piezoelectric elements and demonstrate programmable fluidic functions. An electrode-to-piezoelectric element connection scheme to minimize the number of piezoelectric elements necessary for a sequence of microfluidic functions is also explored. The present work establishes an engineering foundation to enable design and implementation of finger-powered portable EPD microfluidic devices.},

Parafilm and inexpensive laminating pouches were used to create a hydrophobic barrier for the assay on the {\textmu}PAD. This detection approach was selective to type-II pyrethroids in water for which an environmental water sample was tested. The calibration curves for cypermethrin, deltamethrin, cyhalothrin, and fenvalerate ranged from 2 to 40 {\textmu}g/mL without sample preconcentration. The lower concentrations of type-II pyrethroids can be assessed by including a preconcentration step prior to the detection on a {\textmu}PAD. This detection system provides an alternative platform for fast, semiquantitative testing for pesticide contamination in environmental surface water by allowing for portability, low reagent/sample consumption, and low-cost testing.},

  abstract = {Lab-on-PCB devices have been developed for many biomedical and biochemical applications. However, much work has to be done towards commercial applications. Even so, the research on devices of this kind is rapidly increasing. The reason for this lies in the great potential of lab-on-PCB devices to provide marketable devices. This review describes the active flow driving methods for lab-on-PCB devices, while commenting on their main characteristics. Among others, the methods described are the typical external impulsion devices, that is, syringe or peristaltic pumps; pressurized microchambers for precise displacement of liquid samples; electrowetting on dielectrics; and electroosmotic and phase-change-based flow driving, to name a few. In general, there is not a perfect method because all of them have drawbacks. The main problems with regard to marketable devices are the complex fabrication processes, the integration of many materials, the sealing process, and the use of many facilities for the PCB-chips. The larger the numbers of integrated sensors and actuators in the PCB-chip, the more complex the fabrication. In addition, the flow driving-integrated devices increase that difficulty. Moreover, the biological applications are demanding. They require transparency, biocompatibility, and specific ambient conditions. All the problems have to be solved when trying to reach repetitiveness and reliability, for both the fabrication process and the working of the lab-on-PCB, including the flow driving system.},

Historically, PCB substrates have been used to support the components of the electronic devices, linking them using copper lines, and providing input and output pads to connect the rest of the system. In addition, this kind of substrate is an emerging material for biomedical engineering thanks to its many interesting characteristics, such as its commercial availability at a low cost with very good tolerance and versatility, due to its multilayer characteristics; that is, the possibility of using several metals and substrate layers. The alternative uses of copper, gold, Flame Retardant 4 (FR4) and silver layers, together with the use of vias, solder masks and a rigid and flexible substrate, are noted. Among other uses, these characteristics have been using to develop many sensors, biosensors and actuators, and PCB-based lab-on chips; for example, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) amplification devices for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). In addition, several applications of these devices are going to be noted in this paper, and two tables summarizing the layers' functions are included in the discussion: the first one for metallic layers, and the second one for the vias, solder mask, flexible and rigid substrate functions.},

Demonstrated capabilities include the enrichment of haematopoetic stem cells from bone marrow and peripheral blood, and adult stem cells from adipose tissue. Recent research suggests that this technique can predict the ultimate fate of neural stem cells after differentiation               before               the appearance of specific cell-surface proteins. This review summarises the properties of cells that contribute to their dielectrophoretic behaviour, and their relevance to stem cell research and translational applications.},

  abstract = {Dielectrophoresis is the motion of particles caused by electrical polarization effects in inhomogeneous (nonuniform) electric fields. Unlike electrophoresis, the particles do not require a net electrical charge for motion to occur and AC rather than DC fields are employed to exploit the dielectric properties of the particles. Factors controlling the effective dielectric properties of cells and microorganisms include electrical double layers associated with surface charges, the conductivity and permittivity of their membranes and any cell walls, and their morphologies and structural archtectures. In recent years, several laboratories have developed separation and manipulation techniques for cells and niicroorganisms based on dielectrophoresis, using both static and traveling AC fields. In this article, the basic physical factors influencing the dielectrophoretic behavior of particles are outlined, and ways in which these can be employed to achieve selective separation of cells and microorganisms are described.},

  abstract = {A review is presented of the present status of the theory, the developed technology and the current applications of dielectrophoresis (DEP). Over the past 10 years around 2000 publications have addressed these three aspects, and current trends suggest that the theory and technology have matured sufficiently for most effort to now be directed towards applying DEP to unmet needs in such areas as biosensors, cell therapeutics, drug discovery, medical diagnostics, microfluidics, nanoassembly, and particle filtration. The dipole approximation to describe the DEP force acting on a particle subjected to a nonuniform electric field has evolved to include multipole contributions, the perturbing effects arising from interactions with other cells and boundary surfaces, and the influence of electrical double-layer polarizations that must be considered for nanoparticles. Theoretical modelling of the electric field gradients generated by different electrode designs has also reached an advanced state. Advances in the technology include the development of sophisticated electrode designs, along with the introduction of new materials (e.g., silicone polymers, dry film resist) and methods for fabricating the electrodes and microfluidics of DEP devices (photo and electron beam lithography, laser ablation, thin film techniques, CMOS technology). Around three-quarters of the 300 or so scientific publications now being published each year on DEP are directed towards practical applications, and this is matched with an increasing number of patent applications. A summary of the US patents granted since January 2005 is given, along with an outline of the small number of perceived industrial applications (e.g., mineral separation, micropolishing, manipulation and dispensing of fluid droplets, manipulation and assembly of micro components). The technology has also advanced sufficiently for DEP to be used as a tool to manipulate nanoparticles (e.g., carbon nanotubes, nano wires, gold and metal oxide nanoparticles) for the fabrication of devices and sensors. Most efforts are now being directed towards biomedical applications, such as the spatial manipulation and selective separation/enrichment of target cells or bacteria, high-throughput molecular screening, biosensors, immunoassays, and the artificial engineering of three-dimensional cell constructs. DEP is able to manipulate and sort cells without the need for biochemical labels or other bioengineered tags, and without contact to any surfaces. This opens up potentially important applications of DEP as a tool to address an unmet need in stem cell research and therapy.},

This problem involves multidisciplinary expertise combining research knowledge from various areas, including wet chemistry, biochemistry, physical chemistry, molecular biology, genetics, signal processing, microelectronics material science, and separation science. It has been documented that fairly primitive but fast and inexpensive screening methods involving paper-based analytical devices (PADs) and micro total analytical systems ({$\mu$}TAS) can be considered as serious alternatives to their more advanced counterparts such as GC, HPLC, and capillary electrophoresis coupled to various sophisticated detectors (e.g., multiwavelength spectrophotometers such as UV-Vis/DAD and mass spectrometers). The main advantage of PAD- and {$\mu$}TAS-driven technology is that such sensing devices may work under on-site and real-time conditions and measure a number of physical parameters and chemical factors simultaneously. Moreover, hybrid miniaturized analytical systems may combine sensing and data acquisition modules with common mobile phones and electronic devices working with global positioning systems and communicating through the Internet.},

To control the movement of DW ink droplets on dielectric substrates, the electrodes were embedded in the substrate. It is demonstrated that droplets of pure liquid inks, aqueous polymer solution inks, and carbon fiber suspension inks can be moved on multi-angled surfaces. Also, experimental results reveal that droplets of a commercial hydrogel, agar-agar, alginate, xanthan gum, and gum arabic can be moved by electrowetting. Droplets of sizes 200 {$\mu$}m-3 mm were manipulated and moved by the electric field on different dielectric substrates accurately and repeatedly. Effective electrowetting-based control and movement of droplets were observed on horizontal, vertical, and even inverted substrates. These findings imply the feasibility and potential application of electrowetting as a flexible, rapid, and new method for ink droplet control in 3D printing processes.},

  abstract = {Digital (droplet-based) microfluidic technology offers an attractive platform for implementing a wide variety of biochemical laboratory protocols, such as point-of-care diagnosis, DNA analysis, target detection, and drug discovery. A digital microfluidic biochip consists of a patterned array of electrodes on which tiny fluid droplets are manipulated by electrical actuation sequences to perform various fluidic operations, for example, dispense, transport, mix, or split. However, because of the inherent uncertainty of fluidic operations, the outcome of biochemical experiments performed on-chip can be erroneous even if the chip is tested a priori and deemed to be defect-free. In this article, we address an important error recoverability problem in the context of sample preparation. We assume a cyberphysical environment, in which the physical errors, when detected online at selected checkpoints with integrated sensors, can be corrected through recovery techniques. However, almost all prior work on error recoverability used checkpointing-based               rollback               approach, that is, re-execution of certain portions of the protocol starting from the previous checkpoint. Unfortunately, such techniques are expensive both in terms of assay completion time and reagent cost, and can never ensure full error-recovery in deterministic sense. We consider imprecise droplet mix-split operations and present a novel               roll-forward               approach where the erroneous droplets, thus produced, are used in the error-recovery process, instead of being discarded or remixed. All erroneous droplets participate in the dilution process and they mutually cancel or reduce the concentration-error when the target droplet is reached. We also present a rigorous analysis that reveals the role of volumetric-error on the concentration of a sample to be prepared, and we describe the layout of a lab-on-chip that can execute the proposed cyberphysical dilution algorithm. Our analysis reveals that fluidic errors caused by unbalanced droplet splitting can be classified as being either               critical               or               non-critical               , and only those of the former type require correction to achieve error-free sample dilution. Simulation experiments on various sample preparation test cases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Efficient actuation of liquid slugs in microfluidic circuits is a matter of interest in droplet-based microfluidic applications. In this paper, the Electrowetting On Dielectric (EWOD) actuation of a liquid slug fully confined in a microchannel is studied. A set of experiments are conducted in which the mean transport velocity of a liquid slug enclosed in a microchannel of rectangular cross section and actuated by EWOD method is measured. A printed circuit board based (PCB-based) microfluidic chip is used as the platform, and the transport velocity of the slug is measured by processing the images recorded by a high-speed camera while the slug moves in the channel. To investigate the effect of microchannel geometry on the mean transport velocity of the slugs, different channel heights and widths (ranging between 250 െ 440 ݉ߤ and 1-2 mm, respectively) as well as different liquid volumes (ranging between 2.94 െ 5.15 ܮߤ ) are tested and slug velocities up to 14.9 mm/s are achieved. A theoretical model is also developed to analyze the effect of involved parameters on the transport velocity. The results show that, within the range of design parameters considered in this study, for a constant slug volume and channel width, increasing the channel height enhances the velocity. Moreover, keeping the slug volume and channel height fixed, the transport velocity is increased by enlarging the channel width. An inverse proportionality between the slug length and velocity is also observed. These results are also shown to agree with the theoretical model developed.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting on Dielectric (EWOD) method is widely used to actuate microdroplets sandwiched between parallel plates in microfluidic chips. However, utilization of this method to transport liquid plugs in conduits has not been comprehensively studied to date. In this paper, the EWOD actuation of a liquid plug confined in a microchannel of rectangular cross section is numerically studied using OpenFoam. The effect of various parameters including electrowetting dimensionless number ({$\eta$}), contact angle hysteresis (CAH), dynamic viscosity and surface tension coefficient on transport velocity is investigated by employing an interactive simulation approach. The transport velocity can be considered a gauge to evaluate the actuation efficiency. The results show that, increasing {$\eta$} has a greater impact on velocity for larger values of CAH. In addition, it is shown that the average velocity increases linearly by increasing the surface tension coefficient. An inverse relationship between velocity and dynamic viscosity is also observed. These trends are in accordance with the theoretical model developed for a similar case in the literature. To estimate the maximum possible gap size between electrodes (MPGS), non-actuated distance travelled before the liquid plug comes to stop is evaluated. The results show that by decreasing the values of {$\eta$}, the effect of changing CAH on MPGS becomes more substantial.},

  abstract = {Environmental pollution and its drastic effects on human and animal health have urged governments to implement strict policies to minimize damage. The first step in applying such policies is to find reliable methods to detect pollution in various media, including water, food, soil, and air. In this regard, various approaches such as spectrophotometric, chromatographic, and electrochemical techniques have been proposed. To overcome the limitations associated with conventional analytical methods, microfluidic devices have emerged as sensitive technologies capable of generating high content information during the past few years. The passage of contaminant samples through the microfluidic channels provides essential details about the whole environment after detection by the detector. In the meantime, artificial intelligence is an ideal means to identify, classify, characterize, and even predict the data obtained from microfluidic systems. The development of microfluidic devices with integrated machine learning and artificial intelligence is promising for the development of nextgeneration monitoring systems. Combination of the two systems ensures time efficient setups with easy operation. This review article is dedicated to the recent developments in microfluidic chips coupled with artificial intelligence technology for the evolution of more convenient pollution monitoring systems.},

A synthetic polymer is developed in this study using Molecularly Imprinted Polymerization (MIP) technology with the precipitation polymerization method. The MIP polymer is used for finding the levels of creatinine from human serum samples with different creatinine concentrations. The MIP polymer is very selective to the specific adsorption of the molecules of creatinine. The produced MIP polymer is suitable for evaluating creatinine concentrations until 50 parts per million (ppm) that is thrice greater than the standard. The fabrication of chip-sized Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS)-based interdigital (ID) sensors is described. The operation of the MEMS sensor is verified using the technique of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). The presented details of the development of MEMS ID sensor and creatinine specific MIP polymer are for detecting raised biotoxic waste levels, i.e. creatinine management is part of our research. The raised levels need monitoring by frequent pathological visits to those patients who have impaired kidney functioning. The complete system will be helpful for creatinine management at any time from home at a low cost. While early detection of an increase in creatinine and monitoring of kidney health to prevent further healthrelated complications are the goal of this research, results of up to 50 ppm are accessed. Until 50 ppm of MIP functionality is checked for confirming the MIP polymer adsorption of creatinine and the results are shown, which helps establish the sensing technology even if used for a patient with a high creatinine level.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of high technology, chemical science is not as it used to be a century ago. Many chemists acquire and utilize skills that are well beyond the traditional definition of chemistry. The digital age has transformed chemistry laboratories. One aspect of this transformation is the progressing implementation of electronics and computer science in chemistry research. In the past decade, numerous chemistry-oriented studies have benefited from the implementation of electronic modules, including microcontroller boards (MCBs), single-board computers (SBCs), professional grade control and data acquisition systems, as well as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In particular, MCBs and SBCs provide good value for money. The application areas for electronic modules in chemistry research include construction of simple detection systems based on spectrophotometry and spectrofluorometry principles, customizing laboratory devices for automation of common laboratory practices, control of reaction systems (batch- and flow-based), extraction systems, chromatographic and electrophoretic systems, microfluidic systems (classical and nonclassical), custom-built polymerase chain reaction devices, gas-phase analyte detection systems, chemical robots and drones, construction of FPGA-based imaging systems, and the Internet-of-Chemical-Things. The technology is easy to handle, and many chemists have managed to train themselves in its implementation. The only major obstacle in its implementation is probably one's imagination.},

  abstract = {Paper-based analytical devices have become lately ``must have'' components in equipment and instrumental designed for point-of-care applications, especially when they are used in tandem with microfluidic platforms. Nowadays, paper-based electrochemical devices (PEDs) represent the first choice in the development of lab-on-a-chip biosensors because of their benefits in biomedical diagnosis in terms of simplicity, affordability, portability, and disposability. Moreover, cellulose is a biodegradable and biocompatible substrate, ideal for building disposable devices for use in remote locations or low-resource settings. Despite their low costs and simplicity, PEDs must face a tough challenge---meeting the affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid and robust, equipment-free, and deliverable to end users criteria. The latest achievements in microfluidic PEDs for clinical diagnosis will be critically discussed, putting emphasis on innovative assay formats and methods for surface modification.},

  abstract = {Rapid screening of pathogenic bacteria contaminated foods is crucial to prevent food poisoning. However, available methods for bacterial detection are still not ready for in-field screening because culture is timeconsuming; PCR requires complex DNA extraction and ELISA lacks sensitivity. In this study, a microfluidic biosensor was developed for rapid, sensitive and automatic detection of Salmonella using metal-organic framework (MOF) NH2-MIL-101(Fe) with mimic peroxidase activity to amplify biological signal and Raspberry Pi with self-developed App to analyze color image. First, the target bacteria were separated and concentrated with the immune magnetic nanobeads (MNBs), and labeled with the immune MOFs to form MNB-Salmonella-MOF complexes. Then, the complexes were used to catalyze colorless o-phenylenediamine and H2O2 to produce yellow 2,3-diaminophenazine (DAP). Finally, the image of the catalysate was collected under the narrow-band blue light and analyzed using the Raspberry Pi App to determine the bacterial concentration. The experimental results showed that this biosensor was able to detect Salmonella Typhimurium from 1.5 {\texttimes} 101 to 1.5 {\texttimes} 107 CFU/mL in 1 h with the lower detection limit of 14 CFU/mL. The mean recovery for Salmonella in spiked chicken meats was {\textasciitilde}112\%. This biosensor integrating mixing, separation, labelling and detection onto a single microfluidic chip has demonstrated the merits of automatic operation, fast reaction, less reagent and small size, and is promising for infield detection of foodborne bacteria.},

This study describes an integrated sensing system with solution-processed pH, free chlorine, and temperature sensors on a common glass substrate. The pH and temperature sensors are fabricated by low-cost inkjet printing of palladium/palladium oxide and silver. The potentiometric pH sensor has a high sensitivity of 60.6 mV/pH and a fast response of 15 s. The Wheatstone-bridge-based temperature sensor shows an immediate response of 3.35 mV/{\textopenbullet}C towards temperature change. The free chlorine sensor is based on an electrochemically modified pencil lead, which exhibits a stable and reproducible sensitivity of 342 nA/ppm for hypochlorous acid. Such a free chlorine sensor is potentiostat-free and calibrationfree, so it is easy-to-use. The three sensors are connected to a field-programmable gate array board for data collection, analysis and display, with real-time pH and temperature compensation for free chlorine sensing. The developed sensing system is user-friendly, cost-effective, and can monitor water samples in real-time with an accuracy of {$>$}82\%.

However, due to the limitation of electrodes number, the throughput is hard to further upgrade. Therefore, active matrix electrowetting-on-dielectric (AM-EWOD) technology is a solution to acquire larger scale of driving electrodes. However, the process of manufacturing of AM-EWOD based on thin-film-transistor (TFT) is complex and expensive. Besides, the driving voltage of DMF chip is usually much higher than that of common display products.In this paper, a solution for mass production of AM-EWOD based on amorphous silicon (a-Si) is provided. Samples of 32 {\texttimes} 32 matrix AM-EWOD chips was designed and manufactured. A boost circuit was integrated into the pixel, which can raise the pixel voltage up by about 50\%. Customized designed Printed Circuit Board (PCB) was used to supply the timing signals and driving voltage to make the motion of droplets programmable. The process of moving, mixing and generation of droplets was demonstrated.The minimum voltage in need was about 20 V and a velocity of up to 96 mm/s was achieved. Such an DMF device with large-scale matrix and low driving voltage will be very suitable for POCT applications.},

However, it is time-consuming (1--2 days) and requires specialized laboratory and personnel. This study reported a deep learning enhanced digital microfluidic platform for multiplex detection of viable foodborne pathogens. The new method used a Time-Lapse images driven EfficientNet-Transformer Network (TLENTNet) to type and quantify the bacteria through spatiotemporal features of bacterial growth and digital enumeration of bacterial culture. First, the bacterial sample was prepared with LB medium and injected into a pre-vacuumed microfluidic chip with an array of 800 microwells to encapsulate at most one bacterium in each well. Then, a programmed sliding microscopic platform was used to scan all microwells every 15 min, capturing time-lapse images of bacterial growth within each microwell. Finally, the TLENTNet was used to facilitate bacterial typing and quantification. Under optimal conditions, this platform was able to detect four bacterial species (S. typhimurium, E. coli O157:H7, S. aureus and B. cereus) with an average accuracy of 97.72\% and a detection limit of 63 CFU/mL in 7 h.},

Moreover, we demonstrate that dielectrowetting can be used to prevent droplet bouncing and suppress splashing. In our experiments, the dielectrowetting effect is produced on a flat substrate by two thin interdigitated electrodes connected to an alternating current potential. Our findings show that the strength of the electric potential can affect the dynamic contact angle and regulate the spreading, splashing and receding dynamics at the right time-scales.},

  abstract = {Buffer liquids currently used in biotechnology contain surfactants. These surfactants modify the wetting properties of the liquid and affect the behavior of droplets in electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) microsystems. An analysis of the effect of surfactants in EWOD-based microsystems, at equilibrium and in a non-equilibrium state, is given here. First, a reference for the value of the surface tension and its time variation is obtained by the use of the pendant drop method, showing that the time variation of the surface tension follows a decreasing exponential law. Next, equilibrium experiments have been performed on a specially designed EWOD experimental microsystem. It has been observed that the Lippmann--Young theoretical equation for electrowetting is satisfied at equilibrium, even in the presence of surfactants. However, at the CMC, equilibrium surface tension values are different from those obtained by the pendant drop method. This difference is explained by an internal convective motion that remixes the surfactants. This internal motion is observed by following the motion of fluorophores. Consequently, surfactant concentrations about ten times the CMC are required to obtain the same values of the surface tension in the pendant drop method and by EWOD measurements. In a second section, it is shown that the behavior of surfactant-loaded droplets in EWOD-based microsystems can be explained by considering that the surface tension relaxes with time according to the exponential law found in the first section.},

A rubella virus (RV) IgG immunoassay was developed to evaluate the diagnostic potential for the new system, relying on magnetic microparticles coated with RV particles and analysis by differential pulse voltammetry. The limit of detection of the assay (0.07 IU mL               -1               ) was {$>$}100{\texttimes} below the World Health Organization defined cut-off for rubella immunity. The sensitivity of the integrated device and its small size suggest future utility for distributed diagnostics.},

  abstract = {A wireless sensor network (WSN) has a huge potential in water ecology monitoring applications. The integration of WSN to a portable sensing device offers the feasibility of sensing distribution capability, on-site data measurements, and remote sensing abilities. Due to the advancement of WSN technology, unexpected contamination events in water environments can be observed continuously. Local Area Network (LAN), Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) and Internet web-based are commonly used as a gateway unit for data communication via local base computer using standard Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) or General Packet Radio Services (GPRS). However, WSN construction is costly and a growing static infrastructure increases the energy consumptions. Hence, a growing trend of smartphone-based application in the field of water monitoring is a surrogate approach to engage mobile base stations for in-field analysis that are driven by the expanding adaptation of Bluetooth, ZigBee and standard Wi-Fi routers. Owing to the fact that smartphones are portable and accessible, mobile data collection from WSN in remote locations are achievable. This paper comprehensively reviews the detection of water contaminants using smartphone-based applications in accordance with WSN technologies. In this paper, some recommendations and prospective views on the developments of water quality monitoring will be discussed.},

Heavy metals, pharmaceuticals waste, organic, and inorganic contaminants present in wastewater have shown significant threats to the environment and public health globally. Currently available monitoring techniques involve complex equipment, longer processing time, and highly skilled professionals, making these techniques inadequate. Towards achieving a portable, highly sensitive, and selective water quality control system, microfluidic devices have emerged as the technique for the need of the hour. Several researchers have turned their attention to the microfluidic devices and have been doing extensive research on the development and application of microfluidic-based devices for the detection of water contaminants. Considering the fact that microfluidic devices have already marking an impact in this field, this review article discusses latest development on the microfluidic-based water quality control devices.

Approximately 1 in 5 cases of mortality due to waterborne diseases involve children, and over 1.5 million cases of waterborne disease occur every year. In the developing world, this makes waterborne diseases the second highest cause of mortality. Such cases of waterborne disease are thought to be caused by poor sanitation, water infrastructure, public knowledge, and lack of suitable water monitoring systems. Conventional laboratory-based techniques are inadequate for effective on-site water quality monitoring purposes. This is due to their need for excessive equipment, operational complexity, lack of affordability, and long sample collection to data analysis times. In this review, we discuss the conventional techniques used in modern-day water quality testing. We discuss the future challenges of water quality testing in the developing world and how conventional techniques fall short of these challenges. Finally, we discuss the development of electrochemical biosensors and current research on the integration of these devices with microfluidic components to develop truly integrated, portable, simple to use and cost-effective devices for use by local environmental agencies, NGOs, and local communities in low-resource settings.},

A new electrode shape is proposed which provides a uniform actuation force at the contact line as well as overlap between the adjacent electrodes. The onset of actuation and droplet mobility on electrode arrays have been investigated. The numerical method is based on volume of fluid technique to track the 3-D interface along with a Laplace equation solver to calculate the electric field in the domain. Furthermore, the dynamic behaviour of three-phase contact line is modeled using molecular-kinetic theory. Validation experiments were carried out to characterize the droplet actuation by various electrode shapes. The superior performance of the new electrode shape is demonstrated by comparing the droplet velocity and deformation, as well as contact angle distribution of those of a simple flat electrode.},

DMFBs offer various advantages over traditional laboratory techniques and reduces cost, and increases automation and software programmability. Scheduling of microfluidic operations is the first and essential step in the fluidic-level synthesis of DMFBs, while the other two are the module placement and droplet routing. Scheduling DMFB operations is a multiconstrained optimization problem, and the particular decision problem is NP-complete. We propose a hybrid artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm using generalized N-point crossover (GNX) based scheduling of DMFB operations. Proposed ABC-GNX perturbs through search space, evaluates various schedules possible, and returns the best schedule among the evaluated schedules. Simple list scheduling based heuristic algorithms can explore a single schedule based on the sequence generated by the priority function. Iterative improvement based search algorithms explore the search space and evaluate more schedules, but the proposed ABC-GNX algorithm produces optimal solutions in shorter execution times. Simulation results show that the proposed ABC-GNX produces a higher number of optimal completion times and faster execution times than existing algorithms.},

Isolation and detection of a particular type of pathogen present at low concentration in a large volume of water, concentrating the analyte in a small detection volume, and removing detection inhibiting factors from the concentrated sample, present the three most important challenges for water quality monitoring laboratories. Combining advanced biological detection methods (e.g., nucleic acid-based or immunology-based protocols) with microfluidics and immunomagnetic separation techniques that exploit functionalized magnetic particles has tremendous potential for realization of an integrated system for pathogen detection, in particular, of waterborne pathogens. Taking advantage of the unique properties of magnetic particles, faster, more sensitive, and more economical diagnostic assays can be developed that can assist in the battle against microbial pathogenesis. In this review, we highlight current technologies and methods used for realization of magnetic particle-based microfluidic integrated waterborne pathogen isolation and detection systems, which have the potential to comply in future with regulatory water quality monitoring requirements.},

One of the potential fields of application for this technology is in Point-of-Care (POC) devices, ideally allowing for portable, fully integrated, easy to use, low cost diagnostic platforms. Two main approaches exist to induce Dielectrophoresis (DEP) on suspended particles, i.e., electrode-based DEP and insulator-based DEP, each featuring different advantages and disadvantages. However, a shared concern lies in the input voltage used to generate the electric field necessary for DEP to take place. Therefore, input voltage can determine portability of a microfluidic device.

  abstract = {EIS is mainly employed for immunosensors and aptasensors, but opportunities exist for enzymatic, composite and other sensor strategies.           ,              Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful technique for both quantitative and qualitative analysis. This review uses a systematic approach to examine how electrodes are tailored for use in EIS-based applications, describing the chemistries involved in sensor design, and discusses trends in the use of bio-based and non-bio-based electrodes. The review finds that immunosensors are the most prevalent sensor strategy that employs EIS as a quantification technique for target species. The review also finds that bio-based electrodes, though capable of detecting small molecules, are most applicable for the detection of complex molecules. Non-bio-based sensors are more often employed for simpler molecules and less often have applications for complex systems. We surmise that EIS has advanced in terms of electrode designs since our last review on the subject, although there are still inconsistencies in terms of equivalent circuit modelling for some sensor types. Removal of ambiguity from equivalent circuit models may help advance EIS as a choice detection method, allowing for lower limits of detection than traditional electrochemical methods such as voltammetry or amperometry.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Extensive agriculture activities in the upstream area causes pollutants flow to the downstream area and contaminate the drinking water resources. Methods: Water samples were collected from 27 sampling points of Bertam River in Cameron Highlands, during wet season in September 2017 for physicochemical properties and heavy metals analyses. Potential health risk was calculated based on the heavy metals concentration detected. Results: The pH value of the river ranged from neutral to slightly acidic (6.15-7.01). The overall mean level of turbidity (109.94 {\textpm} 160.73 NTU), DO (7.86 {\textpm} 0.71 mg/L), E. coli (5191.00 {\textpm} 14937.42 CFU/100 mL), and NH3-N (0.85 {\textpm} 0.54 mg/L) were exceeded the National Standard for Drinking Water Quality (NSDWQ) (Ministry of Health Malaysia). The concentration of heavy metals were in the following order; Fe{$>$}Al{$>$}Cu{$>$}Zn{$>$}Pb{$>$}Cd. The overall mean concentration of Cd (0.015 {\textpm} 0.007 mg/L), Fe (0.442 {\textpm} 0.191 mg/L) and Pb (0.021 {\textpm} 0.005 mg/L) were exceeded the national standard (NSDWQ). The non-carcinogenic health risk for adult and children from daily water consumption was within an acceptable risk. There is a potential cancer risk through Cd exposure in the drinking water where the risk higher among children (4.92 x 10-3), followed by adult male (3.06 x 10-3) and adult female (2.98 x 10-3). Conclusion: Significant heavy metals contamination and health risk through water consumption were observed in the highland river watershed, possibly due to the anthropogenic activities.},

In this review, we discuss how liquid-infused surfaces offer a promising platform to expand the capabilities of PON devices in the areas of biological sample preparation and system integration, providing new methods of controlling the movement of droplets and facilitating detection of biological and chemical compounds contained therein. Modifications to the underlying surface structure can be used to passively control the direction of droplet movement, and the careful selection of responsive solid substrates and/or overlying liquids can allow active control through induced temperature gradients, electrical stimulation, and exposure to magnetic fields. Recent work leveraging other advantages of liquid-infused systems such as ultra-low friction, noncoalescence of droplets, and liquid--liquid patterning has demonstrated the unique ways in which this approach can be used to both enhance current detection methods as well as enable new ones. Together, these recent developments in the manipulation of droplets on liquid-infused surfaces point to their significant potential for furthering the capacity of PON devices for both biological and environmental samples.},

Here, microfluidic devices are reviewed that generate those inhomogeneous electric fields with insulating posts or constrictions, an approach called electrodeless or insulator-based dielectrophoresis. Possible advantages compared to electrode-based designs are a less complex, monolithic fabrication process with low-cost polymeric substrates and no metal surface deterioration within the area of sample analysis. The electrodeless design has led to novel devices, implementing the functionality directly into the channel geometry and covering many areas of bioanalysis, like manipulation and separation of particles, cells, DNA, and proteins.},

This includes the working principles, detection methods, and application fields of MES technology. MES are made of amorphous metallic glass ribbons and are wireless and passive, meaning that it is convenient to monitor or measure the parameters related to biomedical engineering. MES are based on the inverse magnetoelastic (Villari) effect. When MES are subjected to mechanical stress, their magnetic susceptibility will change accordingly. And the susceptibility of MES is directly related to their magnetic permeability. The varying permeability can positively reflect the applied stress. The various detection methods that have been developed for different field applications include measurement of force, stress, and strain, monitoring of various chemical indexes, and consideration of different biomedical parameters such as the degradation rate and force conditions of artificial bone, as well as various physiological indexes including ammonia level, glucose concentration, bacteria growth, and blood coagulation.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic has recently been under intensive study, as an effective method to carry out liquid manipulation in Lab-On-a-Chip (LOC) systems. Among droplet actuation forces, ElectroWetting on Dielectric (EWOD) and Liquid DiElectroPhoresis (LDEP) are powerful tools, used in many LOC platforms. Such digital microfluidic transductions do not require integration of complex mechanical components such as pumps and valves to perform the fluidic operations. However, although LDEP has been proved to be efficient to carry and manipulate biological components in insulating liquids, this microfluidic transduction requires several hundreds of volts at relatively high frequencies (kHz to MHz). With the purpose to develop integrated microsystems {\textmu}-TAS (Micro Total Analysis System) or Point of Care systems, the goal here is to reduce such high actuation voltage, the power consumption, though using standard dielectric materials. This paper gives key rules to determine the best tradeoff between liquid manipulation efficiency, low-power consumption and robustness of microsystems using LDEP actuation. This study leans on an electromechanical model to describe liquid manipulation that is applied to an experimental setup, and provides precise quantification of both actuation voltage Vth and frequency fc thresholds between EWOD and LDEP regimes. In particular, several parameters will be investigated to quantify Vth and fc, such as the influence of the chip materials, the electrodes size and the device configurations. Compared to current studies in the field, significant reduction of both Vth and fc is achieved by optimization of the aforementioned parameters.},

  abstract = {As one of the most common inorganic ions in daily food and ecological environment, nitrate (NO3-) is potentially harmful to both environment and humans. Therefore, the detection of nitrate concentration is quite important. Chemical sensors, as analytical measurement tools, usually demonstrate high selectivity, fast analysis speed, simple structure, convenient operation, and low cost and are considered to be a promising method for ion identification and detection. In this paper, a miniaturized electrochemical electrode is fabricated based on the microfabrication technology, and an electrochemical sensor for the detection of nitrate concentration in water is developed by combining the deposition technology of nanometal particles with electrochemical analysis technique. The developed electrochemical sensor utilizes electrochemical deposition to prepare a copper (Cu) granular sensitive film with a branch-cluster structure on the surface of a circular working electrode (Pt). Using copper's characteristics of electrocatalytic reduction of NO3- in the acid solution environment (pH\,=\,2), the concentration of NO3- in the water sample was calculated by measuring the reduction current on the working electrode when the electrocatalytic reduction reaction of NO3- occurred on the surface of the copper-sensitive membrane. The sensitive film is characterized and detected both with the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) technique; and the microsensor is used to detect nitrate standard samples; a high detection sensitivity (24.9\,{$\mu$}A/mmol{$\cdot$}L-1) is achieved in the concentration range of 0.0 to 3.0\,mmol/L. At the same time, a MEMS three-electrode sensor without gold wire bonding and insulating glue packaging is designed, and an automatic detection system is constructed with a STM32f103 microcontroller as the controller to realize the automated detecting process for nitrate ions. At the same time, a distributed system is constructed, which can describe the nitrate concentration in every position of the water area and realize the monitoring of the whole water area. The detection system can meet the working environment under most conditions and has practical significance.},

This natural disaster has put millions of lives at risk and forcing the people to search for waster. However, the water scarcity problem was not just limited to the countries that were strike by El-Nino. Poor water management and climate change were bringing droughts to Asia and the Pacific. The water scarcity worldwide has recently reached the alarming rate and received the greatest attention among the people. Membrane technology is an innovative technology which has proven to be effective and efficient for water and wastewater treatment. Therefore, membrane technology has high potential to be employed for the treatment of lake water, mine water, and tube well water in increasing the fresh water production for reuse purpose. The objective of this work is to investigate the potential of membrane technology for treating the lake water, mine water, and tube well water. A laboratory bench-scale dead-end test rig was used in this study to evaluate the performance of commercial flatsheet nanofiltration (NF) - NF270 and reverse osmosis (RO) - BW30 membranes. Both source water and treated water were analysed based on chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), colour, total suspended solid (TSS), pH, and temperature. In order to prove the reuse concept of membrane technology, the permeate water quality after the membrane filtration process was compared with National Water Quality Standard (NWQS) of Malaysia. The results from this study shown that the permeate water filtered by NF270 and BW30 membranes were able to meet the NWQS Class III, which was suitable to recycled for livestock drinking and irrigation purposes.},

  abstract = {The growing biopharmaceutical industry has reached a level of maturity that allows for the monitoring of numerous key variables for both process characterization and outcome predictions. Sensors were historically used in order to maintain an optimal environment within the reactor to optimize process performance. However, technological innovation has pushed towards on-line in situ continuous monitoring of quality attributes that could previously only be estimated offline. These new sensing technologies when coupled with software models have shown promise for unique fingerprinting, smart process control, outcome improvement, and prediction. All this can be done without requiring invasive sampling or intervention on the system. In this paper, the state-of-the-art sensing technologies and their applications in the context of cell culture monitoring are reviewed with emphasis on the coming push towards industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing within the biopharmaceutical sector. Additionally, perspectives as to how this can be leveraged to improve both understanding and outcomes of cell culture processes are discussed.},

  abstract = {In this paper, rapid prototyping techniques for microfluidic master mold fabrication, using copper clads micromachining and 3D printing technologies are presented. Copper clad is a promising material for microfluidic mold fabrication due to its: smooth surface, availability of different copper and dielectric layer thicknesses, affordability and easiness of machining. In addition, 3D printing technology was investigated as a rapid prototyping technique to achieve appropriate master mold fabrication. Several molds with different channel features (width and height) were fabricated from each technique and were compared from the stand point of channel resolution, minimum space between channels, surface roughness, fabrication time and cost. Finally, microfluidic chips were fabricated using those molds by using molding technique based on Poly (dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). The collection of these techniques offers precise channel heights starting from 15 {$\mu$}m and different channel width ranging from 50 {$\mu$}m in a short time fabrication process (i.e. 5min), without needing clean room equipment for molds fabrication.},

This article presents a general view of miniaturized analytical systems, covering devices giving qualitative information. Qualitative information is more than the simple identification of compounds in samples, as the modern concept of qualitative analysis also includes the analytical information not represented by numbers (as is characteristic of quantitative analysis). Thus, classification of samples by screening methods, or the definition of an analytical profile of analytes in a sample, as diagnostic tests provide, must be viewed as a type of qualitative analysis. Following this concept of qualitative analysis, different miniaturized analytical approaches are described, as are future trends, pointing out advantages, disadvantages and challenges.},

  abstract = {The detection of NOx in automotive exhaust gas is a challenge for electrochemical gas sensors. In most cases, measuring systems are unsuitable to distinguish between NO and NO2. Mixed potential sensors can theoretically determine with sufficient selectivity NO or NO2. One issue to be considered is that heterogeneous catalysis brings the NOx mixtures partly into the thermodynamic equilibrium. Therefore, the influence of this NOx conversion is investigated in this paper. For this purpose, an FE model for mixed potential sensors is used to verify whether the NOx equilibrium must be taken into account in order to simulate the sensor behavior in the measurements. It is explained how the necessary parameters for the model are quantified. It is shown that the sensor behavior can be reproduced without considering the equilibrium if NO or NO2 is dosed alone. In the NO/NO2 mixture, on the other hand, it is no longer possible for a model without NOx equilibrium to agree with the experimental data. Only when considering the heterogeneously catalyzed NOx conversion, it is possible to explain numerically the measured data with astonishing agreement. Furthermore, the resulting data set can be used for other electrode geometries without having to characterize them electrochemically again.},

In the proposed layout, electrodes are placed out of plane and the bottom electrode is a mixed interdigitated-planar plate electrode. Thanks to this layout, the sensor sensitivity is significantly enhanced. This structure has been characterized as humidity sensor manufactured by printing techniques on a flexible substrate. In particular, the sensitive layer is made of cellulose acetate butyrate deposited by screen printing, using silver ink to define the interdigitated electrodes. The capacitance is in the range of hundreds of pF with an area of 95.5 mm2 at ambient conditions. The response of this sensor shows a sensitivity substantially dependent on the frequency but this sensitivity is considered to be enough to use this device as capacitive sensor in the whole range of frequency studied, for example 5 pF/\%RH at 1 MHz. Further characterization was carried out to study the reliability of the manufacturing process and to measure the effect of temperature in the determination of the relative humidity (RH). The capacitive humidity sensor showed a thermal dependence of 0.39\%RH/K at 1 MHz.},

It consists of a combination of meandering and interdigitated electrodes in a single structure with the aim of improving the transduction sensitivity. Capacitors based on this structure, known as serpentine, have been numerically simulated, comparing their capacitance with the interdigitated electrode structure. Simulation results show a bigger capacitance in the serpentine structures than in the interdigitated ones, enhanced for increasing number of fingers. Theoretical calculations agree with results obtained from the experimental characterization of inkjet-printed serpentine and interdigitated structures used as humidity capacitive sensors. We have measured an increase of 28\% in humidity sensitivity with capacitors of the same area. Other sensor characteristics such as dynamic response, hysteresis and time drift remained unchanged for both capacitive structures. As this novel serpentine electrode structure presents a bigger geometrical capacitance factor compared to the interdigitated capacitor, in our opinion, it will be a promising base structure for multiple applications in the field of signal transduction.},

The challenges for these applications have been to reduce cost, to meet the sensitivity requirements while providing throughput and speed, and to expand the repertoire of applications. This review focuses mostly on new developments in the last 5--10 years in materials development, chip architecture and integration, different sensing modes that can be used in conjunction with microfluidics, and new applications that have emerged or have been demonstrated; it also aims to point out where future research can be directed to in these areas.},

Our approach consists in an interpretation of the differential signal produced by a pair of photodiodes connected head-to-tail due to the variations of illumination at the passage of a droplet. We checked the relevance of this zero-background method by comparing results to video measurements, and observed a very good agreement at rates up to the kHz range. Moreover, since the measured values are stored in a simple text file, flow characterization over very long times (several hours) becomes accessible. We applied this facility to perform three examples of longterm studies: stationary regimes, transient regimes, and the effect of an external forcing. Several unexpected features, like long-period fluctuations, can thus be evidenced.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, electrokinetic handling of microparticles and biological cells found many applications ranging from biomedical diagnostics to microscale assembly. The integration of electrokinetic handling such as dielectrophoresis (DEP) greatly benefits microfluidic point-of-care systems as many modern assays require cell handling. Compared to traditional pump-driven microfluidics, typically used for DEP applications, centrifugal CD microfluidics provides the ability to consolidate various liquid handling tasks in self-contained discs under the control of a single motor. Therefore, it has significant advantages in terms of cost and reliability. However, to integrate DEP on a spinning disc, a major obstacle is transferring power to the electrodes that generate DEP forces. Existing solutions for power transfer lack portability and availability or introduce excessive complexity for DEP settings. We present a concept that leverages the compatibility of DEP and inductive power transfer to bring DEP onto a rotating disc without much circuitry. Our solution leverages the ongoing advances in the printed circuit board market to make low-cost cartridges ({$<\$$}1) that can employ DEP, which was validated using yeast cells. The resulting DEPDisc platform solves the challenge that existing printed circuit board electrodes are reliant on expensive high-voltage function generators by boosting the voltage using resonant inductive power transfer. This work includes a device costing less than \$100 and easily replicable with the information provided in the Supplementary material. Consequently, with DEPDisc we present the first DEP-based low-cost platform for cell handling where both the device and the cartridges are truly inexpensive.},

  abstract = {Droplet microfluidics has enabled many recent applications in high-throughput screening and diagnostics. Little work has been done, however, to analyze the performance of droplet-based assays. This review aims to apply what is known in the literature to the analysis of the performance metrics of droplet-based assays, with specific relevance to diagnostic and biomedical applications based on two processes: enzymatic reactions and cell culture in droplets. By considering the physical scaling of individual processes---droplet generation, reaction kinetics, cell growth, and droplet interrogation---it is possible to extract a practical relationship between input parameters (e.g., droplet size and droplet polydispersity) and the output characteristics (e.g., throughput, dynamic range, and accuracy) of the assay. This review can serve as a guide to the design of droplet-based assays for achieving desired performance. While the focus is on assays based on enzymatic reactions and cell cultures, a similar analysis can be applied to other assays based on polymerase chain reaction and the detection of nucleic acids.},

Low power consumption, low sample and reagent volumes, small size, and rapid fluid transport are features of electrowetting microfluidic platforms that will enable the development of cost-effective, rapid time-to-result, and portable point-of-care diagnostic devices. Microresonator sensors are an excellent sensor technology for integration into these microfluidic systems, because they perform high sensitivity detection of proteins, DNA, and other biologically relevant molecules while tolerating a droplet oil encapsulation layer. This paper reports on a SU-8 polymer microresonator embedded in the top plate of the EWD system, which enables addressing of the sensor with a single droplet of {$<$} 100 nL in volume and enables droplets to be moved onto and off of the sensor. This system is the first to demonstrate analyte measurement by electrowetting actuation of droplets onto and off of a top plate integrated microresonator sensor. Both photolithographically patterned and electron beam lithographically patterned microresonator sensors were tested, and the effect of a conventional filler medium, silicone oil, on the sensor sensitivity was investigated.},

A Bdigital[ electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWD) microfluidics system with integrated optical sensors is a promising platform for portable POC diagnostic devices that integrate sample preparation with sensing. Herein is reported the highest sensitivity and figure of merit (FOM) microresonator sensor integrated with an EWD system to date [FOM is the product of the quality (Q) factor and the sensitivity (S)]. The EWD system embedded microresonator sensor had a measured FOM of 0:60 106 nm/RIU {\dh}Q {$\frac{1}{4}$} 8; 400; S {$\frac{1}{4}$} 72 nm/RIU{\TH} in 2-cSt silicone oil and water, which is nearly double the best FOM previously reported for an microresonator placed on top of an EWD system. Additionally, a nominal FOM of 1:2 106 nm/RIU {\dh}Q {$\frac{1}{4}$} 15 000; S {$\frac{1}{4}$} 82 nm/RIU{\TH} was measured for the vertically coupled sensor fabricated on a standard SiO2/Si substrate. This FOM is the highest reported to date for SU-8 microresonators probed at wavelengths around 1550 nm. These results indicate that high-performance polymer sensors can be integrated with low-power-consumption EWD microfluidics sample preparation systems toward the development of portable POC diagnostic devices.},

  abstract = {Potential applications of digital microfluidic (DMF) biochips now include several areas of real-life applications like environmental monitoring, water and air pollutant detection, and food processing to name a few. In order to achieve sufficiently high throughput for these applications, several instances of the same bioassay may be required to be executed concurrently on different samples. As a straightforward implementation, several identical biochips can be integrated on a single substrate as a               multichip               to execute the assay for various samples concurrently. Controlling individual electrodes of such a chip by independent pins may not be acceptable since it increases the cost of fabrication. Thus, in order to keep the overall pin-count within an acceptable bound, all the respective electrodes of these individual pieces are connected internally underneath the chip so that they can be controlled with a single external control pin. In this article, we present an orientation strategy for layout of a multichip that reduces routing congestion and consequently facilitates wire routing for the electrode array. The electrode structure of the individual pieces of the multichip may be either direct-addressable or pin-constrained. The method also supports a hierarchical approach to wire routing that ensures scalability. In this scheme, the size of the biochip in terms of the total number of electrodes may be increased by a factor of four by increasing the number of routing layers by only one. In general, for a multichip with 4                                n                              identical blocks, (               n               + 1) layers are sufficient for wire routing.},

  abstract = {A second generation Lab-on-chip device termed as digital micro fluidic biochip (DMFB) has been developed in recent years as a time multiplexed reconfigurable device capable of executing multiple bioassay protocols simultaneously on a single 2D planar array. Optical detection, processing and analysis are considered to be of major significance in bioassay operations as this may influence the conclusive decisions involving diagnosis, detection and testing. Detection results obtained from a series of tests in a single biochip --may prompt to perform next sequence of tests on separate biochips in order to converge towards specific disease profile, diagnosis and determination of the future course of treatment. In this paper we have first proposed a design of a digital detection analyzer circuit to be coupled with a biochip for execution of prescheduled multiple bioassay protocols. The analyzer enables automated detailed analysis of the optical detection results based on the data acquired at the detection site through successful Biochip operation for heterogeneous droplet samples. we further proposed a design of centralized controller that operates on the basis of the digitized output pattern obtained from the proposed analyzer for a specific test sequence and logically determines the address of the next biochip to perform the next test sequences destined in the diagnostic process flow using an intelligent database stored in the integrated system memory. The synthesis, simulation for the overall system has been carried out using precharacterized reference data for measurement of different parameters of human blood samples and corresponding final detection results are displayed and verified successfully.},

With the development of heterogeneous photonic component integration technologies it has become possible to integrate miniaturized optical sensing technologies with the Microfluidic systems. This enables complex optical detection functions to be incorporated within the microfluidic platform. In this paper we proposed a design of a digital microfluidic system that uses a feedback based detection and analysis technique using multiple homogeneous sample based detection analyzers. The analyzers are connected in a feedback loop to discrete Biochips for dedicated majority based detection on specified bioassays. The initial detection is carried out on different individual samples in a centralized digital microfluidic biochip. Based on the initial detection results for each sample feedback signals have been generated. Such signals are employed for initiatiation of independent confirmatory detection of lower degree of presence of targeted parameters on individual bioassays separately. The experiment has been carried out for Bioassays involving detection of blood Glucose, Lactate and Pyruvate. The simulation results for the design along with automated detection analysis results are found to be encouraging.},

Sample preparation and analyte identification steps in such bioassays often involve mixing for solution preparation, i.e., various fluids are to be mixed in a certain volumetric ratio in their resulting mixture. We present an efficient approach for automated mixing of three or more fluids on a dropletbased digital microfluidic biochip and design a layout for implementing this algorithm. The proposed method reduces the droplet transportation time from boundary reservoirs to onchip mixers as well as cross-contamination among overlapping droplet routing paths. Simulation of several example solutions reveals encouraging results.},

The technology aims at automation and integration of droplet based microfluidic operation within a miniaturized substrate comprised of 2D planar array of electrodes. Sample preparation remains a major issue for execution of specified bioassay protocols in DMFBs. This requires dilution of samples or formation of mixtures with different targeted concentration factors. Here, we propose new techniques for sample preparation with single source, multiple target concentration having linear dilution gradient for prespecified bioassay execution. The main objective is to i) minimize number of samples as well as reagents for obtaining targeted concentration ii) to employ minimum mixing or dilution operations and thereby optimizing the module utilization and iii) to obtain multiple copies of targeted concentration necessary for fault tolerance and parallel bioassay applications and iv) minimum generation of waste droplets to ensure optimum sample and module utilization.},

In recent years a new generation of such lab on chip devices namely Digital Microfluidic Biochip is emerged as a suitable application for concurrent and scalable integration of multiple bioassay protocols. Dependability and accuracy are major issues for safety critical applications of DMFBs specifically in the areas of clinical diagnostics and other biochemical applications. Functional testing is targeted towards assessment of reliability of basic microfluidic operations namely merging, mixing, splitting and incubation. In this paper we proposed a layout specific functional testing method that detects faults in a prespecified group of cells already placed within a 2D array for execution of a given bioassay protocol. The objective is to minimize the test completion time, optimize test resources and customize the test for prespecified cluster of cells to be utilized as modules dedicated for microfluidic operations. The simulation is carried out on testbenches of Benchmark suite III and the results are found to be encouraging.},

This paper deals with a challenging problem related to the design of DMFB. Specifically the design problem considered is related to high performance droplet routing, where each droplet has single source location and single target location. The objectives are (i) minimizing the number of electrodes used in the DMFB, and (ii) minimizing the total routing time of all the droplets or arrival time of a droplet that is the last to arrive at its target(latest arrival time). We propose a simple algorithm for concurrent path allocation to multiple droplets, based on the Soukup's routing algorithm [22] , together with the use of stalling, and possible detouring of droplets in cases of contentions. Selection of the droplets is based on their respective source to target Manhattan paths. The empirical results are quite encouraging.},

A promising category of LoCs is digital microfluidic (DMF)-based biochips, in which nanoliter-volume fluid droplets are manipulated on a 2-D electrode array. A key challenge in designing such chips and mapping lab-bench protocols to a LoC is to carry out the dilution process of biochemical samples efficiently. As an optimization and automation technique, we present a dilution/mixing algorithm that significantly reduces the production of waste droplets.

However, the new generation of miniaturized biosensor technologies aimed at POC testing resulted in a more sensitive, reliable, rapid and cost-effective detection process without needing sophisticated instruments. Among them, a few were developed as ready-to-use devices and are currently commercially available. In this review, we presented the most recent developments in diagnostic methods in pathogen detection and the improvements included in the detection steps in recent POCs for pathogen detection.

A digital microfluidic system typically consists of a planar array of cells with electrodes that control individual droplets of biological samples. Chemical analysis is performed by moving, mixing, and splitting of droplets. A major issue in biochip layout design is the coordination of simultaneous movement of multiple droplets. It involves the scheduling of movement of a number of droplets in a time-multiplexed manner to avoid their cross-contamination. In this paper we propose a clustering technique to achieve routing of maximum number of samples from a given set of sub-problems in the same planar array with intelligent collision avoidance. A new cluster-based route-aware placement technique is also proposed that enhances the performance of droplet routing, accommodating larger number of concurrently routed sub-problems in the same planar array. The objectives considered are minimizing the latest arrival time of droplets, total routing time of droplets and the overall cell utilization. Experimental simulation results obtained using testbenches for benchmark suite III are found to be better than the recent existing works.},

  abstract = {Digital-WGS enables high-performance single-cell sequencing with automatic processing based on digital microfluidics.           ,              Single-cell whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is critical for characterizing dynamic intercellular changes in DNA. Current sample preparation technologies for single-cell WGS are complex, expensive, and suffer from high amplification bias and errors. Here, we describe Digital-WGS, a sample preparation platform that streamlines high-performance single-cell WGS with automatic processing based on digital microfluidics. Using the method, we provide high single-cell capture efficiency for any amount and types of cells by a wetted hydrodynamic structure. The digital control of droplets in a closed hydrophobic interface enables the complete removal of exogenous DNA, sufficient cell lysis, and lossless amplicon recovery, achieving the low coefficient of variation and high coverage at multiple scales. The single-cell genomic variations profiling performs the excellent detection of copy number variants with the smallest bin of 150 kb and single-nucleotide variants with allele dropout rate of 5.2\%, holding great promise for broader applications of single-cell genomics.},

Therefore, a sensitive and accurate method for DNA methylation detection is highly desirable for the discovery and diagnostics of human diseases, especially cancers. Here, an integrated, low-cost, and portable point-of-care (POC) device is presented to analyze DNA methylation, which integrates the process of pyrosequencing in a digital microfluidic chip. Without additional equipment and complicated operation, droplets are manipulated by patterned electrodes with individually programmed control. The system exhibited an excellent sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) of 10 pg and a comparable checkout down to 5\% methylation level within 30 min, which offered a potential substitute for the detection of DNA methylation. With the advantages of portability, ease of use, high accuracy, and low cost, the POC platform shows great potential for the analysis of tumorspecific circulating DNA.},

For enhanced sensitivity of the sensor, the working electrode is modified through the electrochemical method, namely by reducing graphene with voltammetry and coating gold nanoparticles by amperometry. Detachable sensor and absorber modules are assembled modularly on an open chip plate, forming various novel hybridized open--closed chip formats. By varying the coupled or decoupled sensor modules, excellent detection of three diagnostic biological molecules is demonstrated (glucose, dopamine, and uric acid in human serum). With a newly designed portable power supply and wireless control system, the active paper-based chip platform can be utilized as an advanced point-of-care device for multiple assays in digital microfluidics.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidics is an elegant technique based on single droplets for the design, composition, and manipulation of microfluidic systems. In digital microfluidics, especially in the electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) system, each droplet acts as an independent reactor, which enables a wide range of multiple parallel biological and chemical reactions at the microscale. EWOD digital microfluidics reduces reagent and energy consumption, accelerates analysis, enables point-of-care diagnostic, simplifies integration with sensors, etc. Such a digital microfluidic system is especially relevant for droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), thanks to its nanoliter droplets and well-controlled volume distribution. At low DNA concentration, these small volumes allow less than one DNA strand per droplet on average (limited dilution) so that after a fixed number of PCR cycles (endpoint PCR), only the DNA in droplets containing the sequence of interest has been amplified and can be detected by fluorescence to yield an accurate count of the sequences of interest using statistical models. Focusing on ddPCR, this article summarizes the latest development and research on EWOD technology for droplet PCR over the last decade.},

  abstract = {Liquid biopsy is emerging as a potential diagnostic tool for prostate cancer (PC) prognosis and diagnosis. Unfortunately, most circulating tumor cells (CTC) technologies, such as AdnaTest or Cellsearch{\textregistered}, critically rely on the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) marker, limiting the possibility of detecting cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) and mesenchymal-like cells (EMT-CTCs) that are present during PC progression. In this context, dielectrophoresis (DEP) is an epCAM independent, label-free enrichment system that separates rare cells simply on the basis of their specific electrical properties. As compared to other technologies, DEP may represent a superior technique in terms of running costs, cell yield and specificity. However, because of its higher complexity, it still requires further technical as well as clinical development. DEP can be improved by the use of microfluid, nanostructured materials and fluoro-imaging to increase its potential applications. In the context of cancer, the usefulness of DEP lies in its capacity to detect CTCs in the bloodstream in their epithelial, mesenchymal, or epithelial--mesenchymal phenotype forms, which should be taken into account when choosing CTC enrichment and analysis methods for PC prognosis and diagnosis.},

This method enables manipulation of droplets several times smaller than the electrode size and, importantly, minimizes evaporation, contamination, and exposure of the sample to high voltages. We demonstrate various modes of droplet loading, transporting, and unloading. Using advanced imaging processing techniques, we obtained detailed information about the shuttle and droplet centroids. Furthermore, varying water concentration on the soft shuttle allows for modulation of the diffusion kinetics of samples into the shuttle, which also can be controlled with soft shuttle actuation velocity. We believe that this novel approach for the manipulation of droplets will advance the field of droplet-based open microfluidics and can be potentially useful for applications in biotechnology, diagnostics, or analytical chemistry.},

  abstract = {Microfluidic droplets of various sizes are applied in a broad spectrum of biological and chemical processes and require high uniformity for reliable outcomes. Although various droplet detection methods have been employed to achieve monodisperse droplets, the capacitive method stands out for its ease of use and rapid response, enabling real-time feedback control. However, this method has limitations in terms of significantly altering the droplet size, resulting in increased continuous phase consumption and the need for microchannel and sensing component replacements. In response, we present the Sensing Area-Variable Electrode (SAVE), which is designed to produce monodisperse droplets across a broad size range without excessive continuous phase consumption and without requiring the frequent replacement of sensing components. The experimental results demonstrate that using the SAVE electrode enables the generation of monodisperse 0.2, 0.4, and 1.0 nL droplets by simply replacing the disposable microchannel while reusing the sensing components. Moreover, the adaptable number of droplets achieved by microchannel replacement allows the SAVE electrode to be effectively utilized in droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) assays, providing a balance between sensitivity and throughput. Consequently, the SAVE electrode addresses the limitations of the capacitive detection method and offers a versatile solution for various droplet-based biological and chemical processes, including ddPCR assays.},

This way, the particles in the fluid within non-uniform electric field experience the dielectrophoresis force. The amount and direction of this force depend on the fluid and particle polarization, particle size and electric field gradient. In this paper after presenting governing equations concerning the dielectrophoresis phenomenon, a microfluidic actuator introduced in which an interdigitated electrode pattern is applied in. Voltage, pitch, and width to pitch ratio of electrode as well as channel height are of the most important geometrical parameters of this actuator whose individual effect on particles separation was investigated using finite element analysis (FEM). The simulation results showed that if the actuator is intended to work in the efficient conditions, channel height and electrodes pitch should be near to each other, height needs to be as minimum as possible while voltage as maximum as possible in order to reach to the least time duration and the highest quantity for particles separation. Then, using theoretical equations and simulation results, a flowchart is introduced to design and optimize dielectrophoresis separation actuators. Finally, experimental results for k562 cell separation, as a biological particle, from Polystyrene, as a standard particle, is presented. In the fabricated actuator recovery and purity efficiency are 93\% and about 100\% respectively.},

Adding only a single series resistor to existing AC droplet actuation circuits, the platform is simple to implement and has negligible effect on actuation voltage. To accurately measure the complex voltage across the resistor (and hence current through the device and droplet), the designed system is based on software-implemented lock-in amplification detection of the voltage drop across the resistor which filters out noise, enabling high-resolution and low-limit signal recovery. We observe picoliter sensitivity with linear correlation of voltage to volume extending to the microliter volumes that can be handled by digital microfluidic devices. Due to the minimal hardware, the system is robust and measurements are highly repeatable. The detection technique provides both phase and magnitude information of the real-time current flowing through the droplet for a full impedance measurement. The sensitivity and resolution of this platform enables it to distinguish between various liquids which, as demonstrated in this paper, could potentially be extended to quantify solute concentrations, liquid mixtures, and presence of analytes.},

  abstract = {A method is presented for measurements of secondary acoustic radiation forces acting on solid particles in a plain ultrasonic standing wave. The method allows for measurements of acoustic interaction forces between particles located in arbitrary positions such as in between a pressure node and a pressure antinode. By utilizing a model that considers both density- and compressibility-dependent effects, the observed particle-particle interaction dynamics can be well understood. Two differently sized polystyrene micro-particles (4.8 and 25\,{$\mu$}m, respectively) were used in order to achieve pronounced interaction effects. The particulate was subjected to a 2-MHz ultrasonic standing wave in a microfluidic channel, such as commonly used for acoustophoresis. Observation of deflections in the particle pathways shows that the particle interaction force is not negligible under this circumstance and has to be considered in accurate particle manipulation applications. The effect is primarily pronounced when the distance between two particles is small, the sizes of the particles are different, and the acoustic properties of the particles are different relative to the media. As predicted by theory, the authors also observe that the interaction forces are affected by the angle between the inter-particle centerline and the axis of the standing wave propagation direction.},

  abstract = {The thermocapillary instability of irradiated transparent liquid films on absorbing solid substrates is investigated by means of linear stability analysis. Under such circumstances, incident light passes through a film and is absorbed by the substrate, and the film is then heated by the heat influx across the interface with the substrate. The optical absorption in the substrate is affected by optical reflection. The energy reflectance varies periodically with the film thickness due to optical interference between light waves reflected from the gas-liquid and liquid-solid interfaces. The periodic variation of the reflectance strongly affects the film stability, which also varies periodically with the film thickness. Characteristic scales of the instability are also affected by the substrate thickness and incident light intensity. While qualitative aspects of the stability can be easily obtained from the analysis based on a simplified model that is derived under the thin-substrate assumption, the quantitative evaluation for the case of substrates of moderate to large thickness should be based on a more generalized model that allows for substrates of arbitrary thickness.},

In this study, a numerical simulation methodology that couples electro-mechanic, solid, and acoustic domains in 3D has been developed for acoustofluidic chips. Numerical investigation of design and operation parameters' effects were performed in terms of performance metrics. The simulation model was used for further analysis to understand the effects of manufacturing and assembly errors on acoustophoretic performance. The combined effect of chip dimensions on particle separation was investigated using the Monte Carlo approach. Acoustophoretic chips made of silicon, glass, and acrylic were fabricated and compared in terms of microparticle focusing performance. Even though the acrylic chip is more tolerant to the dimensional and manufacturing variations, silicon and glass based chips were able to focus the microparticles better than the acrylic chip.},

The intrinsic ability of the calixarene to capture ammonium was studied in the conductometric measuring mode and by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The developed sensor showed high selectivity to ammonium in the presence of mono-, di-, and trivalent cations. Selective and highly sensitive detection of ammonium resulted from the complexation between the ammonium ions and a crown-ether fragment of the upper rim of the 25,27-di-(5-thio-octyloxy)calix[4]arene-crown-6 macrocycle. The developed sensor had high signal repeatability. Its sensitivity was found to be satisfactory for the forthcoming sensor application in the water-sample analysis; the linear range was 0.01--1.5 mM and limit of detection 10 {$\mu$}M.},

By employing the unique characteristics of microscale flow phenomena, various techniques have been established for fast and accurate separation and sorting of microparticles in a continuous manner. The advancements in microfluidics enable sorting technologies that combine the benefits of continuous operation with small-sized scale suitable for manipulation and probing of individual particles or cells. Microfluidic sorting platforms require smaller sample volume, which has several benefits in terms of reduced cost of reagents, analysis time and less invasiveness to patients for sample extraction. Additionally, smaller size of device together with lower fabrication cost allows massive parallelization, which makes high-throughput sorting possible. Both passive and active separation and sorting techniques have been reported in literature. Passive techniques utilize the interaction between particles, flow field and the channel structure and do not require external fields. On the other hand, active techniques make use of external fields in various forms but offer better performance. This paper provides an extensive review of various passive and active separation techniques including basic theories and experimental details. The working principles are explained in detail, and performances of the devices are discussed.},

In order to understand the sensing properties, the printed sensors with pristine CuO and rGO-CuO composite were subjected to concentration, temperature and time dependent ammonia sensing measurements. The rGO-CuO nanocomposite sensor showed an enhanced sensor response of 13 at room temperature (30 {$^\circ$}C) and 30 at 300 {$^\circ$}C, respectively which is a 10-fold increase as compared to pristine CuO based device. The selectivity experiments were carried out by exposing the sensor to ethanol, methanol, acetone and ammonia. The sensor showed highest response towards ammonia in comparison with other test gases. The observed sensing performance suggest the applicability of the present sensors to room temperature and elevated temperature operations.},

Despite significant clinical and biomedical applications for digital protein detection, the development of miniaturized Simoa systems has been limited by the requirements for use of large sample volumes ({$\sim$}100 {$\mu$}L) and low numbers of beads ({$\sim$}5000) for high sensitivity tests. To address these challenges, we improved the integration of DMF with Simoa-based assays by developing strategies for loading mixtures of sample and beads into DMF networks using methods relying on either virtual channels or small liquid segments that were applied either in parallel or in a stepwise manner. We have also demonstrated a dedicated densifying electrode technique that captures low numbers of beads within a droplet, allowing high bead retention with minimal residual volumes of liquid. Based on these improvements, we optimized the front-end assay processing of beads using DMF and demonstrated a method to detect tumor necrosis factor {$\alpha$} (TNF-{$\alpha$}) by Simoa that showed equivalent performance to a microtitre plate assay. The new strategies described here form a step toward integrating DMF and Simoa for a wide range of applications.},

The fabrication process for the electrode and the device development includes laser exposure, wet developing, etching, and stripping. A dielectric layer of 5\% (wt. /wt.) Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) is used for the electrode insulation. In addition, a very thin (50 nm) layer of Teflon is coated on the EWOD surface to provide hydrophobicity. It is observed that a thin and high dielectric-constant layer can reduce the actuation voltage in the EWOD device. An actuation voltage of 14.8 V was achieved by the EWOD device.},

  abstract = {The use of acoustic energy to manipulate particles and cells (acoustophoresis) is a well-studied and popular technique in microfluidic microscopy applications. This powerful and gentle method has typically required the construction of costly and labour intensive resonating chambers. A new fabrication method for acoustophoretic resonators is presented, using inexpensive materials and without the need for cleanrooms or the special equipment typically found within them. By utilizing a simple glass and polyimide sandwiching technique, single, bifurcating, and trifurcating microchannels were built and tested. Various half and full wavelength transversal resonators were established in microchannel widths of 300, 600, and 750 {\textmu}m using 1, 2.5, and 5 MHz ultrasound. In significantly simplifying the fabrication and prototyping of these microfluidic resonators we hope to address some of the major drawbacks preventing acoustophoresis technology from being incorporated into the toolkits of laboratories around the world.},

  abstract = {Several studies have been performed on the integration of biosensors into digital microfluidics (DMF). Despite the general success in their detection capabilities, there are still two challenges associated with the integration of biosensors into DMF: (1) complete removal of the droplet containing the analytes from the sensing surface; and (2) biochemical regeneration of the biosensor involving detaching the target analyte from the receptor after each round of sensing. The latter is case dependent and the solution can vary from one application to another. Our research aims at addressing the former, the solution to which is applicable to all biosensors integrated to DMF. This paper presents a thorough characterization of the hydrophilic surface of the biosensor in terms of wettability and geometry, taking into account the overall configuration of the DMF platform. Consequently, we identify the optimal geometry of the sensing surface and the DMF platform providing successful removal of the target droplet from the sensing surface after detection. Based on the results, the gap height is suggested to be chosen at the upper limit of the applicable range. Also, the biosensor, patterned on the device top plate, is recommended to be designed with a high aspect ratio and aligned with the center of the actuating electrode. As a proof of concept, the optimum configuration is implemented on a DMF platform with an interdigitated capacitive biosensor to detect different concentrations of Cryptosporidium, for which it is shown that the sample droplet is removed successfully from the superhydrophilic surface of the biosensor.},

A great deal of effort has been devoted to improve and advance these devices with the goal of performing complete sets of biochemical assays on the device and possibly developing portable platforms for point of care applications. Among the different microfluidic systems used for such a purpose, digital microfluidics (DMF) shows high flexibility and capability of performing multiplex and parallel biochemical operations, and hence, has been considered as a suitable candidate for lab-on-a-chip applications. In this review, we discuss the most recent advances in the DMF platforms, and evaluate the feasibility of developing multifunctional packages for performing complete sets of processes of biochemical assays, particularly for point-of-care applications. The progress in the development of DMF systems is reviewed from eight different aspects, including device fabrication, basic fluidic operations, automation, manipulation of biological samples, advanced operations, detection, biological applications, and finally, packaging and portability of the DMF devices. Success in developing the lab-on-a-chip DMF devices will be concluded based on the advances achieved in each of these aspects.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the thorough analysis of a new operator developed for unequal droplet splitting by geometrical modification of a conventional electrode in digital microfluidic (DMF) platforms. This operator functions in an area as small as the size of a conventional electrode divided into several smaller sub-electrodes addressable independently. Using this operator, droplets can be precisely split unequally with a high volume ratio, as well as being dispensed with a wide range of sizes from a reservoir. This operator functions without complications in the fabrication process and the need for additional external modules such as feedback control systems. To characterize the range of the applicability of this operator, the effects of the applied voltage, the gap height between the two plates, and the sub-electrode geometry on the splitting performance are studied. For high applied voltages, splitting is performed with an error close to 5\% (similar to the splitting precision obtained in conventional DMF devices); whereas, for voltages close to the threshold value, the error is less than 1\%. In this way the droplet size becomes fairly independent of the geometry and the gap height. The threshold splitting voltage versus gap height has also been studied and shows a linear behavior, facilitating the selection of proper voltages for high precision splitting. For the three subelectrode patterns studied here (i.e. square, horizontal stripe, and vertical stripe), the results show that the square sub-electrodes provide higher reliability and a wider range of sizes for the split droplet as compared to the other patterns. The final part of the study illustrates that there is a linear relation between the area of the split droplets and the number of actuated sub-electrodes. This linear behavior allows for the selection of an appropriate number of the sub-electrodes to be actuated based on the desired volume of the droplet.},

Soft materials such as gelatin and gelatin-based hydrogels have grown in popularity for use in a wide variety of applications including tissue engineering, biofabrication, and organ transplantation. With hydrogel structures being used in such demanding applications, it is crucial to properly characterize the dynamic behavior of these soft structures. Although there have been major improvements in measurement technology for determining the mechanical properties of soft, translucent materials, it remains quite challenging to reliably measure the Young's and shear moduli of these materials in a way that remains straightforward, low-cost, and non-contact. This research aims to address the weaknesses in modern measurement methods and develop a system suitable for characterizing the elastic moduli of soft materials that requires only four, inexpensive, off-the-shelf components. Utilizing a Raspberry Pi, stepping motor, and an inexpensive camera, the Young's and shear moduli of a gelatin column is measured five times. The standard deviation between measurement was observed to be less than 0.15\% with high accuracy having an error of less than 4.6\% when compared to relatively expensive, conventional measurement techniques.},

Engineers face significant challenges during the labor-intensive process of designing microfluidic devices, with very few specialized tools that help automate the process. Typical design iterations require the engineer to research the architecture, manually draft the device layout, optimize for manufacturing processes, and manually calculate and program the valve sequences that operate the microfluidic device.

  abstract = {Non-standard diesel blends can be harmful to the environment and human health. In this context, a simple analytical method to estimate the biodiesel mixture ratio in diesel was developed based on impedance spectroscopy (IS) associated with interdigitated sensors. In this article, four different interdigitated sensors with varied comb spacing (G) were simulated using the COMSOL Multiphysics software. Based on finite element simulations, four interdigitated electrode architectures were manufactured and evaluated. The best geometry was chosen according to theoretical data simulations, and its interdigitated electrodes were manufactured for the compositional evaluation of pseudo-binary biodiesel--diesel mixtures. According to the X-ray powder diffraction technique, the deposition of the conductive layer (Au0) over the surface of the dielectric substrate (SiO2) did not alter its phase composition. In the analysis of AFM and SEM, it was possible to observe irregular edges on the electrodes, possibly related to the manufacturing process of the thin layers and mechanical stability. Another characteristic observed in the AFM images was the height of the step of the gold layer of the sensor. Several cross sections were obtained, and the mean step value was 225.71 {\textpm} 0.0032 nm. Although there were differences in the roughness, the whole sensor had nanometric roughness. Based on the finite element method simulation performed, it can be assumed that the geometric parameters more suitable for the manufacturing of the electrode are W = 20 {\textmu}m, L = 1000 {\textmu}m, G = 50 {\textmu}m, and N = 40 digits. The electrical characterization performed by impedance spectroscopy showed that we could differentiate between biodiesel and diesel fuels and their pseudo-binary mixtures in the low-frequency region.},

The molecular structure of Cu-MOF was authenticated by single crystal x-ray studies. The prepared materials have been probed by various physicochemical characterization techniques. Due to the positive synergistic effects between Cu-MOF crystals and rGO nanosheets, the newly synthesized Cu-MOF/rGO hybrid delivers high charge storage efficiency (685.33 F g-1 at 1.6 A g-1), high energy (137.066 Wh kg-1) and power density (4800.04 W kg-1) and with excellent rate ability (retains 71.01\% of its initial capacitance at 8 A g-1). Furthermore, the long cycle life (91.91\% after 1000 cycles) of this hybrid indicates its high stability on the electrode surface. Additionally, the electrode modified with Cu-MOF/rGO hybrid performs exceptionally towards the electrochemical detection of nitrite in a wide dynamic linear range of 3-40000 {\textmu}M (R2=0.99911), with a notable detection limit of 33 nm and high sensitivity of 43.736 {\textmu}A{\textmu}M-1 cm-2. The versatility of Cu-MOF/rGO modified electrode can be observed by distinguished selectivity in the presence of some common interfering species and also ability to detect nitrite in the real samples.},

Industry uses wet scrubber technology as air pollution control from emitted odor from drying process. Preliminary identification in noncontrolled wet scrubber shown that wet scrubber efficiency around 47\%. Low efficiency wet scrubbing process causes rain drop of water vapor around drying process. This research used electrochemical based sensor MICS 5524 as ammonia monitoring instrument, assisted with arduino as microcontroller to regulate water discharge through valve controlling scrubbing process. This electrochemical based sensor reads ammonia based on voltage reads by Arduino microcontroller. Ammonia reading then control scrubbing process by adjusting valve opening for spray water distribution. Wet scrubber efficiency increases to 66,96\% due to water scrubbing control, also can save water utilization as high as 61,90\%, followed by absence of rain drop contains ammonia around drying process area.},

  abstract = {The integration of Raspberry Pi miniature computer systems with microfluidics has revolutionised the development of low-cost and customizable analytical systems in life science laboratories. This review explores the applications of Raspberry Pi in microfluidics, with a focus on imaging, including microscopy and automated image capture. By leveraging the low cost, flexibility and accessibility of Raspberry Pi components, high-resolution imaging and analysis have been achieved in direct mammalian and bacterial cellular imaging and a plethora of image-based biochemical and molecular assays, from immunoassays, through microbial growth, to nucleic acid methods such as real-time-qPCR. The control of image capture permitted by Raspberry Pi hardware can also be combined with onboard image analysis. Open-source hardware offers an opportunity to develop complex laboratory instrumentation systems at a fraction of the cost of commercial equipment and, importantly, offers an opportunity for complete customisation to meet the users' needs. However, these benefits come with a trade-off: challenges remain for those wishing to incorporate open-source hardware equipment in their own work, including requirements for construction and operator skill, the need for good documentation and the availability of rapid prototyping such as 3D printing plus other components. These advances in open-source hardware have the potential to improve the efficiency, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness of microfluidic-based experiments and applications.},

  abstract = {The 20th century has seen tremendous innovation of dielectrophoretic (DEP) technologies, with applications being developed in areas ranging from industrial processing to micro and nanoscale biotechnology. From 2010 to present day there have been 981 publications about DEP. Of 2600 total patents held by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, 106 were filed in 2019 alone. This review focuses on DEP-based technologies and application developments between 2010 and 2020, with an aim to highlight the progress and to identify potential areas for future research. A major trend over the last ten years has been the use of DEP techniques for biological and clinical applications. It has been used in various forms on a diverse array of biologically derived molecules and particles to manipulate and study them including proteins, exosomes, bacteria, yeast, stem cells, cancer cells, and blood cells. DEP has also been used to manipulate nano and micron sized particles in order to fabricate different structures. The next ten years are likely to see the increase in DEP related patent applications begin to result in a greater level of technology commercialization. Also during this time, innovations in DEP technology will likely be leveraged to continue the existing trend to further biological and medical focused applications as well as applications in microfabrication. As a tool leveraged by engineering and imaginative scientific design, DEP offers unique capabilities to manipulate small particles in precise ways that can help solve problems and enable scientific inquiry that cannot be addressed using conventional methods.},

Hence the opposite walls of comb electrodes in the overlapping region form a parallel plate capacitor and contribute a capacitance C easily analyzed with fringe capacitance can be estimated to analytically difficult one. However, the nearly accurate way to estimate for the fringe capacitance is by using the finite element method (FEM). The major importance of the geometric dimensions on interdigitated electrode sensors are studied with an analytical model.

The on-chip IMERs consist of porous polymer (thiol-ene) monolith plugs prepared in situ by photopolymerization and functionalized with recombinant CYP1A1 isoforms (an important detoxification route for many drugs and other xenobiotics). The DMF devices also incorporate inexpensive, inkjet-printed microheaters for on-demand regio-specific heating of the IMERs to physiological temperature, which is crucial for maintaining the activity of the temperature-sensitive CYP reaction. For on-chip monitoring of the CYP activity, the DMF devices were combined with a commercial well-plate reader, and a custom fluorescence quantification method was developed for detection of the chosen CYP1A1 model activity (ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylation). The reproducibility of the developed assay was examined with the help of ten parallel CYP-IMERs. All CYP-IMERs provided statistically significant difference (in fluorescence response) compared to any of the negative controls (including room-temperature reactions). The average (n = 10) turnover rate was 20.3 {\textpm} 9.0 fmol resorufin per minute. Via parallelization, the concept of the droplet-based CYP-IMER developed in this study provides a viable approach to rapid and low-cost prediction of the metabolic clearance of new chemical entities in vitro.},

We developed a centrifugal microfluidic automatic wireless endpoint detection system integrated with loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for monoplex pathogen detection. Six identical sets were designed on the microfluidic compact disc (CD) to perform 30 genetic analyses of three different species of foodborne pathogens. The consecutive loading, mixing, and aliquoting of the LAMP primers/reagents and DNA sample solutions were accomplished using an optimized square-wave microchannel, metering chambers and revulsion per minute (RPM) control. We tested 24 strains of pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp and Vibrio cholerae), with 8 strains of each bacterium, and performed DNA amplification on the microfluidic CD for 60 min. Then, the amplicons of the LAMP reaction were detected using the calcein colorimetric method and further analysed via the developed electronic system interfaced with Bluetooth wireless technology to transmit the results to a smartphone. The system showed a limit of detection (LOD) of 3 {\texttimes} 10-5 ng {$\mu$}L-1 DNA by analysing the colour change when tested with chicken meat spiked with the three pathogenic bacteria. Since the entire process was performed in a fully automated way and was easy to use, our microdevice is suitable for point-of-care (POC) testing with high simplicity, providing affordability and accessibility even to poor, resource-limited settings.},

  abstract = {Salmonellosis is one of the most common foodborne diseases caused by the genus Salmonella and is considered to be a significant global health concern. Therefore, the development of effective techniques for rapidly detecting Salmonella is fundamental in preventing foodborne outbreaks. This paper presents a lab-on-a-disc integrated loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) on a microfluidic platform for Salmonella detection. We have developed a centrifugal microfluidic platform device in which the main steps in pathogen detection, reagent preparation, LAMP, and detection can be integrated onto a single microfluidic compact disc (CD). A forced convection heating source was used for wax valve actuation and temperature heating for the LAMP amplification, leading toward compactness and system miniaturization. The detection limit was 5 {\texttimes} 10-3 ng/ L DNA concentration when tested on tomatoes spiked with Salmonella. The whole procedure, from sample preparation (on the microfluidic CD) up to detection, was completed within 70 min using a fully automated process. The final detection step was performed via direct visual observation of the color change of the SYBR Green I dye. Our system offers a fast and automated molecular diagnostic platform, thereby reducing the need for skillful operators and expensive instrumentation. This developed portable device would have a wide range of potential biomedical applications, including foodborne pathogen detection and molecular diagnostics in developing countries. {\copyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Abstract                            The integration of smartphones and microfluidics is nowadays the best possible route to achieve effective point-of-need testing (PONT), a concept increasingly demanded in the fields of human health, agriculture, food safety, and environmental monitoring. Nevertheless, efforts are still required to integrally seize all the advantages of smartphones, as well as to share the developments in easily adoptable formats. For this purpose, here we present the free platform               appuente               ~that was designed for the easy integration of microfluidic chips, smartphones, and the cloud. It includes a mobile app for end users, which provides chip identification and tracking, guidance and control, processing, smart-imaging, result reporting and cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) integration. The platform also includes a web app for PONT developers, to easily customize their mobile apps and manage the data of administered tests. Three application examples were used to validate               appuente               : a dummy grayscale detector that mimics quantitative colorimetric tests, a root elongation assay for pesticide toxicity assessment, and a lateral flow immunoassay for leptospirosis detection. The platform openly offers fast prototyping of smartphone apps to the wide community of lab-on-a-chip developers, and also serves as a friendly framework for new techniques, IoT integration and further capabilities. Exploiting these advantages will certainly help to enlarge the use of PONT with real-time connectivity in the near future.},

For particle laden droplets, the change in both resistance and capacitance was found to be linear from zero to five-hundred particles with a resolution of approximately six particles for both measurements. Electrical properties were also measured for mixtures of alkaline phosphatase and pNitrophenyl Phosphate; reagents commonly used in immunoassays as the resultant chemical reaction produces a yellow precipitate. Experiments were performed with mixtures created off-chip and in droplet that were statically mixed on chip. The difference between the measured and expected capacitance was found to increase with the concentration of alkaline phosphatase and chemical reactions could be positively identified in mixtures made both on and off the chip. Real-time measurements of reagents mixed in a four electrode electrowetting on dielectric mixer were also taken. In these experiments, chemical equilibrium was reached after approximately 20 cycles and the difference between the measured and expected capacitance was over 8.5 times greater than the experimental uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Discrete flow microfluidic devices have been identified as a technology that can be used to efficiently deliver health care services by reducing the cycle times and reagent consumption of common biological protocols and medical diagnostic procedures while reducing overhead costs by performing these applications at the point of care. Electrowetting on dielectric is one promising discrete flow microfluidic platform that can individually create, manipulate, and mix droplets through the application of asymmetric electric fields. The work presented outlines fundamental and practical contributions to the understanding and advancement of electrowetting on dielectric devices that the authors are using to develop a device capable of performing immunoassays on chip. Explicit analytical models for capillary force and the reduction in that force by contact angle hysteresis as a function of the three-dimensional shape of the droplet were derived to develop an empirically validated analytical model for transient motion of droplets in electrowetting on dielectric devices. This model accurately predicts the maximum droplet displacement and travel time to within 2.3\% and 2.7\%, respectively; whereas the average droplet velocity was always predicted to within 8.1\%. It also demonstrates a method for real time monitoring of droplet composition, particle concentration, and chemical reactions in electrowetting on dielectric devices without optical access. This method has been used to determine the concentration of watermethanol solutions, measure the concentration of glass microspheres at various concentrations, and detect the chemical reactions that are typically used in immunoassays. A method for the mechanical filtration of droplets in these devices will also be presented. The proposed filtration method was successful at pore sizes at least two orders of magnitude below the droplet height, which is small enough to separate red and white blood cells in continuous flow microfluidic devices.},

  abstract = {The use of capacitance measurements to identify the composition of droplets and monitor mixing in electrowetting on dielectric devices is examined here. Measurements were repeatable at each addressable location, with standard deviations on the order of 0.1 pF and a two-point calibration allowed repeatable differentiation of water--methanol solutions as the capacitance was linear with concentration. Capacitance at addressable locations was monitored throughout the mixing of water--methanol solutions. It was shown analytically and experimentally that the dimensionless capacitance is approximately equal to the dimensionless dielectric constant for practical EWOD applications. The number of cycles required for complete mixing remained constant for periods of actuation between 400 and 1000 ms and applied voltages between 90 and 110 VRMS. Although minimizing actuation period and maximizing droplet velocity decreases mixing time, these parameters have little affect on the number of cycles necessary to achieve mixing in EWOD devices. This shows mixing efficiency in EWOD devices is better described by the number of cycles, not the time, required for full mixing.},

  abstract = {Article Info Water disruption has always been a major issue in Malaysia. The reason for the frequent water disruption is due to the shutdown of water treatment plant (WTP) for unable to process contaminated raw water from the river. In wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), main source of ammonia is from the breakdown of proteins and amino acids in organic waste. Typically, ammonia is not fully removed from the WWTP and most of the ammonia is being discharged together with the plant effluent into the river streams. High levels of ammonia in the water exerts an oxygen demand which causes oxygen depletion. Hence, affecting the aquatic ecosystem and creates a toxic environment for the aquatic life. Biological treatment is known to be the most cost saving method as it only constructs of simple components, chemical free treatment and producing no harm by-products which later cause cost increment for additional treatment. Furthermore, biological treatment is capable in producing high quality treated drinking water that meets the standard water guidelines and regulations. In this paper, the aim is to conduct an overview on the application of biological treatment as an alternative treatment method of ammonia removal in water and wastewater treatment plant. This overview presents the cohesive approach of biological treatment in water and wastewater treatment plant, source of ammonia pollution, standard implies on ammonia concentration to control potential hazards, reported cases and recent pollution status of ammonia globally. In addition, the use of an artificial intelligence for model prediction and control strategies for water treatment have been included in this overview.},

This paper reports the development of DMF devices using low-cost materials and simple deposition techniques specifically for the device dielectric component. Three commercial polyurethane coatings were investigated for their feasibility as the dielectric layer. The electrowetting behaviour of these materials was investigated by evaluating the change in contact angle with applied voltage of a water droplet sitting on the dielectric samples prepared using easy deposition methods such as spraying and spin coating. Devices were then fabricated using these materials to evaluate their capability to actuate droplets. Five types of polyurethane dielectric sample exhibited contact angle reversibility with hysteresis ranging between 4{$^\circ$} to 25{$^\circ$} after 250 VDC application. Droplet transportation back and forth across 8 electrodes at 180 VRMS has been demonstrated in a device made of one of the polyurethane coatings using a spraying technique. This result implies the potential of using polyurethane for future development of low-cost and disposable DMF devices.},

However, fluid behavior undergoes significant changes as geometric scale decreases. The laminar flow behavior of fluids in microfluidic devices must be accommodated in the design and development of clinical and bio-clinical miniaturized systems. Conclusion: The scale of chemical and clinical analysis systems will continue to decrease. The capability to manufacture smaller fluidic devices and to quantitatively monitor smaller volumes of liquids bring this process of miniaturization into the domain of laminar flow. New and enabling technologies are being developed using the unique diffusion-based characteristics of the laminar flow domain for sample preparation and analysis. These new analytical systems will have a significant impact on the future of clinical diagnostics. D 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Immunoprecipitation (IP) is a common method for isolating a targeted protein from a complex sample such as blood, serum, or cell lysate. In particular, IP is often used as the primary means of target purification for the analysis by mass spectrometry of novel biologically derived pharmaceuticals, with particular utility for the identification of molecules bound to a protein target. Unfortunately, IP is a labor-intensive technique, is difficult to perform in parallel, and has limited options for automation. Furthermore, the technique is typically limited to large sample volumes, making the application of IP cleanup to precious samples nearly impossible. In recognition of these challenges, we introduce a method for performing microscale IP using magnetic particles and digital microfluidics (DMF-IP). The new method allows for 80\% recovery of model proteins from approximately microliter volumes of serum in a sample-to-answer run time of approximately 25 min. Uniquely, analytes are eluted from these small samples in a format compatible with direct analysis by mass spectrometry. To extend the technique to be useful for large samples, we also developed a macro-to-microscale interface called preconcentration using liquid intake by paper (P-CLIP). This technique allows for efficient analysis of samples {$>$}100{\texttimes} larger than are typically processed on microfluidic devices. As described herein, DMF-IP and P-CLIP-DMF-IP are rapid, automated, and multiplexed methods that have the potential to reduce the time and effort required for IP sample preparations with applications in the fields of pharmacy, biomarker discovery, and protein biology.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting is an electrocapillary phenomenon, i.e. the surface charge generated at the solid-liquid interface through an external voltage improves the wettability in the system. The YoungLippmann equation provides the simplest thermodynamic framework and describes electrowetting adequately. Saturation, i.e. the reduced or nullified effectiveness of the external voltage below a threshold contact angle value, was and remains the most controversial issue in the physics of electrowetting. A simple estimation of the limits of validity of the Young model is obtained by setting the solid-liquid interfacial tension to zero. This approach predicts acceptably the change in electrowetting mechanism but not the minimal value of the contact angle achievable during electrowetting. The mechanism of saturation is, in all probability, related to charge injection into the dielectric layer insulating the working electrode but physical details are scarce. Surface force and spectroscopic techniques should be deployed in order to improve our understanding of the surface charging of insulators immersed in conductive liquids. Electrowetting in solid-liquid-liquid systems is generally more effective and robust. Electrowetting offers new ways of studying the dynamics of liquid movement as it allows selective changes in the wettability of the system.},

In this paper, we report a rapid, portable, and inexpensive DNA hybridization technique using a bead-based microfluidic platform that functions by passing fluorescently labeled target DNA through a chamber packed with functionalized beads within a microfluidic channel. DNA hybridization is then assessed using a digital camera attached to a Clare Chemical DR-45M dark reader non-UV transilluminator that uses visible light as an excitation source and a blue and amber filter to reveal fluorescence. This microfluidic approach significantly enhances hybridization by reducing the diffusion time between target DNA and the silica surface. The use of probe-functionalized beads as solid support also enhances the sensitivity and limit of detection due to a larger surface area per unit volume. This platform could be adapted for use in medical applications and environmental monitoring, including the detection of harmful organisms in the ballast water of ships.},

The present paper characterizes, through an unsteady three-dimensional Volume of Fluid (VOF) simulation, the active control of ferrofluid droplet generation in a microfluidic T-junction in presence of a nonuniform magnetic field created by an external magnetic dipole. Two distinctly different positions of the dipole were considered -- one upstream of the junction and one downstream. While keeping the ferrofluid flow rate fixed, a parametric variation of the continuous phase capillary number, dipole strength, and dipole position was carried out. Differences in the flow behaviour in terms of dripping or jetting and the droplet characteristics in terms of droplet formation time period and droplet size were studied. The existence of a threshold dipole strength, below which the magnetic force was not able to influence the flow behaviour, was identified. It was also observed that, for dipoles placed upstream of the junction, droplet formation was suppressed at some higher dipole strengths, and this value was found to increase with increasing capillary number. Droplet time period was also found to increase with increasing dipole strength, along with droplet size, i.e. an increase in droplet volume.},

High accuracy positioning by placing the droplet inside a micro-frame allows us to fabricate devices with switching gaps as small as {\textasciitilde}10 {\textmu}m. We report switches with switch-on latency of 60 {\textmu}s and switch-off latency of 150 {\textmu}s. The rise and fall time for the switched signal was measured to be below 5 {\textmu}s. In preliminary tests, 1 W of power was hotswitched for 10's of cycles without any visual degradation. Combining with the RF performance results and the inherent contact reliability of LM, we are developing microswitches for RF applications.},

A bimetallic iron-aluminate (Fe-Al) mixed metal-oxide nano-composite (MMON) on glassy carbon electrode was synthesized using novel solid phase synthesis method. An ammonium ion exchange reaction in solid reagent with simultaneous ammonia evolution produced unique rodshaped Fe-Al MMON without any solvent addition. The chitosan-mediated electrode (Ch-MMON/GCE) was used to simultaneously detect three most harmful HMs using three anodic stripping techniques namely, cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Three distinct stripping peaks were obtained with concentrations in parts per trillion (ppt) using each of these methods using acetate buffer (0.1 M, pH = 4.5). Obtained LODs for Cd(II), Pb(II), and Hg(II), being 1.678 ppt, 0.301 ppt and 0.658 ppt, respectively by CV whereas LSV gave 1.791 ppt, 0.798 ppt and 2.205 ppt respectively DPV yielded 0.068 ppt, 0.034 ppt and 0.053 ppt, respectively. As observed, DPV was found to be the most sensitive method even though all LOD values were well below the drinking water permissible limits stipulated by WHO. Possible mechanism of ultrasensitive HM detection by the Ch-MMON/GCE was discussed. The modified electrode was successfully used to measure HMs present in water of river Ganges water eliciting significant performance and reliability.},

  abstract = {An electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD)-based micropump was used as a platform to study the contribution of the pinning and wetting-line velocity effects on its flow rate. In this micropump, a droplet is driven into a microchannel using EWOD to manipulate a meniscus in the channel. An interesting observation was that the shrinking input droplet changes its shape in two modes: (1) in the first mode, droplet contact angle decreases while its wetting area remains constant (pinning) and (2) in the second mode, droplet wetting line recedes while its contact angle changes as a function of its velocity (dynamic contact angle). Unexpectedly, the micropump flow rate was found to be constant in spite of the changes in the droplet radius. The pump performance was studied to unravel the physical concept behind its constant flow rate. A detailed characterization of variation in contact angle due to pinning, wetting-line velocity, and EWOD was carried out. Dynamic contact angles were used to accurately calculate the pressure gradient between the droplet and the meniscus for flow rate estimation. It was shown that neglecting either the wetting-line energy or the velocity effect results in not only a considerable gap between the predicted and the measured flow rates but also an unphysical instability in flow rate analysis. However, when these effects were fully taken into account, an excellent agreement between the predicted and the measured flow rates was obtained.},

Reactors were fed with influents containing 0, 5, and 25 mg=L of GO (12 h cycles) for 11 days. Results showed that the ammonia removal efficiency increased as the GO dose varied within 5--25 mg=L in reactors after 7 days. The abundance of Firmicutes, Sphingobium, and Leuconostoc in reactors fed with GO at concentration of 25 mg=L were significantly higher than that in control reactors, and the abundance of Sphingobium increased with the increasing concentration of GO in reactors; however, the abundance of Klebsiella decreased with the increasing concentration of GO in reactors. The results indicated that a reasonable microbial community restructured by GO might play a crucial role in promoting ammonia removal.

Nickel cobalt nitride electrodes demonstrate electrocatalytic behaviours toward glucose oxidation and hydrogen peroxide reduction processes. Meanwhile, zirconium nitride electrodes could replace platinum/carbon electrodes for oxygen reduction reaction. This article also introduces solid molybdenum nitride microdisk electrodes, which can easily be prepared and maintained and show diffusion-control voltammetric responses for the complex peroxodisulfate reduction reaction.

Many environmental studies conducted in this country began to utilise the chemometrics techniques to overcome the limitation in the environmental monitoring studies. Chemometrics becomes an important tool in environmental fields to evaluate the relationship of various environmental variables particularly in a large and complex database. The review aimed to analyse and summarize the current evidences and limitations on the application of chemometrics techniques in the environmental studies in Malaysia. The study performed a comprehensive review of relevant scientific journals concerning on the major environmental issues in the country, published between 2013 and 2017. A total of 29 papers which focused on the environmental issues were reviewed. Available evidences suggested that chemometrics techniques have a greater accuracy, flexibility and efficiency to be applied in environmental modelling. It also reported that chemometrics techniques are more practical for cost effective and time management in sampling and monitoring purposes. However, chemometrics is relatively new in environmental field in Malaysia and various scopes need to be considered in the future as the current studies focused on very limited number of major environmental issues. Overall, chemometrics techniques have a lot of advantages in solving environmental problems. The development of chemometrics in environmental studies in the country is necessary to advance understanding, thus able to produce more significant impacts towards the effective environmental management.},

  abstract = {Carbon is one of the versatile materials used in modern life for human welfare. It has a wide range of applications such as drug delivery, coatings, energy generation and storage, gas separation, water purification, sensor fabrication, and catalysis. Most of the widely used carbon materials are graphene and carbon nanotubes. Nonrenewable precursors (e.g., natural gas), toxic chemicals, and complex synthesis methods are often required for their preparation, limiting their wide practical applications. Besides these, biomass-derived carbons are attractive materials as they can be prepared simply from renewable biomass. However, their practical applications' success partially depends on their properties like size, shape, porosity, and presence of heteroatoms, which can be controlled by selecting the proper type of biomass, activating agent, and preparation method. It is noted that different species of plants have different chemical compositions and textures. This mini-review summarizes our group's recent sophisticated developments in agricultural-bio-waste-derived carbonaceous materials, including nanomaterials for electrocatalytic water splitting, electrochemical sensors, supercapacitors, water splitting, water treatment, gas separation, and enhance oil recovery. This offers valuable insights and essential guidelines towards the future design of agro-waste derived carbonaceous materials in various applications.},

Moreover, different strategies for tailoring the surface properties of PDMS microchannels and immobilization of biomolecules are discussed.           ,                             Microfluidics is an emerging and multidisciplinary field that is of great interest to manufacturers in medicine, biotechnology, and chemistry, as it provides unique tools for the development of point-of-care diagnostics, organs-on-chip systems, and biosensors. Polymeric microfluidics, unlike glass and silicon, offer several advantages such as low-cost mass manufacturing and a wide range of beneficial material properties, which make them the material of choice for commercial applications and high-throughput systems. Among polymers used for the fabrication of microfluidic devices, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) still remains the most widely used material in academia due to its advantageous properties, such as excellent transparency and biocompatibility. However, commercialization of PDMS has been a challenge mostly due to the high cost of the current fabrication strategies. Moreover, specific surface modification and functionalization steps are required to tailor the surface chemistry of PDMS channels (               e.g.               biomolecule immobilization, surface hydrophobicity and antifouling properties) with respect to the desired application. While significant research has been reported in the field of PDMS microfluidics, functionalization of PDMS surfaces remains a critical step in the fabrication process that is difficult to navigate. This review first offers a thorough illustration of existing fabrication methods for PDMS-based microfluidic devices, providing several recent advancements in this field with the aim of reducing the cost and time for mass production of these devices. Next, various conventional and emerging approaches for engineering the surface chemistry of PDMS are discussed in detail. We provide a wide range of functionalization techniques rendering PDMS microchannels highly biocompatible for physical or covalent immobilization of various biological entities while preventing non-specific interactions.},

Investigating cell response to various stimulations is much more accurate and comprehensive with the aid of microfluidic devices. In this study, we introduced a microfluidic device by which the matrix density as a mechanical property and the concentration profile of a biochemical factor as a chemical property could be altered. Our microfluidic device has a cell tank and a cell culture chamber to mimic both 2D to 3D and 3D to 3D migration of three types of cells. Fluid shear stress is negligible on the cells and a stable concentration gradient can be obtained by diffusion. The device was designed by a numerical simulation so that the uniformity of the concentration gradients throughout the cell culture chamber was obtained. Adult neural cells were cultured within this device and they showed different branching and axonal navigation phenotypes within varying nerve growth factor (NGF) concentration profiles. Neural stem cells were also cultured within varying collagen matrix densities while exposed to NGF concentrations and they experienced 3D to 3D collective migration. By generating vascular endothelial growth factor concentration gradients, adult human dermal microvascular endothelial cells also migrated in a 2D to 3D manner and formed a stable lumen within a specific collagen matrix density. It was observed that a minimum absolute concentration and concentration gradient were required to stimulate migration of all types of the cells. This device has the advantage of changing multiple parameters simultaneously and is expected to have wide applicability in cell studies.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, the importance of the blood particles separation is undeniable in medical fields and there are different sorts of separation methods accordingly. Acoustic cell separation is chosen in this paper. Also, numerical methods have been used to study the effect of geometrical factors on the separation of the particles before spending time and expenses in a trial and error manner experimentally. We have implemented a plenary finite-element-based simulation of separating blood particles such as white blood cells and platelets in an acoustic field using standing surface acoustic waves. In this paper, unlike previous works in which the channel is rectangular; the channel is trapezoidal in order to make the separation more efficient. By changing the trapezoidal leg angle, WBC's distance from the midline will be different. The designed device is a bio-MEMS channel containing two inlets which are for the sheath flow and for the blood particles, a trapezoidal main channel, and three outlets. Two aluminum interdigital transducers are located on the LiNbO3 substrate. For creating the acoustic force, we have applied an alternating voltage to transducers. Blood particles will be moved toward the acoustic nodes because of the positive acoustic contrast factor. Since acoustic radiation force depends on the size of the particles and their compressibility, cells can be sorted according to their diameter and compressibility; hence, particles will be separated. For optimizing the device, we have changed the trapezoidal channel angle, the input voltage, and the flow rate.},

Here, we report the first integration of ECL with digital microfluidics (DMF). ECL detectors were fabricated into the ITO-coated top plates of DMF devices, allowing for the generation of light from electrically excited luminophores in sample droplets. The new system was characterized by making electrochemical and ECL measurements of soluble mixtures of tris(phenanthroline)ruthenium(II) and tripropylamine (TPA) solutions. The system was then validated by application to an oligonucleotide hybridization assay, using magnetic particles bearing 21mer, deoxyribose analogues of the complement to microRNA-143 (miRNA-143). The system detects single nucleotide mismatches with high specificity, and has a limit of detection of 1.5 femtomoles. The system is capable of detecting miRNA-143 in cancer cell lysates, allowing for the discrimination between the MCF-7 (less aggressive) and MDA-MB-231 (more aggressive) cell lines. We propose that DMF-ECL represents a valuable new tool in the microfluidics toolbox for a wide variety of applications.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) chips have emerged as popular actuators for droplet-based digital microfluidic biochips. The chip-level design of EWOD chips allows for the integration electrode addressing and wire routing, thus helping cope with the increasing complexity of biochemical assays. Furthermore, high-frequency EWODs also facilitate finishing time-sensitive bioassays such as incubation and emerging flash chemistry in specific time periods. However, the reliability of the EWOD chip is reduced by the contact angle change reduction problem as a result of the repeated and frequent switching of electrodes. Thus, the chip-level design of EWOD chips should consider reliability, electrode addressing, and the wire routing problem. This paper presents a graph-based chip-level design algorithm. By setting the switching-time constraint, the number of switching times can be limited to minimize the impact of the contact angle change reductions problem. Also, a progressive addressing and routing approach is proposed to overcome the complex wire routing problem. Experimental results show the proposed algorithm effectively minimizes the impact of the contact angle change reduction problem, thus providing a reliable chip-level design with a feasible wire routing solution with the required number of pins.},

Herein, for the first time, we present a platform based on droplet microfluidics coupling with the recombinase aided amplification (RAA)-assisted one-pot clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats together with CRISPR-associated proteins 13a (CRISPR/Cas13a) assay, and droplet encoding strategy for accurate and sensitive determination of nucleic acids from various foodborne pathogens. The workflow takes full advantage of CRISPR/Cas13a signal amplification and droplet confinement effects, which enhances the detection sensitivity and enables end-point quantitation. Meanwhile, by varying the color of droplets, the number of bacteria detected at the same time is greatly improved. It possesses the capability to simultaneously detect seven different types of foodborne pathogens. Notably, the system is also applied to real food samples with satisfactory results. Overall, in view of superiorities in high sensitivity, outstanding selectivity, and large-scale multiplexing, the one-pot CRISPR/Cas13a-based droplet microfluidic system could be expanded and universalized for identifying other bacteria.},

  abstract = {Acoustic waves at microwave frequencies have been widely used in wireless communication and recently emerged as versatile information carriers in quantum applications. However, most acoustic devices are passive components, and dynamic control of acoustic waves in a low-loss and scalable manner remains an outstanding challenge, which hinders the development of phononic integrated circuits. Here we demonstrate electrical control of traveling acoustic waves on an integrated lithium niobate platform at both room and millikelvin temperatures. We modulate the phase and amplitude of the acoustic waves and demonstrate an acoustic frequency shifter by serrodyne phase modulation. Furthermore, we show reconfigurable nonreciprocal modulation by tailoring the phase matching between acoustic and quasi-traveling electric fields. Our scalable electro-acoustic platform comprises the fundamental elements for arbitrary acoustic signal processing and manipulation of phononic quantum information.},

The findings of this water quality assessment, based on data collected between September and October 2012, indicated that a majority of the lakes were classified as Class II (Clean) waters suitable for recreational use. The results of the trophic state assessments, however, indicated that all of the lakes were eutrophic, meaning they were nutrient-rich, they could experience algae blooms or macrophyte problems, and they were likely to exhibit poor water quality. Sustainable management measures and strategies are suggested to address the eutrophication problems of Malaysian lakes and reservoirs, with the national responses on lake and reservoir management also being discussed.},

It can enter the food supply chain at various stages of production, processing, distribution, and marketing. High prevalence of Salmonella necessitates efficient and effective approaches for its identification, detection, and monitoring at an early stage. Because conventional methods based on plate counting and real-time polymerase chain reaction are timeconsuming and laborious, novel rapid detection methods are urgently needed for in-field and on-line applications. Biosensors provide many advantages over conventional laboratory assays in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, and show superiority in rapid response and potential portability. They are now recognized as promising alternative tools and one of the most on-site applicable and end user--accessible methods for rapid detection. In recent years, we have witnessed a flourishing of studies in the development of robust and elaborate biosensors for detection of Salmonella in food. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview on Salmonella biosensors by highlighting different signal-transducing mechanisms (optical, electrochemical, piezoelectric, etc.) and critically analyzing its recent trends, particularly in combination with nanomaterials, microfluidics, portable instruments, and smartphones. Furthermore, current challenges are emphasized and future perspectives are discussed.},

  abstract = {NH3 production is dependent on the century-old Haber-Bosch process, which is energy and capital intensive and relies on H2 from steam reforming, hence, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Electrochemical NH3 synthesis can be realized by reaction of N2 and a proton source under mild conditions powered by renewable electricity, which offers a promising carbon-neutral and sustainable strategy. However, N2 has remarkable thermodynamic stability and requires high energy to be activated. Implementation of this ``clean'' NH3 synthesis route therefore still requires significant enhancement in energy efficiency, conversion rate, and durability, which is only achievable through the design of efficient electrocatalysts. This article provides a timely theoretical and experimental overview of recent advances in the electrocatalytic conversion of N2 to NH3 underlining the development of novel electrocatalysts. Advances of in situ and operando studies for mechanistic understanding of the reaction and the main challenges and strategies for improving electrocatalytic N2 reduction are highlighted.},

According to pharmacopeia requirements, sub-visible particle levels need to be controlled throughout the shelf life of the product. Therefore, in addition to determining the particle counts, it is crucial to accurately characterize the particles in a drug product to understand the stress condition of exposure and make appropriate mitigation actions for specific formulations. In this study, we developed a new method for intelligently characterizing the protein particles by micro-Raman spectroscopy on a digital microfluidic chip (DMF). Microliters of stress degradation-induced protein particle solutions were loaded onto the DMF chip, and multiple droplets were generated and used for Raman spectroscopy testing. Multiple machine learning classification models were trained by Raman spectra of the obtained protein particles, and the eight protein particles were successfully characterized and predicted with high classification accuracy (93\% - 100\%). The advantages of the proposed novel particle characterization method include a closed system to prevent particle contamination, one-stop testing of morphological and chemical structure information, low sample volume consumption, reusable particle droplets, and simplified data analysis and high classification accuracy. It provides great potential to determine the probable root cause of particle sources or stress conditions based on a single assay to develop an accurate particle control strategies that ultimately extend the product shelf-life.},

Its abnormal fluctuations are commonly believed to be associated with cancers and other diseases. Herein, a series of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanosensors with high sensitivity and targeting function was prepared for the quantification and monitoring of pH values in mitochondria, nucleus, and lysosome. The nanosensors were composed of gold nanorods (AuNRs) functionalized with a pH-responsive molecule (4-mercaptopyridine, MPy) and peptides that could specifically deliver the AuNRs to the targeting subcellular organelles. The localization of our prepared nanoprobes in specific organelles was confirmed by super-high resolution fluorescence imaging and bio-transmission electron microscopy (TEM) methods. By the targeting ability, the pH values of the specific organelles can be determined by monitoring the vibrational spectral changes of MPy with different pH values. Compared to the cases of reported lysosome and cytoplasm SERS pH sensors, more accurate pH values of mitochondria and nucleus, which could be two additional intracellular tracers for subcellular microenvironments, were disclosed by this SERS approach, further improving the accuracy of discrimination of related diseases. Our sensitive SERS strategy can also be employed to explore crucial physiological and biological processes that are related to subcellular pH fluctuations.},

However, current commercial ddPCR devices for detecting the gene chip are time consuming due to complex image stitching. To address this issue, we propose a universal concentration determination system and realize one-time gene chip imaging with high resolution. All the functional units are controlled by self-developed software using the PyQt5 module in Python. Without stitching technology, images of the ddPCR chip (28 mm {\texttimes} 18 mm) containing 20\,000 independent 0.81 nL micro chambers can be obtained in less than 15 seconds, which saves about 165 seconds. A white laser light source (2 mW cm               -2               ) was employed as a substitute for the mercury lamp. Its wavelength matches well with typical fluorescent dyes (               e.g.               , HEX, ROX and Cy5), and thus it can strengthen the fluorescence intensity for weak signals. The results also demonstrated that the correlation coefficient for the measured concentration and theoretical value was above 99\%, by testing the ddPCR products with COVID-19 virus. Such a system can greatly reduce the time required for image acquisition and DNA concentration determination, and thus is able to speed up the lab-to-application process for ddPCR technology.},

On this platform, fluorescence magnetic beads (MBs) were used as carriers for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection. In human genome, SNPs are responsible for the variations between individuals. The genome of a person comprise specific SNP could result in responsiveness to drug therapies and sensitivity of certain disease. Therefore, SNP is considered as one of the keys to predict the affect in pharmacogenomic medicine.

  abstract = {Nanomedicine has made significant advances in clinical applications since the late-20th century, in part due to its distinct advantages in biocompatibility, potency, and novel therapeutic applications. Many nanoparticle (NP) therapies have been approved for clinical use, including as imaging agents or as platforms for drug delivery and gene therapy. However, there are remaining challenges that hinder translation, such as non-scalable production methods and the inefficiency of current NP formulations in delivering their cargo to their target. To address challenges with existing formulation methods that have batch-to-batch variability and produce particles with high dispersity, microfluidics---devices that manipulate fluids on a micrometer scale---have demonstrated enormous potential to generate reproducible NP formulations for therapeutic, diagnostic, and preventative applications. Microfluidic-generated NP formulations have been shown to have enhanced properties for biomedical applications by formulating NPs with more controlled physical properties than is possible with bulk techniques---such as size, size distribution, and loading efficiency. In this review, we highlight advances in microfluidic technologies for the formulation of NPs, with an emphasis on lipid-based NPs, polymeric NPs, and inorganic NPs. We provide a summary of microfluidic devices used for NP formulation with their advantages and respective challenges. Additionally, we provide our analysis for future outlooks in the field of NP formulation and microfluidics, with emerging topics of production scale-independent formulations through device parallelization and multi-step reactions within droplets.},

Among various point-of-care-testing platforms, microfluidic chips have many outstanding advantages. Microfluidic chip applies the technology of miniaturizing conventional laboratory which enables the whole biochemical process including reagent loading, reaction, separation, and detection on the microchip. As a result, microfluidic platform has become a hotspot of research in the fields of food safety, health care, and environmental monitoring in the past few decades. Here, the state-of-the-art application of microfluidics in immunoassay in the past decade will be reviewed. According to different driving forces of fluid, microfluidic platform is divided into two parts: passive manipulation and active manipulation. In passive manipulation, we focus on the capillary-driven microfluidics, while in active manipulation, we introduce pressure microfluidics, centrifugal microfluidics, electric microfluidics, optofluidics, magnetic microfluidics, and digital microfluidics. Additionally, within the introduction of each platform, innovation of the methods used and their corresponding performance improvement will be discussed. Ultimately, the shortcomings of different platforms and approaches for improvement will be proposed.},

In the first assay, three cell lines (HeLa, CHO-K1, and NIH-3T3) were seeded at different densities to determine the relationship between impedance and cell number, which was found to be linear for each type of cell. In the proliferation assay, cells were grown for four days and their proliferation rates were determined by regular impedance measurements. In the serum sensing assay, a dilution series of cell media containing different concentrations of serum was evaluated using impedance measurements to determine the optimum conditions for proliferation. The DMF impedance system is label-free, does not require imaging, and is compatible with long-term cell culture. We propose that this system will be useful for the growing number of scientists who are seeking methods other than fluorescence or cell sorting to analyze adherent cells in situ.},

  abstract = {We have developed a new hybrid droplet-to-digital microfluidic platform (D2D) that integrates droplet-in-channel microfluidics with digital microfluidics for performing multi-step single cell assays.           ,                             We have developed a new hybrid droplet-to-digital microfluidic platform (D2D) that integrates droplet-in-channel microfluidics with digital microfluidics (DMF) for performing multi-step assays. This D2D platform combines the strengths of the two formats---droplets-in-channel for facile generation of droplets containing single cells, and DMF for on-demand manipulation of droplets including control of different droplet volumes (pL--{$\mu$}L), creation of a dilution series of ionic liquid (IL), and parallel single cell culturing and analysis for IL toxicity screening. This D2D device also allows for automated analysis that includes a feedback-controlled system for merging and splitting of droplets to add reagents, an integrated Peltier element for parallel cell culture at optimum temperature, and an impedance sensing mechanism to control the flow rate for droplet generation and preventing droplet evaporation. Droplet-in-channel is well-suited for encapsulation of single cells as it allows the careful manipulation of flow rates of aqueous phase containing cells and oil to optimize encapsulation. Once single cell containing droplets are generated, they are transferred to a DMF chip               via               a capillary where they are merged with droplets containing IL and cultured at 30 {$^\circ$}C. The DMF chip, in addition to permitting cell culture and reagent (ionic liquid/salt) addition, also allows recovery of individual droplets for off-chip analysis such as further culturing and measurement of ethanol production. The D2D chip was used to evaluate the effect of IL/salt type (four types: NaOAc, NaCl, [C               2               mim] [OAc], [C               2               mim] [Cl]) and concentration (four concentrations: 0, 37.5, 75, 150 mM) on the growth kinetics and ethanol production of yeast and as expected, increasing IL concentration led to lower biomass and ethanol production. Specifically, [C               2               mim] [OAc] had inhibitory effects on yeast growth at concentrations 75 and 150 mM and significantly reduced their ethanol production compared to cells grown in other ILs/salts. The growth curve trends obtained by D2D matched conventional yeast culturing in microtiter wells, validating the D2D platform. We believe that our approach represents a generic platform for multi-step biochemical assays such as drug screening, digital PCR, enzyme assays, immunoassays and cell-based assays.},

In particular, we demonstrate increased efficiency and speed in carrying out particle concentration/separation and in generating intense micromixing in microliter drops within which acoustic streaming is induced due to the focused SAW beneath the drop. Concentric circular and elliptical single-phase unidirectional transducers (SPUDTs) were used to focus the SAW. We benchmark our results against a straight SPUDT which does not cause focusing of the SAW. Due to the increased wave intensity and asymmetry of the wave, we found both circular and elliptical SPUDTs concentrate particles in under 1 s, which is one order of magnitude faster than the straight SPUDT and several orders of magnitude faster than conventional microscale devices. The concentric circular SPUDT was found to be most effective at a given input power since it generated the largest azimuthal velocity gradient within the fluid to drive particle shear migration. On the other hand, the concentric elliptical SPUDT generated the highest micromixing intensity due to the more narrowly focused SAW radiation that substantially enhances acoustic streaming in the fluid.},

  abstract = {This paper reports on a technique that significantly improves the performance of open-plate electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) devices by using chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) to achieve surface planarization. In EWOD devices, trenches are inevitably generated during fabrication, and these can have a considerable effect on droplet manipulation. Such artefacts lead to a local intensification in the electric field that not only hinders the droplet movement due to a partially increased adhesion force, but also limits the maximum applicable potential by increasing the likelihood of a dielectric breakdown. We conducted theoretical and experimental studies on the effect of trenches on the performance of both unpolished and polished EWOD devices. Various combinations of the droplet volume and electrode size were tested, and our proposed technique resulted in a notable improvement for all cases. For instance, when operating at 100 V, a 3.5 {$\mu$}L droplet could be translated at 70 mm/s on the polished EWOD device, which is twice as fast as that for its unpolished counterpart at the same voltage. Also, the maximum applicable potential resulting in a dielectric breakdown of the polished EWOD device was measured to be 27\% higher than that of a conventional device.},

  abstract = {A critical unmet need in the diagnosis of bacterial infections, which remain a major cause of human morbidity and mortality, is the detection of scarce bacterial pathogens in a variety of samples in a rapid and quantitative manner. Herein, we demonstrate smartphone-based detection of Staphylococcus aureus in a culture-free, rapid, quantitative manner from minimally processed liquid samples using aptamer-functionalized fluorescent magnetic nanoparticles. The tagged S. aureus cells were magnetically captured in a detection cassette, and then fluorescence was imaged using a smartphone camera with a light-emitting diode as the excitation source. Our results showed quantitative detection capability with a minimum detectable concentration as low as 10 cfu/ml by counting individual bacteria cells, efficiently capturing S. aureus cells directly from a peanut milk sample within 10 min. When the selectivity of detection was investigated using samples spiked with other pathogenic bacteria, no significant non-specific detection occurred. Furthermore, strains of S. aureus from various origins showed comparable results, ensuring that the approach can be widely adopted. Therefore, the quantitative fluorescence imaging platform on a smartphone could allow on-site detection of bacteria, providing great potential assistance during major infectious disease outbreaks in remote and resource-limited settings.},

  abstract = {With the advancement of digital microfluidics technology, applications such as on-chip DNA analysis, point of care diagnosis and automated drug discovery are common nowadays. The use of Digital Microfluidics Biochips (DMFBs) in disease assessment and recognition of target molecules had become popular during the past few years. The reliability of these DMFBs is crucial when they are used in various medical applications. Errors found in these biochips are mainly due to the defects developed during droplet manipulation, chip degradation and inaccuracies in the bio-assay experiments. The recently proposed Micro-electrode-dot Array (MEDA)-based DMFBs involve both fluidic and electronic domains in the micro-electrode cell. Thus, the testing techniques for these biochips should be revised in order to ensure proper functionality. This paper describes recent advances in the testing technologies for digital microfluidics biochips, which would serve as a useful platform for developing revised/new testing techniques for MEDA-based biochips. Therefore, the relevancy of these techniques with respect to testing of MEDA-based biochips is analyzed in order to exploit the full potential of these biochips.},

  abstract = {Water is one of the basic necessities in life. In Malaysia, Ammonia NH3 is found to be one of the main causes of water pollution according to Jabatan Alam Sekitar (JAS). To minimize this issue, this paper proposes an alternative way to detect ammonia content in the river using a microfluidic device. The microfluidic device is based on electrochemical detection that uses an ammonia ion-selective electrode in order to detect the ammonia content in water. The main advantage of this method is able to detect ammonia content in water and short response time. Ammonia ion-selective electrode has a selective membrane which only allows the ammonia ion to pass through. The microfluidic device was designed and simulated in COMSOL software. The proposed microfluidic device will be optimized using finite element analysis (FEA) in COMSOL software and the performance of the proposed microfluidic device will be validated by comparing the simulations' results and the theoretical results. It is found that the proposed solution follows the Nernst equation with a short response time, i.e. 4 seconds. The ion-selective electrode showed an ionselective towards ammonia ion that only allow ammonia ion to pass through the selective membrane. The proposed solution can be used for ammonia detection in water quality monitoring.},

To mitigate these issues, a number of different biosensors have been developed, including lateral flow assays (LFAs), which have emerged as valuable tools in pathogen detection due to their portability, ease of use, time efficiency, and cost effectiveness. The performance of LFAs has been considerably enhanced by the development of new nanomaterials over the years.

  abstract = {The miniaturization of laboratory procedures for Lab-on-Chip (LoC) devices and translation to various platforms such as single cell analysis or Organ-on-Chip (OoC) systems are revolutionizing the life sciences and biomedical fields. As a result, microfluidics is becoming a viable technology for improving the quality and sensitivity of critical processes. Yet, standard test methods have not yet been established to validate basic manufacturing steps, performance, and safety of microfluidic devices. The successful development and widespread use of microfluidic technologies are greatly dependent on the community's success in establishing widely supported test protocols. A key area that requires consensus guidelines is leakage testing. There are unique challenges in preventing and detecting leaks in microfluidic systems because of their small dimensions, high surface-area to volume ratios, low flow rates, limited volumes, and relatively high-pressure differentials over short distances. Also, microfluidic devices often employ heterogenous components, including unique connectors and fluid-contacting materials, which potentially make them more susceptible to mechanical integrity failures. The differences between microfluidic systems and traditional macroscale technologies can exacerbate the impact of a leak on the performance and safety on the microscale. To support the microfluidics community efforts in product development and commercialization, it is critical to identify common aspects of leakage in microfluidic devices and standardize the corresponding safety and performance metrics. There is a need for quantitative metrics to provide quality assurance during or after the manufacturing process. It is also necessary to implement application-specific test methods to effectively characterize leakage in microfluidic systems. In this review, different methods for assessing microfluidics leaks, the benefits of using different test media and materials, and the utility of leakage testing throughout the product life cycle are discussed. Current leakage testing protocols and standard test methods that can be leveraged for characterizing leaks in microfluidic devices and potential classification strategies are also discussed. We hope that this review article will stimulate more discussions around the development of gas and liquid leakage test standards in academia and industry to facilitate device commercialization in the emerging field of microfluidics.},

It is used for analysis of different biological samples like protein, sirum etc using an array of electrically controlled electrodes. This paper deals with a challenging problem related to the design of DMFB. Specifically the design problem considered is related to high performance droplet routing, where each droplet has single source location and single target location. The objectives are (i) minimizing the number of electrodes used in the DMFB, and (ii) minimizing total routing timellatest arrival time of all the droplet at their target locations. We propose a simple algorithm for concurrent path allocation to multiple droplets, based on the classical shortest-path algorithm, together with the use of stalling, and possible detouring of droplets in cases of contentions. The algorithm is also extended to droplet routing where a droplet may have two source positions and a single target position. The algorithm is implemented on a Linux platform and empirical results are quite encouraging.},

A flexible sensor for measuring the level of ammonia in water or aqueous solution has been fabricated and tested. Most of the conventional sensors are either not stable or suitable for the measurement of underwater ammonia. Because of this, we intend to make a modest attempt to propose a low-cost, foldable, stable, and reliable Copper oxide (CuO) nanowire electrode-based ammonia sensitive extended gate field-effect transistor (EG-FET). In this article, CuO nanowire has been synthesized at low temperatures for realizing an extended gate for field-effecttransistor (FET). The device has been characterized for aqueous ammonia sensing at different levels of concentrations of ammonia. The sensor exhibits very high linearity [{$>$} 99\%] along with high sensitivity ({$>$}65 [mV]/[mg/L] and 1.62 {$\mu\mathbit{A}\mathbf{1}$}/{$\mathbf{2}$} / [mg/L]). The sensor performance has also been studied under the bending condition showing an excellent sensing performance and linearity without any performance degradation. The various characterizations have been done to validate the crystalline, uniform, and dense formation of CuO nanowires using a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM) and tunnel microscope TEM. The device is well suited to measure the NH3 content (from 1.5 mg/L (or ppm) to 7.5 mg/L) in an aqueous solution.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting is an electrokinetic effect whereby an applied electric field induces changes in the measured contact angle at a fluid-surface contact line. On hydrophobic, dielectric electrode surfaces, this effect generates droplet motion termed ``electrowetting on dielectric'' or EWOD. Applications of this phenomenon range from lab-on-a-chip to liquid lenses capable of altering their topology and focus within milliseconds. Electrowetting or EWOD theoretical models quantifying this effect fall into two paradigms: the Young-Lippman and the electromechanical theories. In this work, both paradigms were simulated to predict the velocity of a water droplet moving over an array of electrodes. Results were compared to experimental observations of measured velocities for two dielectric films: ETFE and household cling film. Theoretical model parameters, namely the length scale of the Maxwell force on the droplet, were also determined to align simulation and experiment. The results reveal the trend of droplet velocity in relation to applied voltage, and recapitulate the relationship between the two models.},

  abstract = {Realization of generic logic gates and circuits forms the basis of modern computational platforms, which have brought visible changes in everyone's life. As the miniaturization of solid-state logic systems approach fundamental limits, designing digital logic in fluidics has emerged as a new paradigm to go beyond current architectures and exploit the computational efficiency of soft biological systems. This work reviews emerging fluidic approaches and their implementation as ``fluidic logic gates'' and circuits. Such platforms are categorized into passive and active fluidic logic based on design-of-integration, operational principles, and application. As the use of such fluidic logic for real computation depends on their large-scale integration, we evaluated miniaturization strategies and associated challenges. Furthermore, we propose integration of such fluidic logics with complementary metal oxide semiconductor-compatible ion-sensitive field-effect transistors, serving as a potential bridge between electronics and fluidics to allow integration of different computational paradigms in the upcoming era of computational convergence.},

  abstract = {Easy-to-use and on-site detection of dissolved ammonia are essential for managing aquatic ecosystems and aquaculture products since low levels of ammonia can cause serious health risks and harm aquatic life. This work demonstrates quantitative naked eye detection of dissolved ammonia based on polydiacetylene (PDA) sensors with machine learning classifiers. PDA vesicles were assembled from diacetylene monomers through a facile green chemical synthesis which exhibited a blue-to-red color transition upon exposure to dissolved ammonia and was detectable by the naked eye. The quantitative color change was studied by UV-vis spectroscopy, and it was found that the absorption peak at 640 nm gradually decreased, and the absorption peak at 540 nm increased with increasing ammonia concentration. The fabricated PDA sensor exhibited a detection limit of ammonia below 10 ppm with a response time of 20 min. Also, the PDA sensor could be stably operated for up to 60 days by storing in a refrigerator. Furthermore, the quantitative on-site monitoring of dissolved ammonia was investigated using colorimetric images with machine learning classifiers. Using a support vector machine for the machine learning model, the classification of ammonia concentration was possible with a high accuracy of 100 and 95.1\% using color RGB images captured by a scanner and a smartphone, respectively. These results indicate that using the developed PDA sensor, a simple naked eye detection for dissolved ammonia is possible with higher accuracy and on-site detection enabled by the smartphone and machine learning processes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Newborn screening for lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) has been gaining considerable interest owing to the availability of enzyme replacement therapies. We present a digital microfluidic platform to perform rapid, multiplexed enzymatic analysis of acid -glucosidase (GAA) and acid -galactosidase to screen for Pompe and Fabry disorders. The results were compared with those obtained using standard fluorometric methods. METHODS: We performed bench-based, fluorometric enzymatic analysis on 60 deidentified newborn dried blood spots (DBSs), plus 10 Pompe-affected and 11 Fabryaffected samples, at Duke Biochemical Genetics Laboratory using a 3-mm punch for each assay and an incubation time of 20 h. We used a digital microfluidic platform to automate fluorometric enzymatic assays at Advanced Liquid Logic Inc. using extract from a single punch for both assays, with an incubation time of 6 h. Assays were also performed with an incubation time of 1 h. RESULTS: Assay results were generally comparable, although mean enzymatic activity for GAA using microfluidics was approximately 3 times higher than that obtained using bench-based methods, which could be attributed to higher substrate concentration. Clear separation was observed between the normal and affected samples at both 6- and 1-h incubation times using digital microfluidics. CONCLUSIONS: A digital microfluidic platform compared favorably with a clinical reference laboratory to perform enzymatic analysis in DBSs for Pompe and Fabry disorders. This platform presents a new technology for a newborn screening laboratory to screen LSDs},

  abstract = {Children are not tiny adults'' is an adage commonly used in pediatrics to emphasize the fact that children often have different physiological responses to sickness and trauma compared to adults. However, despite widespread acceptance of this concept, diagnostic blood testing is an excellent example of clinical care that is not yet customized to the needs of children, especially newborns. Cumulative blood loss resulting from clinical testing does not typically impact critically ill adult patients, but can quickly escalate in children, leading to iatrogenic anemia and related comorbidities. Moreover, the tests prioritized for rapid, near-patient testing in adults are not always the most clinically relevant tests for children or newborns. This report describes the development of a digital microfluidic testing platform and associated clinical assays purposely curated to address current shortcomings in pediatric laboratory testing by using microliter volumes ({$<$}50 {\textmu}L) of samples. The automated platform consists of a small instrument and single-use cartridges, which contain all reagents necessary to prepare the sample and perform the assay. Electrowetting technology is used to precisely manipulate nanoliter-sized droplets of samples and reagents inside the cartridge. To date, we have automated three disparate types of assays (biochemical assays, immunoassays, and molecular assays) on the platform and have developed over two dozen unique tests, each with important clinical application to newborns and pediatric patients. Cell lysis, plasma preparation, magnetic bead washing, thermocycling, incubation, and many other essential functions were all performed on the cartridge without any user intervention. The resulting assays demonstrate performance comparable to standard clinical laboratory assays and are economical due to the reduced hands-on effort required for each assay and lower overall reagent consumption. These capabilities allow a wide range of assays to be run simultaneously on the same cartridge using significantly reduced sample volumes with results in minutes.},

We present performance validation data on a digital microfluidic platform that performs multiplex enzymatic assays for Pompe, Fabry, Hunter, Gaucher, and Hurler diseases. Methods: We developed an investigational disposable digital microfluidic cartridge that uses a single dried blood spot (DBS) punch for performing a 5-plex fluorometric enzymatic assay on up to 44 DBS samples. Precision and linearity of the assays were determined by analyzing quality control DBS samples; clinical performance was determined by analyzing 600 presumed normal and known affected samples (12 for Pompe, 7 for Fabry and 10 each for Hunter, Gaucher and Hurler). Results: Overall coefficient of variation (CV) values between cartridges, days, instruments, and operators ranged from 2 to 21\%; linearity correlation coefficients were {$\geq$} 0.98 for all assays. The multiplex enzymatic assay performed from a single DBS punch was able to discriminate presumed normal from known affected samples for 5 LSDs. Conclusions: Digital microfluidic technology shows potential for rapid, high-throughput screening for 5 LSDs in a newborn screening laboratory environment. Sample preparation to enzymatic activity on each cartridge is less than 3 h.},

The sampling points were at the water source (S), the treatment plant outlet (TPO), and at the nearest houses (H1) and the furthest houses (H2) from the TPO.

However, Al concentrations in all public water supply estates were well within the limit except for one estate. The pH for all samples complied with the NSDWQ except from the private estates for the drinking water supply with an acidic pH (5.50 {\textpm} 0.90). The private water supply showed violated turbidity value in the drinking water samples (14.2 {\textpm} 24.1 NTU). Insufficient amount of chlorination was observed in the private water supply estates (0.09 {\textpm} 0.30\,mg/L). Private water supplies with inefficient water treatment served unsatisfactory drinking water quality to the community which may lead to major health problems.},

  abstract = {The design of novel food micro-structures aimed at the quality, health and pleasure markets will probably require unit operations where the scale of the forming device is closer to the size of the structural elements (i.e., 1--100 {$\mu$}m). One emerging possibility is microfluidics or devices that employ small amounts of fluids (10-6 to 10-9 l) flowing in channels where at least one dimension is less than 1 mm. However, under these conditions, the predominant effects are not necessarily those present in conventional macroscopic unit operations. Dominant physical effects at the microfluidic scale are introduced through the use of dimensionless numbers. Different types of geometries to generate multi-phase flows in micro-channels, techniques and materials to construct the micro-devices, principally soft lithography and laser ablation, as well as methods used to modify surface properties of channels, are reviewed. The operation of micro-devices, the role of flow regimes, rheological behaviour of fluids in micro-channels and of transient time is discussed. Finally, systems developed to generate emulsions and foams, fluid mixing and dispersion, and future applications of these devices in food processing and food analysis are presented.},

  abstract = {Marangoni bursting describes the spontaneous spread of a droplet of a binary mixture of alcohol/water deposited on a bath of oil, followed by its fast spontaneous fragmentation into a large number of smaller droplets in a self-similar way. Several papers have aimed to describe the physical phenomena underlying this spectacular phenomenon, in which two opposite effects, solutal and thermal Marangoni stresses, play competitive roles. We performed investigations of the Marangoni bursting phenomenon, paying attention to the surface temperature changes during bursting and after it. Fragmentation instabilities were monitored using a thermal camera for various initial alcohol/water compositions and at different stages of the process. We uncovered the role of thermocapillary Marangoni flows within the more viscous oil phase that are responsible for outward and inward shrinking of the periphery circle at the final stage of the phenomenon, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the thermal Marangoni effect. Simulations of the Marangoni thermocapillary effect in an oil bath by solving coupled Navier--Stokes and heat transport equations using the COMSOL Multiphysics software platform support our experimental observations.},

  abstract = {We present a method for the development of paper-based electrochemical sensors for detection of heavy metals in water samples. Contaminated water leads to serious health problems and environmental issues. Paper is ideally suited for point-of-care testing, as it is low cost, disposable, and multi-functional. Initial sensor designs were manufactured on paper substrates using combinations of inkjet printing and screen printing technologies using silver and carbon inks. Bismuth onion-like carbon nanoparticle ink was manufactured and used as the active material of the sensor for both commercial and paper-based sensors, which were compared using standard electrochemical analysis techniques. The results highlight the potential of paper-based sensors to be used effectively for rapid water quality monitoring at the point-of-need.},

  abstract = {The current practice of designing microfluidic Lab-on-a-Chip (LoCs) limits reusing designs and makes sharing tasks among researchers difficult. One way to achieve that objective is to borrow best practices from engineering. Also it takes a lot of skills to design LoCs. Design-by-assembly in which a LoC can be designed by configuring, laying out subsystems can help new researchers to develop custom chips. Flexible, reusable, and rapid-prototyping-feasible LoC designs can be achieved by fabricated modular microfluidic blocks. However, challenging problems still persist, which limit the usefulness of prefabricated blocks. We propose software microfluidic modules (SoftMABs) based design technique to solve issues fabricated modules face. By configuring SoftMABs, integrating them, the new assembly of SoftMABs can form a 3D LoC design ready to be prototyped. The proposed method can make designing a complex LoC less challenging, and collaborating among laboratories easier. We created SoftMABs and designed a custom microfluidic chip by assembling SoftMABs like LEGOs, dragging-and-dropping them. Later we reconfigured them - by replacing a SoftMAB with another module - to make a new LoC. We believe this computeraided method is an interesting and useful LoC design technique.},

Crossreference scheme, which allows single-layer electrode fabrication for 2D droplet movement consist of both top and bottom substrate each consist of orthogonally aligned parallel electrode assembly in the XY-plane. The present work focuses on simulation of driving force in the cross-reference design using 3D voltage distribution plots obtained through AC-DC module of COMSOL Multiphysics software. The cross-reference scheme is not only easy to fabricate but also does not compromise with system performance as in the case of classical scheme due to large electrode gap. For simulation, a 3 x 3 array of electrode has been considered for 2D droplet motion by actuating inner electrodes. Voltage distribution across different layers has been calculated from field distribution plot and used in energy based model for estimating actuation force during droplet transition.},

Electrodes are diagonally connected with one external pin to the voltage supply. Each electrode-pad is made by carving (or cutting) out two triangular sections from the sides and adding two triangular sections on the top and bottom of the traditional square electrode. This modification in electrode shape creates an imbalance of electromechanical force at the three-phase contact line on applying the supply voltage to the actuating electrode. Droplet moves towards either horizontal or vertical directions depending on the direction of the dominant force. The scheme requires a single layer of metal thin film deposition for device fabrication and also reduces the number of external pin connections to the power supply.},

Next, synthesized nanocomposite thin film of BST/Teflon{\textregistered} AF is coated on the coplanar electrodes to act as both dielectric and hydrophobic layer. Experiments show that change in electrode dimension (or shape), such as electrode length (L), gap (G) and no. of teeth (T) result different contact line (CL) between the droplet and the actuated electrode. This leads to change in VT for droplet transport. It is found that higher contact line results in lower threshold voltage, while lower contact line results in higher threshold voltage.

We report a novel paper-based single input channel microfluidic device that can detect more than one whole-cell foodborne bacteria at the same time, and comes with quantitative reading via image analysis. This microfluidic paper-based multiplexed aptasensor simultaneously detects E. coli O157:H7 and S. Typhimurium. Custom designed particles provide colorimetric signal enhancement and false results prevention. Several aptamers were screened and the highest-affinity aptamers were optimized and employed for detection of these bacteria in solution, both in a buffer as well as pear juice. Image analysis was used to read and quantify the colorimetric signal and measure bacteria concentration, thus rendering this paper based microfluidic device quantitative. The colorimetric results show linearity over a wide concentration range (102 CFU/mL to 108 CFU/mL) and a limit of detection (LOD) of 103 CFU/mL and 102 CFU/mL for E. coli O157:H7 and S. Typhimurium, respectively. An insignificant change in colorimetric response for non-target bacteria indicates the aptasesnors are specific. The reported multiplexed colorimetric paper-based microfluidic devices is likely to perform well for on-site rapid screening of pathogenic bacteria in water and food products.},

Recently, a microfluidic approach has been introduced to generate all-aqueous emulsions and jets based on these immiscible aqueous phases; due to their biocompatibility, these all-aqueous structures have shown great promises as templates for fabricating biomaterials. The physico-chemical nature of interfaces between two immiscible aqueous phases leads to unique interfacial properties, such as an ultra-low interfacial tension. Strategies to manipulate components and direct their assembly at these interfaces needs to be explored. In this paper, we review progress on the topic over the past few years, with a focus on the fabrication and stabilization of all-aqueous structures in a multiphase microfluidic platform. We also discuss future efforts needed from the perspectives of fluidic physics, materials engineering, and biology for fulfilling potential applications ranging from materials fabrication to biomedical engineering.},

  abstract = {Nanozymes are synthetic nanoparticulate materials that mimic the biological activities of enzymes by virtue of their surface chemistry. Enzymes catalyze biological reactions with a very high degree of specificity. Examples include the horseradish peroxidase, lactate, glucose, and cholesterol oxidases. For this reason, many industrial uses of enzymes outside their natural environments have been developed. Similar to enzymes, many industrial applications of nanozymes have been developed and used. Unlike the enzymes, however, nanozymes are cost-effectively prepared, purified, stored, and reproducibly and repeatedly used for long periods of time. The detection and identification of pathogens is among some of the reported applications of nanozymes. Three of the methodologic milestones in the evolution of pathogen detection and identification include the incubation and growth, immunoassays and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) strategies. Although advances in the history of pathogen detection and identification have given rise to novel methods and devices, these are still short of the response speed, accuracy and cost required for point-of-care use. Debuting recently, nanozymology offers significant improvements in the six methodological indicators that are proposed as being key in this review, including simplicity, sensitivity, speed of response, cost, reliability, and durability of the immunoassays and PCR strategies. This review will focus on the applications of nanozymes in the detection and identification of pathogens in samples obtained from foods, natural, and clinical sources. It will highlight the impact of nanozymes in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent and PCR strategies by discussing the mechanistic improvements and the role of the design and architecture of the nanozyme nanoconjugates. Because of their contribution to world health burden, the three most important pathogens that will be considered include viruses, bacteria and fungi. Although not quite seen as pathogens, the review will also consider the detection of cancer cells and helminth parasites. The review leaves very little doubt that nanozymology has introduced remarkable advances in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and PCR strategies for detecting these five classes of pathogens. However, a gap still exists in the application of nanozymes to detect and identify fungal pathogens directly, although indirect strategies in which nanozymes are used have been reported. From a mechanistic point of view, the nanozyme technology transfer to laboratory research methods in PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay studies, and the point-of-care devices such as electronic biosensors and lateral flow detection strips, that is currently taking place, is most likely to give rise to no small revolution in each of the six methodological indicators for pathogen detection and identification. While the evidence of widespread research reports, clinical trials and point-of-care device patents support this view, the gaps that still exist point to a need for more basic research studies to be conducted on the applications of nanozymology in pathogen detection and identification. The multidisciplinary nature of the research on the application of nanozymes in the detection and identification of pathogens requires chemists and physicists for the design, fabrication, and characterization of nanozymes; microbiologists for the design, testing and analysis of the methodologies, and clinicians or clinical researchers for the evaluation of the methodologies and devices in the clinic. Many reports have also implicated required skills in mathematical modelling, and electronic engineering. While the review will conclude with a synopsis of the impact of nanozymology on the detection and identification of viruses, bacteria, fungi, cancer cells, and helminths, it will also point out opportunities that exist in basic research as well as opportunities for innovation aimed at novel laboratory methodologies and devices. In this regard there is no doubt that there are numerous unexplored research areas in the application of nanozymes for the detection of pathogens. For example, most research on the applications of nanozymes for the detection and identification of fungi is so far limited only to the detection of mycotoxins and other chemical compounds associated with fungal infection. Therefore, there is scope for exploration of the application of nanozymes in the direct detection of fungi in foods, especially in the agricultural production thereof. Many fungal species found in seeds severely compromise their use by inactivating the germination thereof. Fungi also produce mycotoxins that can severely compromise the health of humans if consumed.},

  abstract = {Indium tin oxide (ITO)-based digital microfluidics (DMF) with unique optical and electrical properties are promising in the development of integrated, automatic and portable analytical systems. The fabrication technique using laser direct etching (LDE) on ITO glass has the advantages of being rapid, low cost and convenient. However, the fabrication resolution of LDE limits the minimum line width for patterns on ITO glasses, leading to a related wider lead wire for the actuating electrodes of DMF compared with photolithography. Therefore, the lead wire of electrodes could affect the droplet motion on the digital microfluidic chip due to the increased contact line with the droplet. Herein, we developed a finite element model of a DMF with improved efficiency to investigate the effect of the lead wire. An optimized electrode pattern was then designed based on a theoretical analysis and validated by a simulation, which significantly decreased the deformation of the droplets down to 0.012 mm. The performance of the optimized electrode was also verified in an experiment. The proposed simulation method could be further extended to other DMF systems or applications to provide an efficient approach for the design and optimization of DMF chips.},

The planar design of interdigital microelectrodes not only shortens the ionic diffusion distance but also enables the direct integration of the device on-chip or on a flexible substrate for various applications. Graphene, with a unique 2-D nanostructure, has been extensively studied as a supercapacitor material with superior charge storage capability. Recently, the progress in thin-film fabrication technologies has facilitated the development of graphene-based MSCs, which results in device miniaturization and improved areal capacitance. This paper reviews the recent advances on the design of graphene-based MSCs and discusses the technical trend regarding large-scale fabrication and stretchable/wearable energy storage devices.},

  abstract = {In order to fabricate a digital microfluidic (DMF) chip, which requires a patterned array of electrodes coated with a dielectric film, we explored two simple methods: Ballpoint pen printing to generate the electrodes, and wrapping of a dielectric plastic film to coat the electrodes. For precise and programmable printing of the patterned electrodes, we used a digital plotter with a ballpoint pen filled with a silver nanoparticle (AgNP) ink. Instead of using conventional material deposition methods, such as chemical vapor deposition, printing, and spin coating, for fabricating the thin dielectric layer, we used a simple method in which we prepared a thin dielectric layer using pre-made linear, low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) plastic (17-{\textmu}m thick) by simple wrapping. We then sealed it tightly with thin silicone oil layers so that it could be used as a DMF chip. Such a treated dielectric layer showed good electrowetting performance for a sessile drop without contact angle hysteresis under an applied voltage of less than 170 V. By using this straightforward fabrication method, we quickly and affordably fabricated a paper-based DMF chip and demonstrated the digital electrofluidic actuation and manipulation of drops.},

  abstract = {Recent advanced paper-based microfluidic devices provide an alternative technology for the detection of biomarkers by using affordable and portable devices for point-of-care testing (POCT). Programmable paper-based microfluidic devices enable a wide range of biomarker detection with high sensitivity and automation for single- and multi-step assays because they provide better control for manipulating fluid samples. In this review, we examine the advances in programmable microfluidics, i.e., paper-based continuous-flow microfluidic (p-CMF) devices and paper-based digital microfluidic (p-DMF) devices, for biomarker detection. First, we discuss the methods used to fabricate these two types of paper-based microfluidic devices and the strategies for programming fluid delivery and for droplet manipulation. Next, we discuss the use of these programmable paper-based devices for the single- and multi-step detection of biomarkers. Finally, we present the current limitations of paper-based microfluidics for biomarker detection and the outlook for their development.},

While conventional methods often require complicated workflows, costly reagents, lab equipment, and are time-consuming, rendering them inadequate for field~testing and low-resource settings. Increased attention has been drawn to developing alternative low-cost and rapid methods to detect on-site live pathogens in different environmental matrices. Among them, microfluidic devices that integrate various laboratory functions in a miniaturized manner have proven to be a promising tool for the rapid and sensitive detection of pathogens. Herein, the development of microfluidic devices specifically designed for the detection of live pathogens is discussed along a concise summary of novel microfluidics~systems recently developed, contrasted to conventional methods regarding assay time, the limit of detection, and target organisms. These include a variety of micro total analysis systems ({\textmu}TAS) and microfluidic paper-based analytical devices ({\textmu}PADs) in combination with molecular methods and traditional live cell detection techniques, such as cell culture, DNA intercalating dyes, resazurin, and immobilized bioreceptors (e.g., aptamers and capture antibodies). Furthermore, insights on the future perspectives of microfluidics for live pathogen detection with a highlight on the rapid and low-cost method development for field testing are provided.},

Although the effectiveness of this technique has been widely demonstrated for applications based on micrometer-sized particles, the manipulation and focusing of sub-micrometer ones is challenging due to the presence of acoustic streaming.~In this article, our study has the aim to investigate and understand which geometrical parameters could be changed to limit the acoustic streaming effect. We numerically study the well-known rectangular cross section of a microfluidic channel and perform a parametric study of the aspect ratio for several particle sizes. The efficiency of the focusing, is explored for different sized particles in order to identify a trend for which the acoustic streaming does not drastically influence the focusing motion of the particles. The possibility to efficiently separate different solid components in liquid suspensions, i.e. the whole blood, is crucial for all applications that require a purified medium such as plasmapheresis or an increase of the concentration of specific subpopulation as the outcome, such as proteomics, cancer biomarker detections and extracellular vesicles separation.},

  abstract = {This work introduces a fibre-optic sensing architecture for digital microfluidic devices. The fibre-optic sensing architecture relies on a change in the total internal reflection angle to detect the presence of microdroplets in contact with fibre-optic cables through lowered optical transmission. The architecture uses m parallel column fibre-optic cables orthogonally overlapped with n parallel row fibre-optic cables to provide the Cartesian coordinates of multiple microdroplets. This creates m {\texttimes} n microdroplet sensing positions, for high localization, with only m + n measurement points, for practical implementation. The contact times of advancing and receding microdroplets are measured using an experimental configuration of the architecture. These contact times are found to be within the acceptable time limitations for high-speed operation of the digital microfluidic device. Ultimately, the fibre-optic sensing architecture is experimentally demonstrated as a three by three architecture for the localization of multiple microdroplets.},

This technology enables the researchers to realize highly reliable and rapid detection and screening applications in various fields. The high-throughput nature of droplet microfluidics generates large amounts of valuable but complex droplet dataset. Deeper analysis of this intricate droplet data is very essential for detection, classification, characterization and quantification of reactions/content inside the droplets. This can be carried out by Machine Learning (ML), which has proven itself in processing and providing deeper insights and precise predictions of relatively large amounts of complex data with shorter analysis times and exceptional accuracy. The analytical tools of ML enable to imbibe automation and control of many such diagnostic platforms, including DBMF, with minimum human intervention. In recent times, the potential of ML has been explored in microfluidic technology as well to tackle challenges in biomedical and biotechnological applications. The synergy of both the fields, DBMF and ML, helps in development of optimized and automated tools with higher accuracy for numerous applications. Specifically, this enables complete comprehension of the field to eventually realize a truly microfluidic total analysis system ({\textmu}TAS). This work comprehends a general review emphasizing the implementation of different ML models with DBMF to automate various activities such as fluid control, droplet size prediction, recognition of flow pattern and identification, classification and sorting of droplets in a microfluidic device.},

Because health care costs are increasing, there is an increasing need to remotely monitor the health condition of patients by point-of-care-testing. The demand for biosensors for detection of biological warfare agents has increased, and research is focused on ways of producing small portable devices that would allow fast, accurate, and on-site detection. In the past decade, the demand for rapid and accurate on-site detection of plant disease diagnosis has increased due to emerging pathogens with resistance to pesticides, increased human mobility, and regulations limiting the application of toxic chemicals to prevent spread of diseases. The portability of biosensors for onsite diagnosis is limited due to various issues, including sample preparation techniques, fluid-handling techniques, the limited lifetime of biological reagents, device packaging, integrating electronics for data collection/analysis, and the requirement of external accessories and power. Many microfluidic, electronic, and biological design strategies, such as handling liquids in biosensors without pumps/valves, the application of droplet-based microfluidics, paper-based microfluidic devices, and wireless networking capabilities for data transmission, are being explored.},

  abstract = {Electrochemistry combined with economical and sustainable platforms (such as paper) provides portable, affordable, robust, and user-friendly devices. In general, techniques, such as photolithography and sputtering, are excellent alternatives for producing these platforms. However, owing to the requirement of expensive and sophisticated instrumentation, as well as cleanroom facilities, these techniques have limited access. Thus, the search for easy to use and produce approaches have been reported, using consumables, including adhesives, carbon ink, graphite, pencil, office paper, paperboard, among others. In this sense, in this mini-review, we discuss various strategies explored to fabricate low-cost electrochemical sensors, including its main applications. Different manufacturing methods, such as screen and stencil printing, laser-scribing, and pencil drawing, will be discussed here, emphasizing the performance of the obtained devices, in addition to their advantages and disadvantages.},

They allow for handling small amounts of samples and reagents on a circuit board and, thus, automatically execute medical experiments that are usually conducted manually in laboratories. However, there are various challenges in the design of DMFBs. Issues such as routing and layouting are complex and currently being investigated by various researchers and engineers. Although first automatic solutions assist them, the obtained results are usually provided in a complex and non-intuitive fashion. This makes the utilization and evaluation of existing approaches for DMFB design a tedious task. In this paper, we present a solution for this problem by proposing a visualization scheme for DMFBs that explicitly addresses these problems. To this end, a grammar is proposed which allows the description of resulting designs and their properties. The contributions of this work allow for a design methodology which is easy to use and provides a hassle-free environment for the involved researchers and engineers.},

We present a poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) microdevice where on-board infrared-mediated PCR amplification is seamlessly integrated with a particle-based, visual DNA detection for specific detection of bacterial targets in less than 35 minutes. Fluidic control is achieved using a capillary burst valve laser-ablated in a novel manner to confine the PCR reagents to a chamber during thermal cycling, and a manual torque-actuated pressure system to mobilize the fluid from the PCR chamber to the detection reservoir containing oligonucleotide-adducted magnetic particles. Interaction of amplified products specific to the target organism with the beads in a rotating magnetic field allows for near instantaneous ({$<$}30 s) detection based on hybridization-induced aggregation (HIA) of the particles and simple optical analysis. The integration of PCR with this rapid, sequence-specific DNA detection method on a single microdevice presents the possibility of creating POC NAT systems that are low cost, easy-to-use, and involve minimal external hardware.},

  abstract = {Review on miniaturization, integration, and automation of laboratory processes within centrifugal microfluidic platforms. For efficient implementation of applications, building blocks are categorized into unit operations and process chains.           ,              Centrifugal microfluidics has evolved into a mature technology. Several major diagnostic companies either have products on the market or are currently evaluating centrifugal microfluidics for product development. The fields of application are widespread and include clinical chemistry, immunodiagnostics and protein analysis, cell handling, molecular diagnostics, as well as food, water, and soil analysis. Nevertheless, new fluidic functions and applications that expand the possibilities of centrifugal microfluidics are being introduced at a high pace. In this review, we first present an up-to-date comprehensive overview of centrifugal microfluidic unit operations. Then, we introduce the term ``process chain'' to review how these unit operations can be combined for the automation of laboratory workflows. Such aggregation of basic functionalities enables efficient fluidic design at a higher level of integration. Furthermore, we analyze how novel, ground-breaking unit operations may foster the integration of more complex applications. Among these are the storage of pneumatic energy to realize complex switching sequences or to pump liquids radially inward, as well as the complete pre-storage and release of reagents. In this context, centrifugal microfluidics provides major advantages over other microfluidic actuation principles: the pulse-free inertial liquid propulsion provided by centrifugal microfluidics allows for closed fluidic systems that are free of any interfaces to external pumps. Processed volumes are easily scalable from nanoliters to milliliters. Volume forces can be adjusted by rotation and thus, even for very small volumes, surface forces may easily be overcome in the centrifugal gravity field which enables the efficient separation of nanoliter volumes from channels, chambers or sensor matrixes as well as the removal of any disturbing bubbles. In summary, centrifugal microfluidics takes advantage of a comprehensive set of fluidic unit operations such as liquid transport, metering, mixing and valving. The available unit operations cover the entire range of automated liquid handling requirements and enable efficient miniaturization, parallelization, and integration of assays.},

Due to the NP-complete nature of the problem, we also develop efficient heuristic procedures to solve this optimization problem. We apply the proposed concurrent testing methodology to a droplet-based microfluidic array that was fabricated and used to perform multiplexed glucose and lactate assays. Experimental results show that the proposed test approach interleaves test application with the biomedical assays and prevents resource conflicts. The proposed method is therefore directed at ensuring high reliability and availability of bio-MEMS and lab-on-a-chip systems, as they are increasingly deployed for safety-critical applications.},

The preparation of DMF is then described, including material selection, fabrication techniques and droplet generation. Subsequently, a comprehensive account of advancements in the integration of DMF with various immunoassay techniques is offered, encompassing colorimetric, direct chemiluminescence, enzymatic chemiluminescence, electrosensory, and other immunoassays.

Current techniques for full-custom design of droplet-based ``digital'' biochips do not scale well for concurrent assays and for next-generation system-on-chip (SOC) designs that are expected to include microfluidic components. We propose a system design methodology that attempts to apply classical high-level synthesis techniques to the design of digital microfluidic biochips. We focus here on the problem of scheduling bioassay functions under resource constraints. We first develop an optimal scheduling strategy based on integer linear programming. However, because the scheduling problem is NP-complete, we also develop two heuristic techniques that scale well for large problem instances. A clinical diagnostic procedure, namely multiplexed in-vitro diagnostics on human physiological fluids, is first used to illustrate and evaluate the proposed method. Next, the synthesis approach is applied to a protein assay, which serves as a more complex bioassay application. The proposed synthesis approach is expected to reduce human effort and design cycle time, and it will facilitate the integration of microfluidic components with microelectronic components in next-generation SOCs.},

There are six environmental data were used in this study such as pH, total suspended solids (TSS), dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), and ammonia. The data was obtained by in-site measurement and laboratory analysis. Then, the data was used as the feeder of input variables in the ANN database system. After training and testing the network of ANN, the result showed that 80.0\% of accuracy classification with 0.468 of root mean square error (RMSE).

  abstract = {Microfluidics-based biochips are soon expected to revolutionize clinical diagnosis, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing, and other laboratory procedures involving molecular biology. In contrast to continuous-flow systems that rely on permanently etched microchannels, micropumps, and microvalves, digital microfluidics offers a scalable system architecture and dynamic reconfigurability; groups of unit cells in a microfluidics array can be reconfigured to change their functionality during the concurrent execution of a set of bioassays. As more bioassays are executed concurrently on a biochip, system integration and design complexity are expected to increase dramatically. This paper presents an overview of an integrated system-level design methodology that attempts to address key issues in the synthesis, testing and reconfiguration of digital microfluidics-based biochips. Different actuation mechanisms for microfluidics-based biochips, and associated design-automation trends and challenges are also discussed. The proposed top-down design-automation approach is expected to relieve biochip users from the burden of manual optimization of bioassays, time-consuming hardware design, and costly testing and maintenance procedures, and it will facilitate the integration of fluidic components with a microelectronic component in next-generation systems-on-chips (SOCs).},

ARCs are micro-sized periodic semicircular hydrophilic regions on a hydrophobic background, providing anisotropic wettability. SiNx and Cytop are used as the dielectric layer between the water droplet and working electrodes. By adopting parylene as a stencil mask, hydrophilic patterning on the hydrophobic Cytop thin film layer is achieved without the loss of Cytop hydrophobicity. While the traditional EWOD platform requires the control of multiple electrodes to transport the droplet, our system utilizes only two controlling electrodes. We demonstrate that 15 ll water droplets are transported at a speed of 13 mm/s under 60 Vpeak sinusoid AC signal at 50 Hz. Droplet transport at 20 Hz is also presented, demonstrating that the system can operate within a range of frequencies.},

They can move easily across either solid or liquid surfaces since the hydrophobic particles protect the internal liquid from contacting the substrate. In recent years, mainly due to their simple preparation, abundant materials, non-wetting/non-adhesive properties, elasticities and stabilities, LMs have been applied in many fields such as microfluidics, sensors and biological incubators. In this review, the recent advances in the preparation, physical properties and applications of liquid marbles, especially operations and floating abilities, are summarized. Moreover, the challenges to achieve uniformity, slow volatilization and stronger stability are pointed out. Various applications generated by LMs' structural characteristics are also expected.},

Droplet characteristics including droplet size, volume, and dispersity, as well as droplet intensity, have been measured, showing the potential of this device to analyze droplet-based assays. Most importantly, in addition to learning the knowledge and principles from classroom lectures, students can thus gain practice of using an advanced, state-of-the-art technology in a laboratory course.

The diversity and complexity of food matrices pose great challenges for rapid and ultra-sensitive detection of S. typhimurium in food samples. A method capable of identification, detection, and quantification of S. typhimurium is essential for addressing these issues. In this study, aptamer-coated magnetic beads (Apt-MBs) are employed as capture bio-probes to specifically and selectively concentrate S. typhimurium in food samples. A self-priming chip-based digital PCR was then presented as another biosensor for on-site detection and quantification of S. typhimurium cells. The chip we developed was robust and did not require any external power for sample loading. The combination of Apt-MBs with an on-chip digital detection realized the integration into lab-on-a-chip-based biosensors for on-site monitoring of foodborne pathogens. It was possible to capture and detect S. typhimurium cells as low as 90 CFU/reaction with a capture efficiency of 94.5\%. Additionally, the whole process only took about 2 h. This unique platform could also be used to monitor other target bacteria with high specificity and sensitivity by utilizing different aptamers. Furthermore, the platform has potential applications in point-of-care testing in the future.},

The technology had already been successful in automatic identification, tracking, and tracing applications such as logistics, clothing, agriculture, food, manufacturing, etc. Research towards sensing applications has started, and they are in the stage of experimental demonstration and industrial deployment. The main focus of this review is to provide a piece of detailed information about RFID technology and its diverse applications together in one platform with an extensive literature survey. Beginning with the evolution of RFID; comparing the RFID technology with wired and Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) with different attributes; understanding the different protocols used in wireless sensor technologies; the working principle of RFID - based on near-field and far-field communication, chipped and chipless tags, are briefly discussed with illustrations. The diverse applications of RFID technology are addressed with their quantifying measuring parameters, and the technical challenges involved in each application are also discussed wherever required. The main RFID applications include agriculture, aviation, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), biomedical, food/chemical, and some unique/emerging applications are presented under the miscellaneous category. Finally, we proposed a generalized methodology for intelligent condition monitoring using RFID technology and Machine Learning (ML) approach to improve fault diagnosis accuracy, classification, and prediction without human intervention.},

  abstract = {In aquaculture industry, fish, shellfish, and aquatic plants are cultivated in fresh, salt, or brackish waters. The increasing demand of aquatic products has stimulated the rapid growth of aquaculture industries. How to effectively monitor and control water quality is one of the key concerns for aquaculture industry to ensure high productivity and high quality. There are four major categories of water quality concerns that affect aquaculture cultivations, namely, (1) physical parameters, e.g., pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and salinity, (2) organic contaminants, (3) biochemical hazards, e.g., cyanotoxins, and (4) biological contaminants, i.e., pathogens. While the physical parameters are affected by climate changes, the latter three are considered as environmental factors. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of sensors, biosensors, and analytical technologies available for monitoring aquaculture water quality. They include low-cost commercial sensors and sensor network setups for physical parameters. They also include chromatography, mass spectrometry, biochemistry, and molecular methods (e.g., immunoassays and polymerase chain reaction assays), culture-based method, and biophysical technologies (e.g., biosensors and nanosensors) for environmental contamination factors. According to the different levels of sophistication of various analytical techniques and the information they can provide (either fine fingerprint, highly accurate quantification, semiquantification, qualitative detection, or fast screening), we will comment on how they may be used as complementary tools, as well as their potential and gaps toward current demand of real-time, online, and/or onsite detection.},

  abstract = {Microfluidics-based biochips are soon expected to revolutionize biosensing, clinical diagnostics and drug discovery. Robust off-line and on-line test techniques are required to ensure system dependability as these biochips are deployed for safety-critical applications. Due to the underlying mixed-technology and mixed-energy domains, biochips exhibit unique failure mechanisms and defects. We first relate some realistic defects to fault models and observable errors. We next set up an experiment to evaluate the manifestations of electrode-short faults. Motivated by the experimental results, we present a testing and diagnosis methodology to detect catastrophic faults and locate faulty regions. The proposed method is evaluated using a biochip performing real-life multiplexed bioassays.},

  abstract = {Ion-selective electrode (ISE) membranes with a solid contact rather than a traditional liquid inner contact are anticipated to give lower detection limits because of diminished ion fluxes. Often, however, ill-defined solid contacts give rise to instabilities and interferences by oxygen gas. Here, a poly(methyl methacrylate)/poly(decyl methacrylate) (MMA/DMA) copolymer as membrane matrix was solvent-cast on a layer of poly(n-octyl)thiophene (POT) deposited on Au as internal contact. The resulting Ca2+- and Pb2+-selective electrodes were not sensitive to O2 and no evidence was found for the presence of a water film between membrane and internal contact. On the other hand, a water film was present when electropolymerized poly(n-octyl)thiophene was used. In the absence of a conducting polymer, O2 induced a significant change in the EMF but no clear evidence was found for a water film between POT and the MMA/DMA membrane. The lower detection limit of the new Au-POT-MMA/DMA solid-contact electrodes was somewhat better than that observed with a corresponding liquid-contact ISE and reached subnanomolar levels. Importantly, the response times for the solid-contact ISE are, at low concentrations, much faster than for the liquid-contact ISE.},

Various magnetic forces have been employed for the migration, orientation, manipulation, and trapping of microparticles, and new analytical platforms for separating and detecting molecules have been proposed. Magnetic materials such as functional magnetic nanoparticles, magnetic nanocomposites, and specially designed magnetic solids and liquids have also been developed for analytical purposes. Numerous attractive applications of magnetic and electromagnetic forces on magnetic and non-magnetic materials have been studied, but fundamental studies to understand the working principles of magnetic forces have been challenging. These studies will form a new field of magneto-analytical science, which should be developed as an interdisciplinary field. In this review, essential pioneering works and recent attractive developments are presented.},

In general, microchannels have been used to deliver the samples of interest to these microcoils; however, these systems tend to have large dead volumes and require more complex fluidic connections. Here, we introduce a two-plate digital microfluidic (DMF) strategy to interface small-volume samples with NMR microcoils. In this system, a planar microcoil is surrounded by a copper plane that serves as the counter-electrode for the digital microfluidic device, allowing for precise control of droplet position and shape. This feature allows for the user-determination of the orientation of droplets relative to the main axes of the shim stack, permitting improved shimming and a more homogeneous magnetic field inside the droplet below the microcoil, which leads to improved spectral lineshape. This, along with high-fidelity droplet actuation, allows for rapid shimming strategies (developed over decades for vertically oriented NMR tubes) to be employed, permitting the determination of reaction-product diffusion coefficients as well as quantitative monitoring of reactive intermediates. We propose that this system paves the way for new and exciting applications for               in situ               analysis of small samples by NMR spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {In digital microfluidics, discrete droplets of fluid are made to move on an open surface with no microchannels. These systems are commonly operated by application of electrical driving forces to an array of electrodes. While these driving forces are well characterized, the dissipative forces opposing droplet movement have not been as thoroughly examined. In recognition of this deficit, we used force- velocity plots to characterize droplet movement in digital microfluidics, which was found to be consistent with a simple theoretical framework for understanding dissipation effects for droplets in two-plate, air-filled devices. Interestingly, in some conditions, a previously unreported {${''}$}velocity saturation{${''}$} effect was observed. When examined across a range of different liquids, the forces at which this saturation occurs seem to be lower for liquids with smaller surface tensions. Furthermore, when driven at forces that cause saturation, physical phenomena are observed that are akin to what has been reported for stationary droplets in the electrowetting literature. These phenomena are detrimental to device performance, leading to a new ``force window'' approach that delineates the optimum operation conditions for different liquids. We propose that these findings may be useful for a wide range of applications for experts and new users alike in this growing field.},

The sensors were designed to have different configurations and were constructed on different substrates. The substrate variation was used to investigate the effect of substrate properties on sensing performance. The first design was fabricated on a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) material made from a FR4 fiberglass; the second sensor design was fabricated using thick film on alumina. The third sensor was designed using thin-film [microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)] technology and was fabricated on a glass substrate. The performances of the sensors were evaluated for different configurations of the electrode structures as well as dielectric materials. Initial experiments have been conducted to analyze the sensor's performance with two peptide derivatives, namely, Sarcosine and Proline. These peptides are closely related to the target molecule of domoic acid, a natural toxin in seafood. Experiments with endotoxin have been presented and the possibility of extending the sensors for detection of chemicals responsible for food poisoning has been discussed. Initial investigation on the sensors' performance based on Impedance Spectroscopy method is reported in this paper.},

Electrochemical approaches show increasing potential to fill this role as advancements in nanotechnology continually improve analytical performance and on-site applicability. However, translating these improvements into the field still faces the resonating challenges of reaching analytical proficiency (selectivity, sensitivity, robustness, stability), practical end-user functionality, minimal matrix interferences and cost effectiveness. Herein, we elaborate on these challenges via a critical evaluation of current studies and examine how realistic the prospects of on-site nitrate, nitrite and ammonium are.

  abstract = {Miniaturizing the traditional wet lab processes and realizing the full potential of lab-on-a-chip technology (LOC) has been a great challenges for scientists and engineers in the quest of providing health care where such does not exists, or to increase lab efficiency and lower the operational cost. A range of practical LOC fabrication technologies has already been demonstrated, and as a result, the research of real life applications has been steadily increasing. However, due to the variety of used technologies and LOC form factors, it often requires a modification or even a complete redesign of the available instrumentation systems. Standardization and flexible instrumentation has seen limited development in the LOC field even though developing on all application levels has been proven as an effective way to stimulate a growth in a research field. To address this, we present a modular digital microfluidics (DMF) instrumentation platform and a concept of integrated chip-instrument co-design that has the potential to solve a wide range of LOC instrumentation challenges.},

This work proposes the use of such hardware for security purposes through the randomization of checkpoints in both space and time, and provides design guidelines for designers of such systems. We define security metrics and present techniques for improving performance through static checkpoint maps, and describe performance trade-offs associated with static and random checkpoints. We also provide detailed classification of attack models and demonstrate the feasibility of our techniques with case studies on assays implemented in typical DMFB hardware.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs)---an emerging technology that implements bioassays through manipulation of discrete fluid droplets---are vulnerable to actuation tampering attacks, where a malicious adversary modifies control signals for the purposes of manipulating results or causing denial-of-service. Such attacks leverage the highly programmable nature of DMFBs. However, practical DMFBs often employ a technique called pin mapping to reduce control pin count while simultaneously reducing the degrees of freedom available for droplet manipulation. Attempts to control specific electrodes as part of an attack cannot be made without inadvertently actuating other electrodes on-chip, which makes the tampering evident. This paper explores this tamperresistance property of pin mapping in detail. We derive relevant security metrics, evaluate the tamper-resistance of several existing pin mapping algorithms, and propose a new security-aware pin mapper with superior tamper-resistance as compared to prior work.},

Since electrochemical sensors are required to be of very high sensitivity, selectivity and stability, incorporation of nanomaterials in the sensors' design is inevitable due to their aforementioned properties. So many work have therefore been reported in which nanomaterials ranging from nanoparticles to nanotubes were used for improving the properties of sensors and the results of these researches have been so far promising.

The droplet breakup occurs at a fixed point due to the focused velocity gradient created by the nozzle shape geometry. The system not only creates monodispersed primary droplets with sizes controlled by the applied flow rates, but also generates monodispersed submicron droplets.

Despite significant advances, it remains challenging to achieve repeatability, high speed, and simple circuitry in EWOD-based droplet manipulation on superhydrophobic surfaces. Moreover, its efficient operation typically requires electrode arrays and sophisticated circuit control. Here, a newly observed droplet manipulation phenomenon on superhydrophobic surfaces with orbital EWOD (OEW) is reported. Due to the asymmetric electrowetting force generated on the orbit, flexible and versatile droplet manipulation is facilitated with OEW. It is demonstrated that OEW droplet manipulation on superhydrophobic surfaces exhibits higher speed (up to 5 times faster), enhanced functionality (antigravity), and manipulation of diverse liquids (acid, base, salt, organic, e.g., methyl blue, artificial blood) without contamination, and good durability after 1000 tests. It is envisioned that this robust droplet manipulation strategy using OEW will provide a valuable platform for various processes involving droplets, spanning from microfluidic devices to controllable chemical reactions. The previously unreported droplet manipulation phenomenon and control strategy shown here can potentially upgrade EWOD-based microfluidics, antifogging, anti-icing, dust removal, and beyond.},

Microfluidics-based biochemical sensing has been popularly used for various applications benefitting from the intrinsic advantages of low reagent consumption, rapid reaction rate, high throughput, easy integration, and facile automation. However, microfluidic device-based biochemical sensing is still limited by conventional signal readout that relies on sophisticated instruments and trained operators. Hence, the exploration of simplified signal readout is a critical issue in the development of microfluidic device-based biochemical sensing. In this review, equipment-free and low-cost signaling approaches for microfluidics are summarized, including colorimetric-readout, distance-readout, and smartphone-readout. Several other simplified signal readouts with potential to be integrated into microfluidics are described as well. Additionally, the prospects and challenges of simplified signal readout-based microfluidic devices are discussed.},

We present the design of a multi-well plate microfluidic biochip for protein crystallization; this biochip can transfer protein samples, prepare candidate solutions, and carry out crystallization automatically. To reduce the manufacturing cost of such devices, we present an efficient algorithm to generate a pin-assignment plan for the proposed design. The resulting biochip enables control of a large number of on-chip electrodes using only a small number of pins. Based on the pin-constrained chip design, we present an efficient shuttle-passenger-like droplet manipulation method to achieve high-throughput and defect-tolerant well loading.},

  abstract = {Dependability is an important attribute for microfluidic biochips that are used for safety-critical applications such as point-of-care health assessment, air-quality monitoring, and food-safety testing. Therefore, these devices must be adequately tested after manufacture and during bioassay operations. Known techniques for biochip testing are all function-oblivious, i.e., while they can detect and locate defect sites on a microfluidic array, they cannot be used to ensure correct operation of functional units. In this paper, we introduce the concept of functional testing of microfluidic biochips. We address fundamental biochip operations such as droplet dispensing, droplet transportation, mixing, splitting, and capacitive sensing. Long electrode actuation times are avoided to ensure that there is no electrode degradation during testing. We evaluate the proposed test methods using simulations as well as experiments for a fabricated biochip.},

  abstract = {Microfluidic technology provides a portable, cost-effective, and versatile tool for point-of-care (POC) bioanalysis because of its associated advantages such as fast analysis, low volumes of reagent consumption, and high portability. Along with microfluidics, the application of nanomaterials in biosensing has attracted lots of attention due to their unique physical and chemical properties for enhanced signal modulation such as signal amplification and signal transduction for POC bioanalysis. Hence, an enormous number of microfluidic devices integrated with nano-sensors have been developed for POC bioanalysis targeting low-resource settings. Herein, we review recent advances in POC bioanalysis on nano-sensorbased microfluidic platforms. We first briefly summarized the different types of cost-effective microfluidic platforms, followed by a concise introduction to nanomaterial-based biosensors. Then, we highlighted the application of microfluidic platforms integrated with nano-sensors for POC bioanalysis. Finally, we discussed the current limitations and perspective trends of the nano-sensor-based microfluidic platforms for POC bioanalysis.},

The current emphasis of testing is on detection of genetic material of SARS-CoV-2. Such tests are useful for assessing the current state of a subject: Infected or not infected. In addition to such tests, antibody testing is necessary to stratify the population into three groups: never exposed, infected, and immune. Such a stratification is necessary for safely reopening the society and remobilizing the economy. The aim of this review article is to inform the audience of the current diagnostic and surveillance technologies that are being employed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies along with their shortcomings, and to highlight microfluidic sensors and devices that show promise of being commercialized for detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in low-resource and Point-of-Care (POC) settings.},

  abstract = {Electrochemical methods have been shown to be advantageous to life sciences by supporting studies and discoveries in metabolism activities, DNA analysis, and neurotransmitter signaling. Meanwhile, the integration of Microelectrode Array (MEA) and the accessibility of CMOS technology permit high-density electrochemical sensing method. This paper describes an electrochemical imaging system equipped with a custom CMOS microchip. The microchip holds a 3.6 mm {\texttimes} 3.6 mm sensing area containing 16,064 Pt MEA, the associated 16,064 integrated read channels, and digital control circuits. The novel three-electrode system geometry with a 27.5 {\textmu}m spatial pitch enables cellular level chemical gradient imaging of bio-samples. The noise level of the on-chip read channel array allows amperometric detection of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine (NE) with concentrations from 4 {\textmu}M to 512 {\textmu}M with 4.7 pA/{\textmu}M sensitivity (R2 = 0.98). Electrochemical response to dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration was also characterized by deoxygenated deionized water containing 5\% to 80\% of the ambient oxygen concentrations with 86 pA/mg/L sensitivity (R2 = 0.89). The system also demonstrated selectivity to different target analytes using cyclic voltammetry method to simultaneously detect NE and uric acid. Also, a custom indium tin oxide with deposited Au glass electrode was integrated into the microfluidic system to enable pH measurement, ensuring the viability of bio-samples during experiments. Electrochemical images confirm the spatiotemporal performance at four frames per second while maintaining the sensitivity to target analytes. Finally, the overall system is controlled and continuously monitored by a MATLAB-based custom user interface, which is optimized for real-time high spatiotemporal resolution chemical imaging.},

  abstract = {The issue of food contamination by pathogens has become extreme serious due to the insensitive detection techniques. Escherichia coli O157:H7 is one of the harmful bacterial pathogens which is distributed in soil, marine and estuarine waters, the intestinal tract of animals, or water contaminated with fecal matter. Escherichia coli O157:H7, is an enterohaemorrhagic strain of the bacterium Escherichia coli (E.coli) and a cause of foodborne illness. It can cause serious human gastrointestinal disease. A small amount of E.coli with the dose fewer than 100 organisms in food products or water is enough to cause serious illness to human. Therefore, there is a need for a more sensitive, rapid method and yet a cost effective method to examine the food and environment safety. In this case, there are many CMOS fabricated acoustic waves based technologies which are initially designed for telecommunication applications and have been developed for pathogen detection recently due to their ultra-sensitivity to the surface changes. This paper reviews the detection of E.coli (one of the dangerous food pathogens), the design, characteristic and types of CMOS fabricated acoustic wave-based methods, typically surface acoustic waves (SAW) as for their label free, selective and ultra-sensitive detection and also their advantages over the current equipment such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and quartz crystal microbalances (QCM). Besides that, the elements and principle of SAW sensors are explored in E.coli DNA detection and the advantages of DNA probe over antibody probe. It also highlights the limitations of some types of acoustic waves based sensors for the E.coli detection.},

Each fluid system has developed special technologies for functional applications owing to the different interactions among solid, liquid and gas phases.           ,              Many engineering and industrial technologies as well as biological processes are closely related to surface wettability. The control of surface wettability attracts much attention due to the prospective applications based on liquid and droplet manipulation. However, the dynamic modification of wetting is still a challenging issue both in theoretical models and practical applications. Electrowetting (EW) is one of the most widely used methods for controlling the wettability of liquids due to its fast responding speed, large switching range and excellent durability. Since Gabriel Lippmann first discovered the electrocapillary (ECP) phenomenon in 1875, which is a precursor of electrowetting, there has been considerable progress in this field, especially accompanied with the development of wettability and interface science. In this paper, we review the developments of EW for droplet manipulation in view of wetting to superwetting systems over the past decades, including theoretical basis, electrodes and fluid systems, droplet manipulation and special phenomena induced by EW. Finally, we discuss several difficult challenges in this field and provide future research directions from our perspective.},

Modulating the wettability of the material surface is crucial in transporting droplets without external energy, adhesion loss, or intense controllability requirements. Although several studies have investigated droplet manipulation, its design principles have not been categorized considering the mechanical perspective. This review categorizes liquid droplet transport strategies based on wettability modulation into those involving (i) application of driving force to a droplet on nonsticking surfaces, (ii) formation of gradient surface chemistry/structure, and (iii) formation of anisotropic surface chemistry/structure. Accordingly, reported biological and artificial examples, cutting-edge applications, and future perspectives are summarized.},

In addition, components associated with fluidic control of the device, more specifically the valves and pumps, contribute significantly to the overall unit cost. Here we sketch the problem of a gap between high end accurate, but expensive sensor platforms,               versus               less accurate, but widely employable hand-held low-cost devices. Recent research has shown that the integration of light-responsive materials within microfluidic devices can provide the function of expensive fluidic components, and potentially enable sophisticated measurements to be made using much less expensive equipment. An overview of the most recent developments will be presented for valves, mixers, transport and sample handling inside microfluidic devices.},

  abstract = {Rapid prototyping methods enable the widespread adoption of microfluidic technologies by empowering end-users from non-engineering disciplines to make devices using processes that are rapid, simple and inexpensive. In this work, we developed a liquid molding technique to create silicone/PDMS microfluidic devices by replica molding. To construct a liquid mold, we use inexpensive adhesive-backed paper, an acetate backing sheet, and an off-the-shelf digital cutter to create paper molds, which we then wet with predetermined amounts of water. Due to the immiscibility of water and PDMS, mold patterns can be effectively transferred onto PDMS similarly to solid molds. We demonstrate the feasibility of these wet paper molds for the fabrication of PDMS microfluidic devices and assess the influence of various process parameters on device yield and quality. This method possesses some distinct benefits compared to conventional techniques such as photolithography and 3D printing. First, we demonstrate that the shape of a channel's crosssection may be altered from rectangular to semicircular by merely modifying the wetting parameters. Second, we illustrate how electrical impedance can be utilized as a marker for inspecting mold quality and identifying defects in a non-invasive manner without using visual tools such as microscopes or cameras. As a proof-of-concept device, we created a microfluidic T-junction droplet generator to produce water droplets in mineral oil ranging in size from 1.2 {\textmu}L to 75 {\textmu}L. We feel that this technology is an excellent addition to the microfluidic rapid prototyping toolbox and will find several applications in biological research.},

  abstract = {The migration of a small droplet has been developed during the last two decades due to its applications in industry and high technology such as MEMS and NEMS devices, Lap-On-a- chip, transportation of fluids and so on. There have many studies in this topic in which the energy source as driving force for moving of a droplet is quite difference like heating, magnetics, pressure, electric, laser and so on. In this study, the numerical computation is used to investigate the transient thermocapillary migration of a water droplet in a micro-channel under the effect of heating source. For tracking the evolution of the free interface between two immiscible fluids, we employed the finite element method with the two-phase level set technique to solve the Navier-Stokes equations and continuity equation coupled with the energy equation. Both the upper wall and the bottom wall of the microchannel are set to be an ambient temperature. 40mW heat source is placed at the distance of 1 mm from the initial position of a water droplet. When the heat source is turned on, a pair of asymmetric thermocapillary convection vortices is formed inside the droplet and the thermocapillary on the receding side is smaller than that on the advancing side. The temperature gradient inside the droplet increases quickly at the initial times and then decreases versus time. Therefore, the actuation velocity of the water droplet first increases significantly, and then decreases continuously. Furthermore, the results also indicate that the dynamic contact angle is strongly affected by the oil flow motion and the net thermocapillary momentum inside the droplet. The advancing contact angle is always larger than the receding contact angle during actuation process.},

  abstract = {Many scientific papers have been written concerning gas sensors for different sensor applications using several sensing principles. This review focuses on sensors and sensor systems for gaseous ammonia. Apart from its natural origin, there are many sources of ammonia, like the chemical industry or intensive life-stock. The survey that we present here treats different application areas for ammonia sensors or measurement systems and different techniques available for making selective ammonia sensing devices. When very low concentrations are to be measured, e.g. less than 2 ppb for environmental monitoring and 50 ppb for diagnostic breath analysis, solid-state ammonia sensors are not sensitive enough. In addition, they lack the required selectivity to other gasses that are often available in much higher concentrations. Optical methods that make use of lasers are often expensive and large. Indirect measurement principles have been described in literature that seems very suited as ammonia sensing devices. Such systems are suited for miniaturization and integration to make them suitable for measuring in the small gas volumes that are normally available in medical applications like diagnostic breath analysis equipment.},

Since some reactants like costly reagents and infant's blood are valuable, their usage should be minimized during dilution. In this paper, we propose an optimal reactant minimization algorithm, GORMA, for sample preparation on digital microfluidic biochips. GORMA adopts a systematic method to exhaustively check all possible dilution solutions and then identifies the one with minimal reactant usage and waste through maximal droplet sharing. Experimental results show that GORMA outperforms all the existing methods in reactant usage. Meanwhile, the waste amount is reduced up to 30\% as compared with existing waste minimization methods. Moreover, GORMA requires only 0.6\% more operations on average when compared with an operation-minimal dilution method.},

The importance of tactile sensor technology was recognized in the 1980s, along with a realization of the importance of computers and robotics. Despite this awareness, tactile sensors failed to be strongly adopted in industrial or consumer markets. In this paper, previous expectations of tactile sensors have been reviewed and the reasons for their failure to meet these expectations are discussed. The evolution of different tactile transduction principles, state of art designs and fabrication methods, and their pros and cons, are analyzed. From current development trends, new application areas for tactile sensors have been proposed. Literature from the last few decades has been revisited, and areas which are not appropriate for the use of tactile sensors have been identified. Similarly, the challenges that this technology needs to overcome in order to find its place in the market have been highlighted.},

It eliminates the need for post-CMOS processing and can scale up in numbers with the CMOS scaling. The presented design employs silane-mediated transfer of patterned gold electrode lines onto PDMS microfluidics such that the gold conformally coats the inside of microfluidic channel. Access to this electrode network is made possible by using ``through-PDMS-vias'' (TPV), which consist of high metal-coated SU-8 pillars manufactured by a novel process that employs a patterned positive resist layer as SU-8 adhesion depressor. When integrated with pneumatic valves, TPV and pseudo-RE network were able to bias 1.5 nanoliters (nL) of isolated electrolyte volumes. We present a detailed characterization of our pseudo-RE design demonstrating ISFET operation and its DC characterization. The stability of pseudo-RE is investigated by measuring open circuit potential (OCP) against a commercial Ag/AgCl reference electrode.},

In the present work, two setups based on Raspberry Pi and its CMOS-based camera (a 3D-printed device and an adaptation of a commercial product named We-Lab) were investigated as diagnostic instruments. Different camera elaboration processes were investigated, showing how direct access to the 10-bit raw data acquired from the sensor before downstream imaging processes could be beneficial for photometric applications. The developed solution was successfully applied to the evaluation of the oxidative stress using two commercial kits (d-ROM Fast; PAT).

Owing to its simplicity and effectiveness, electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) is one of the most commonly studied and applied effects to implement DMF. However, complex biomedical assays usually require more sophisticated sample handling and detection capabilities than basic EWOD manipulation. Alternatively, combined systems integrating EWOD actuators and other fluidic handling techniques are essential for bringing DMF into practical use. In this paper, we briefly review the main approaches for the integration/combination of EWOD with other microfluidic manipulation methods or additional external fields for specified biomedical applications. The form of integration ranges from independently operating sub-systems to fully coupled hybrid actuators. The corresponding biomedical applications of these works are also summarized to illustrate the significance of these innovative combination attempts.},

The scope of the review covers both approaches, though the focus is on the printed mold approach, which is a kind of the so-called replica mold approach or soft lithography approach. This approach is, in essence, casting PDMS materials with the mold which is printed. The paper also includes our on-going effort on the printed mold approach. The main contribution of this paper is the identification of knowledge gaps and elaboration of future work toward closing the knowledge gaps in fabrication of PDMS microfluidic devices. The second contribution is the development of a novel classification of AM processes from design thinking. There is also a contribution in clarifying confusion in the literature regarding the soft lithography technique; this classification has provided a consistent ontology in the sub-field of the fabrication of microfluidic devices involving AM processes.},

In this study, we have demonstrated an electrowetting-ondielectric (EWOD) digital microfluidic device (DMF) as an efficient in-line work-up tool for organic chemical synthesis reactions. The model protocol performed on EWOD DMF involves an acid-base workup, liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), and in-line solvent-swap. Device operation parameters of each reactant and unit process have been optimized. This study manifests the capacity of an EWOD device to transform into a drug discovery platform, particularly by hosting synthetically important reactions that require complicated work-up sequences.},

  abstract = {On-chip functional blocks for sample preprocessing are necessary elements for the implementation of fully portable micrototal analysis systems ({$\mu$}TAS). We demonstrate and characterize the microparticle and whole-blood manipulation capabilities of surface acoustic wave (SAW) driven counterflow micropumps. The motion of suspended cells in this system is governed by the two dominant acoustic forces associated with the scattered SAW (of wavelength {$\lambda$}f): acoustic-radiation force and acoustic-streaming Stokesian drag force. We show that by reducing the microchannel height (h) beyond a threshold value the balance of these forces is shifted toward the acoustic-radiation force and that this yields control of two different regimes of microparticle dynamics. In the regime dominated by the acoustic radiation force (h {$\lessequivlnt$} {$\lambda$}f), microparticles are collected in the seminodes of the partial standing sound-wave arising from reflections off microchannel walls. This enables the complete separation of plasma and corpuscular components of whole blood in periodical predetermined positions without any prior sample dilution. Conversely, in the regime dominated by acoustic streaming (h {$\gg$} {$\lambda$}f), the microbeads follow vortical streamlines in a pattern characterized by three different phases during microchannel filling. This makes it possible to generate a cell-concentration gradient within whole-blood samples, a behavior not previously reported in any acoustic-streaming device. By careful device design, a new class of SAW pumping devices is presented that allows the manipulation and pretreatment of whole-blood samples for portable and integrable biological chips and is compatible with handheld battery-operated devices.},

  abstract = {Widespread demand for the analysis and control of water quality and supply for human activity and ecosystem sustainability has necessitated the continuous improvement of water analysis methods in terms of their reliability, efficiency, and costs. To satisfy these requirements, flow-injection analysis using different detection methods has successfully been developed in recent decades. This review, based on about 100 original research papers, presents the achievements in this field over the past ten years. Various methodologies for establishing flow-injection measurements are reviewed, together with microfluidics and portable systems. The developed applications mostly concern not only the determination of inorganic analytes but also the speciation analysis of different elements, and the determination of several total indices of water quality. Examples of the determination of organic residues (e.g., pesticides, phenolic compounds, and surfactants) in natural surface waters, seawater, groundwater, and drinking water have also been identified. Usually, changes in the format of manual procedures for flow-injection determination results in the improvement of various operational parameters, such as the limits of detection, the sampling rate, or selectivity in different matrices.},

The fluids are set in motion using the electrowetting effect resulting in a pressure difference inside the tube. A model of the pressure field for various viscosities of the surrounding fluid is obtained by finite element analysis of the Navier-Stokes equation. From the time-dependent pressure response and the associated viscous damping, a correlation with the fluid's dynamic viscosity is obtained. In the next step, we study the pressure evolution after driving the polar fluid in one direction and stopping it rapidly at the edge of the driving electrode. The decay time of the pressure induced height difference inside the PCCs can also be related to the surrounding non-polar fluid's viscosity. Subsequently, an alternative low-cost fabrication process of an EWOD stack is used to build the device simulated. The built device is tested by measuring silicon oils and a comparison between already established methods for viscosity sensing and our ``tube'' method is made.},

  abstract = {Microfluidics is a rapidly growing discipline that involves studying and manipulating fluids at reduced length scale and volume, typically on the scale of micro- or nanoliters. Under the reduced length scale and larger surface-to-volume ratio, advantages of low reagent consumption, faster reaction kinetics, and more compact systems are evident in microfluidics. However, miniaturization of microfluidic chips and systems introduces challenges of stricter tolerances in designing and controlling them for interdisciplinary applications. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have brought innovation to microfluidics from design, simulation, automation, and optimization to bioanalysis and data analytics. In microfluidics, the Navier--Stokes equations, which are partial differential equations describing viscous fluid motion that in complete form are known to not have a general analytical solution, can be simplified and have fair performance through numerical approximation due to low inertia and laminar flow. Approximation using neural networks trained by rules of physical knowledge introduces a new possibility to predict the physicochemical nature. The combination of microfluidics and automation can produce large amounts of data, where features and patterns that are difficult to discern by a human can be extracted by machine learning. Therefore, integration with AI introduces the potential to revolutionize the microfluidic workflow by enabling the precision control and automation of data analysis. Deployment of smart microfluidics may be tremendously beneficial in various applications in the future, including high-throughput drug discovery, rapid point-of-care-testing (POCT), and personalized medicine. In this review, we summarize key microfluidic advances integrated with AI and discuss the outlook and possibilities of combining AI and microfluidics.},

Washing of magnetic beads was achieved by movement through a narrow region of buffer bridging one drop to another with minimal fluid transfer. More than 90 \% of the unbound reagents were removed after five washes. Further experiments testing human blood serum on the same platform demonstrated a sample-to-answer time at {$\sim$}18.5 min detecting 6.79 ng/ mL cTnI.},

Beads with 1.5 lm diameter flowing in a 100 lm deep channel were trapped at 7.5 MHz using a 23.7 peak-to-peak voltage (Vpp) sinusoidal input. The trap located at 50 {\textpm} 0.1 lm depth was measured to have a stiffness of approximately 0.6 pN/lm. With this simple device we can trap and control the axial position of micrometer scale objects, which allows for the manipulation of beads and cells. We intend to use the device for force spectroscopy on micro-bead tethered DNA. This can be combined with super-resolution imaging techniques to study mechanics and binding of protein structures along a DNA strand as a function of induced tension.},

Further characterizations of these devices include electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and an aqueous electrochemical assessment of the electrode surface area and diffusion through the porous layer.

Digital microfluidics system has extended the scope of microfluidics by providing automated, precise flow control for point-of-care devices capable of medical diagnostics, environmental, and chemical sensing platforms. In this paper, we introduce a digital microfluidics platform based on electrowetting on a dielectric using PCB substrate designed on Easy EDA software. The platform's performance was analyzed at various DC voltages between 200 V and 400 V for droplet actuation. PCB fabrication, the utilization of easily accessible and cheap materials such as cooking oil and grafting tape as a dielectric layer, allowed the fabrication to be affordable and simple. The results indicate that droplet actuation takes place at 220 V. The droplet velocity obtained was 2.6 mm/s and 1.51 mm/s using silicon oil and cooking oil, respectively, at 400 V. Our proposed digital microfluidics platform will play a vital role in droplet actuation and can be used for diagnostic applications such as DNA analysis and cell culture due to its simple fabrication and cost-effective technique.},

Cell handling and separation for research and clinical applications aims to efficiently separate specific cell populations. Here, we investigated the sorting of CD8 lymphocytes from peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) products by affinity-bead-mediated acoustophoresis. PBPC samples were obtained from healthy donors (n = 4) and patients (n = 18). Mononuclear cells were labeled with anti-CD8-coated magnetic beads and sorted on an acoustophoretic microfluidic device and by standard magnetic cell sorting as a reference method. CD8 lymphocytes were acoustically sorted with a mean purity of 91\% {\textasciibreve} 8\% and a median separation efficiency of 63\% (range 15.1\%--90.5\%) as compared to magnetic sorting (purity 91\% {\textasciibreve} 14\%, recovery 29\% (range 5.1\%--47.3\%)). The viability as well as the proliferation capacity of sorted lymphocytes in the target fraction were unimpaired and, furthermore, hematopoietic progenitor cell assay revealed a preserved clonogenic capacity post-sorting. Bead-mediated acoustophoresis can, therefore, be utilized to efficiently sort less frequent CD8+ lymphocytes from PBPC products in a continuous flow mode while maintaining cell viability and functional capacity of both target and non-target fractions.},

This paper presents the use of acoustophoresis, an ultrasound based microfluidic separation technology, for label-free, gentle and continuous separation of mononuclear cells (MNCs) from diluted whole blood. Red blood cells (RBCs) and MNCs behave similar in an acoustic standing wave field, compromising acoustic separation of MNC from RBC in standard buffer systems. However, by optimizing the buffer conditions and thereby changing the acoustophoretic mobility of the cells, we were able to enrich MNCs relative to RBCs by a factor of 2,800 with MNC recoveries up to 88\%. The acoustophoretic microchip can perform cell separation at a processing rate of more than 1\,{\texttimes}\,10               5               cells/s, corresponding to 5\,{\textmu}l/min undiluted whole blood equivalent.

Recently, open-source platforms have gained considerable popularity among tech-savvy chemists because their implementation often does not require expert knowledge and investment of funds. Thus, chemistry students and researchers can easily start implementing them after a few hours of reading tutorials and trial-and-error. Single-board microcontrollers and micro-computers such as Arduino, Teensy, Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone enable collecting experimental data with high precision as well as efficient control of electric potentials and actuation of mechanical systems. They are readily programmed using high-level languages, such as C, C++, JavaScript or Python. They can also be coupled with mobile consumer electronics, including smartphones as well as teleinformatic networks. More demanding analytical tasks require fast signal processing. Field-programmable gate arrays enable efficient and inexpensive prototyping of high-performance analytical platforms, thus becoming increasingly popular among analytical chemists.

  abstract = {Abstract                            A novel method of modeling multiple frequency dielectrophoresis (MFDEP) is introduced based on the concept of an effective Clausius--Mossotti factor, CM               eff               , for a particle that is exposed to electrical fields of different frequencies, coming either from one or multiple pairs of electrodes. This analysis clearly illustrates how adding frequencies adds control parameters, up to two additional parameters               per               frequency. As a result, MFDEP can be used for a wide variety of applications, including separating particles with very similar Clausius--Mossotti spectra, trapping multiple groups of cells simultaneously, and cancelling unwanted dielectrophoretic traps. Illustrating the modeling approach, we determine the CM               eff               s for live and dead yeast cells, and then predict their equilibrium distribution on a three-electrode configuration, with two electrodes at different frequencies and the third electrode at ground. This prediction is validated experimentally, using MFDEP to selectively attract live cells to one location and dead cells to another, trapping both. These results demonstrate that the use of multiple frequencies for the manipulation of particles can enhance the performance of dielectrophoretic devices, not only for sorting, but also for such applications as patterning cells in close proximity for the formation of cell consortia.},

We therefore seek to develop a robust, scalable fabrication method for the realization of EWOD on a flexible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate in order to increase the range of possible applications. We fabricated a 5 {\texttimes} 5 array of individually controlled electrowetting cells to manipulate silicone oil droplets via EWOD. The fabrication process utilized exclusively flexible materials to improve the robustness of the overall device, and processing methods were adapted to accommodate the particular challenges posed by flexible materials. Simulation of the EWOD devices was conducted using ANSYS Fluent and showed the change in contact angle in response to voltage applied. Fabricated devices were also tested, with actuation of the oil droplet observed with up to 100 V (RMS) AC applied across underlying electrodes. We demonstrated fabrication of a fully flexible array and verified actuation to center droplets over the electrodes. This work may be expanded to address more specific flexible applications for EWOD.},

A more in-depth exploration of using PCBs as a mold substrate and a novel methodology of using flexible PCBs to produce highly accurate MF chips is reported here for the first time. Cross sections highlight the improved accuracy of this method, and peel testing is performed to demonstrate suitable adhesion between the glass substrate and PDMS cast. Positive cell growth viability showcases this novel method as a high-accuracy, high-accessibility, low-cost prototyping method for microfluidic chips while still maintaining all favorable properties provided by the PDMS material.},

Because our strategy is compatible with most usual hydrocarbon solvents, such droplets can be used as microcompartments for reagents.

To address this problem we have collected an extensive dataset for six different volatile organic compounds over a period of three years under tightly controlled operating conditions using an array of 16 metal-oxide gas sensors. The recordings were made using the same sensor array and a robust gas delivery system. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the most comprehensive datasets available for the design and development of drift compensation methods, which is freely reachable on-line. We introduced a machine learning approach, namely an ensemble of classifiers, to solve a gas discrimination problem over extended periods of time with high accuracy rates. Experiments clearly indicate the presence of drift in the sensors during the period of three years and that it degrades the performance of the classifiers. Our proposed ensemble method based on support vector machines uses a weighted combination of classifiers trained at different points of time. As our experimental results illustrate, the ensemble of classifiers is able to cope well with sensor drift and performs better than the baseline competing methods.},

In this approach, the particles were extracted from the droplet by the interplay of capillary, magnetic and electrowetting forces, thereby avoiding the use of mechanical components that would be needed for removing the magnet when particle resuspension is required. This droplet manipulation allowed the execution of very efficient and fast washing protocols on the digital microfluidic (DMF) platform. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this particle extraction protocol, an IgG immunoassay was implemented on the DMF platform. Our improved protocol reduced the overall assay variability to 3\% coefficient of variation (CV) while all incubation and washing steps were automatically performed onchip. In addition, the suspended magnetic particles allowed the introduction of a very efficient mixing strategy by using the magnetic particles as magnetic stirrers, resulting in an improvement of 90\% in detection limit compared to a passive mixing strategy, solely based on diffusion.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) lab-on-a-chip systems have already proven their potential within a broad range of bio-assays. Nevertheless, research on the analytical performance of those systems is limited, yet crucial for a further breakthrough in the diagnostic field. Therefore, this paper presents the intrinsic possibilities of an EWOD lab-on-a-chip as a versatile platform for homogeneous and heterogeneous bio-assays with high analytical performance. Both droplet dispensing and splitting cause variations in droplet size, thereby directly influencing the assay's performance. The extent to which they influence the performance is assessed by a theoretical sensitivity analysis, which allows the definition of a basic framework for the reduction of droplet size variability. Taking advantage of the optimized droplet manipulations, both homogeneous and heterogeneous bio-assays are implemented in the EWOD lab-on-a-chip to demonstrate the analytical capabilities and versatility of the device. A fully on-chip enzymatic assay is realized with high analytical performance. It demonstrates the promising capabilities of an EWOD lab-on-a-chip in food-related and medical applications, such as nutritional and blood analyses. Further, a magnetic bio-assay for IgE detection using superparamagnetic nanoparticles is presented whereby the nanoparticles are used as solid carriers during the bio-assay. Crucial elements are the precise manipulation of the superparamagnetic nanoparticles with respect to dispensing and separation. Although the principle of using nano-carriers is demonstrated for protein detection, it can be easily extended to a broader range of bio-related applications like DNA sensing. In heterogeneous bio-assays the chip surface is actively involved during the execution of the bio-assay. Through immobilization of specific biological compounds like DNA, proteins and cells a reactive chip surface is realized, which enhances the bio-assay performance. To demonstrate this potential, on-chip adhesion islands are fabricated to immobilize MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Viability studies are performed to assess the functionalization efficiency.},

Superhydrophobic materials hold considerable promise for potential applications ranging from self cleaning surfaces, completely water impermeable textiles to low cost energy displacement of liquids in lab-on-chip devices. However, the dynamic modification of the liquid droplets behavior and in particular of their wetting properties on these surfaces is still a challenging issue. In this review, after a brief overview on superhydrophobic states definition, the techniques leading to the modification of wettability behavior on superhydrophobic surfaces under specific conditions: optical, magnetic, mechanical, chemical, thermal are discussed. Finally, a focus on electrowetting is made from historical phenomenon pointed out some decades ago on classical planar hydrophobic surfaces to recent breakthrough obtained on superhydrophobic surfaces.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The direction of modern analytical techniques is to push for lower detection limits, improved selectivity and sensitivity, faster analysis time, higher throughput, and more inexpensive analysis systems with ever-decreasing sample volumes. These very ambitious goals are exacerbated by the need to reduce the overall size of the device and the instrumentation -- the quest for functional micrototal analysis systems epitomizes this. Microfluidic devices fabricated in glass, and more recently, in a variety of polymers, brings us a step closer to being able to achieve these stringent goals and to realize the economical fabrication of sophisticated instrumentation. However, this places a significant burden on the detection systems associated with microchip-based analysis systems. There is a need for a universal detector that can efficiently detect sample analytes in real time and with minimal sample manipulation steps, such as lengthy labeling protocols. This review highlights the advances in uncommon or less frequently used detection methods associated with microfluidic devices. As a result, the three most common methods -- LIF, electrochemical, and mass spectrometric techniques -- are omitted in order to focus on the more esoteric detection methods reported in the literature over the last 2\,years.},

This technology is consistent, manufacturable, requires low power, low cost, and, perhaps most importantly, scalable. In this feature article, we discuss the recent progresses of CMOS image sensors in the detection foodborne bacterial pathogens. In addition, this article presents and discusses trends in designing of CMOS sensors along with the challenges and future prospective of these sensors to detect foodborne bacterial pathogens.

  abstract = {A new feedback and biological analysis system for digital microfluidics that uses an imaging based setup.           ,              Digital microfluidics (DMF) is a technology that provides a means of manipulating nL--{$\mu$}L volumes of liquids on an array of electrodes. By applying an electric potential to an electrode, these discrete droplets can be controlled in parallel which can be transported, mixed, reacted, and analyzed. Typically, an automation system is interfaced with a DMF device that uses a standard set of basic instructions written by the user to execute droplet operations. Here, we present the first feedback method for DMF that relies on imaging techniques that will allow online detection of droplets without the need to reactivate all destination electrodes. Our system consists of integrating open-source electronics with a CMOS camera and a zoom lens for acquisition of the images that will be used to detect droplets on the device. We also created an algorithm that uses a Hough transform to detect a variety of droplet sizes and to detect singular droplet dispensing and movement failures on the device. As a first test, we applied this feedback system to test droplet movement for a variety of liquids used in cell-based assays and to optimize different feedback actuation schemes to improve droplet movement fidelity. We also applied our system to a colorimetric enzymatic assay to show that our system is capable of biological analysis. Overall, we believe that using our approach of integrating imaging and feedback for DMF can provide a platform for automating biological assays with analysis.},

Typhi or Paratyphi A, B or C, is common in resource-limited regions of the world, where poor sanitation infrastructure facilitates faeco-oral transmission. Prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics minimises illness severity, but presentation to health care facilities is often delayed because of the non-specific nature of the symptoms and the lack of reliable diagnostic tests. Disease prevention requires significant investment in provision of clean water and sanitation in the long term; vaccination offers a more realistic strategy for medium term control. However, implementation of existing vaccines and development of more efficacious vaccines has been hindered by the lack of an established correlate of protection and under appreciation of the true disease burden. Human microbial infection studies could provide a vehicle for the rapid evaluation of novel vaccines and investigation of the immunobiology of enteric infection.},

  abstract = {This work describes the modern development of an autonomous platform for the measurement of phosphate and nitrogen levels in the water. Microfluidic-based framework developed for the identification of contaminants in water as, it has enormous potential in making chip portable, low cost, and miniaturized commercial device. The total framework uses an embedded system and a microfluidic chip. This microfluidic chip is made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and has been fabricated by X-ray (XRL) lithography techniques. The created framework contains liquid handling with luminescence information investigation, which is important to play out the phosphate and nitrogen estimation. Tests are performed for the detection of phosphate, nitrite, and nitrate utilizing explicit synthetic reagents and tests for each. The created colorimetric-implanted framework can utilized for any liquid investigation like zinc, copper, and lead contaminant detection that usually found in contaminated water. This sort of framework is alluring for use in creating nations, in the field, and rustic regions.},

The ability to fabricate a complete microfluidic device in a single step from a computer model has obvious attractions, but it is the ability to create truly three dimensional structures that will provide new microfluidic capability that is challenging, if not impossible to make with existing approaches. This critical review covers the current state of 3D printing for microfluidics, focusing on the four most frequently used printing approaches: inkjet (i3DP), stereolithography (SLA), two photon polymerisation (2PP) and extrusion printing (focusing on fused deposition modeling). It discusses current achievements and limitations, and opportunities for advancement to reach 3D printing's full potential.},

The objective of the study was to examine the chemical, physical and biological characteristics of the river and to determine the level and classification at each site based on the Water Quality Index (WQI) and National Water Quality Standards (NWQS). Water samples from the river were subjected to in-situ and laboratory water quality analyses and focused on six (6) important parameters based on WQI which are Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD5), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Suspended Solid (TSS), Ammoniacal Nitrogen (NH3-N), and pH. All testing procedures used in this study adhered to the American Public Health Association (APHA) testing procedures. Based on the results obtained, the quality of water for four (4) sampling stations along Sg. Perak can be concluded as CLASS III with only one station concluded as CLASS IV according to the National Water Quality Standards (NWQS). For Sg. Kinta, four sampling stations were classified as CLASS III whereas only one station falls into CLASS II. It is important to determine the WQI at different areas of along the river in order to predict (possible) points of pollution for monitoring purposes.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce computer-aided microfluidics (CAMF), a process that allows the creation of complex microfluidic structures from their concept to the actual chip within a day. During design and testing of new microfluidic systems, rapid and frequent design modifications have to be carried out. For this purpose, a device using maskless projection lithography based on a digital mirror device (DMD) has been developed. Digital mask layouts may be created using any graphics program (Microsoft Paint, Adobe Photoshop) and can be used as such by the custom-written control software of the system. However, we suggest using another approach: direct importing of three-dimensional digital computer-aided design (CAD) models from which mask information can be directly parsed. This process is advantageous as commercial 3D-CAD systems allow the rapid generation of static or parameterized models which can be used for computerized analyses like, e.g., flow simulation. After model validation, the mask information is extracted from these models and directly used by the lithography device. A chip or replication master is then created by means of lithography using curable monomers or resists as, e.g., Accura 60 or SU-8. With CAMF, the whole process from digital 3D model creation to actually running the experiment can be done within a day.},

However, the lack of chemical signal processing blocks and the wide use of electronic devices to process electrical signals in existing molecular communication platforms can hardly meet the biocompatible, non-invasive, and size-miniaturised requirements of applications in various fields, e.g., medicine, biology, and environment sciences. To tackle this, here we design and construct a liquid-based microfluidic molecular communication platform for performing chemical concentration signal processing and digital signal transmission over distances. By specifically designing chemical reactions and microfluidic geometry, the transmitter of our platform is capable of shaping the emitted signals, and the receiver is able to threshold, amplify, and detect the chemical signals after propagation. By encoding bit information into the concentration of sodium hydroxide, we demonstrate that our platform can achieve molecular signal modulation and demodulation functionalities, and reliably transmit text messages over long distances. This platform is further optimised to maximise data rate while minimising communication error. The presented methodology for real-time chemical signal processing can enable the implementation of signal processing units in biological settings and then unleash its potential for interdisciplinary applications.},

The minimum achievable droplet volume is around 0.5 nL, which is two orders of magnitude smaller than the smallest droplet ever reported on active-matrix digital microfluidics. The movement of droplets can be either pre-programmed or controlled in real-time. The FPDA system shows great potential of the ubiquitous thin-film electronics technology in digital liquid handling.

  abstract = {The dream of human beings for long living has stimulated the rapid development of biomedical and healthcare equipment. However, conventional biomedical and healthcare devices have shortcomings such as short service life, large equipment size, and high potential safety hazards. Indeed, the power supply for conventional implantable device remains predominantly batteries. The emerging nanogenerators, which harvest micro/nanomechanical energy and thermal energy from human beings and convert into electrical energy, provide an ideal solution for self-powering of biomedical devices. The combination of nanogenerators and biomedicine has been accelerating the development of self-powered biomedical equipment. This article first introduces the operating principle of nanogenerators and then reviews the progress of nanogenerators in biomedical applications, including power supply, smart sensing, and effective treatment. Besides, the microbial disinfection and biodegradation performances of nanogenerators have been updated. Next, the protection devices have been discussed such as face mask with air filtering function together with real-time monitoring of human health from the respiration and heat emission. Besides, the nanogenerator devices have been categorized by the types of mechanical energy from human beings, such as the body movement, tissue and organ activities, energy from chemical reactions, and gravitational potential energy. Eventually, the challenges and future opportunities in the applications of nanogenerators are delivered in the conclusive remarks.                                                                image},

While this challenge has traditionally been addressed by pin-count minimization strategies and circuit-routing schemes, we propose heart-shape electrodes that allow using even ewer pins when the droplet motion is unidirectional.

Droplets with a ootprint diameter between 0.8 and 1 times the electrode width can be driven reliably over long distances using only two alternately applied actuation signals. The maximum signal switching requency that enables the reliable movement o droplets is proportional to the square o the applied voltage and the gap height, but inversely proportional to the electrode diameter. Each segment o the interconnection circuit spans only two electrode-lengths, which simplifes the circuit routing and avoids the possible trace overlap in large-scale electrode arrays. By minimizing the pin number, this asymmetric design provides a promising strategy or electrode arrangement in multiunctional, large-scale EWOD platorms.},

  abstract = {Determining the distributions and variations of chemical elements in oceans has significant meanings for understanding the biogeochemical cycles, evaluating seawater pollution, and forecasting the occurrence of marine disasters. The primary chemical parameters of ocean monitoring include nutrients, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and heavy metals. At present, ocean monitoring mainly relies on laboratory analysis, which is hindered in applications due to its large size, high power consumption, and low representative and time-sensitive detection results. By integrating photonics and microfluidics into one chip, optofluidics brings new opportunities to develop portable microsystems for ocean monitoring. Optofluidic platforms have advantages in respect of size, cost, timeliness, and parallel processing of samples compared with traditional instruments. This review describes the applications of optofluidic platforms on autonomous and in situ ocean environmental monitoring, with an emphasis on their principles, sensing properties, advantages, and disadvantages. Predictably, autonomous and in situ systems based on optofluidic platforms will have important applications in ocean environmental monitoring.},

  abstract = {As a kind of zero-tolerance foodborne pathogens, Salmonella typhimurium poses a great threat to quality of food products and public health. Hence, rapid and efficient approaches to identify Salmonella typhimurium are urgently needed. Combined with PCR and fluorescence technique, real-time PCR (qPCR) and digital PCR (ddPCR) are regarded as suitable tools for detecting foodborne pathogens. To compare the effect between qPCR and ddPCR in detecting Salmonella typhimurium, a series of nucleic acid, pure strain culture and spiking milk samples were applied and the resistance to inhibitors referred in this article as well. Compared with qPCR, ddPCR exhibited more sensitive (10- 4 ng/{$\mu$}l or 102 cfu/ml) and less pre-culturing time (saving 2 h). Moreover, ddPCR had stronger resistance to inhibitors than qPCR, yet absolute quantification hardly performed when target's concentration over 1 ng/{$\mu$}l or 106 cfu/ml. This study provides an alternative strategy in detecting foodborne Salmonella typhimurium.},

Compared with traditional digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs), P-DMFBs enjoy notable advantages, such as faster in-place fabrication with printer and ink, lower costs, better disposability, etc. Because electrodes and CNT control lines are printed on the same side of a paper, a new design challenge for P-DMFB is to prevent the interference between moving droplets and the voltages on CNT control lines. These interactions may result in unexpected droplet movements and thus incorrect assay outputs.},

  abstract = {As digital microfluidics-based biochips find more applications, their complexity is expected to increase significantly owing to the trend of multiple and concurrent assays on the chip. There is a pressing need to deliver a top-down design methodology that the biochip designer can leverage the same level of computer-aided design support as the semi-conductor industry now does. Moreover, as microelectronics fabrication technology is scaling up and integrated device performance is improving, it is expected that these microfluidic biochips will be integrated with microelectronic components in nextgeneration system-on-chip designs. This study presents the analysis and experiments of digital microfluidic operations on a novel electrowetting-on-dielectric-based `micro-electrode dot array architecture' that fosters a development path for hierarchical top-down design approach for digital microfluidics. The proposed architecture allows dynamic configurations and activations of identical basic microfluidic unit called `micro-electrode cells' to design microfluidic components, layouts, routing, microfluidic operations and applications of the biochip hierarchically. Fundamental microfluidic operations have been successfully performed by the architecture. In addition, this novel architecture demonstrates a number of advantages and flexibilities over the conventional digital microfluidics in performing advanced microfluidic operations.},

In DMF, discrete droplets containing samples and reagents are controlled to implement a series of operations via electrowetting-on-dielectric. This process works by applying electrical potentials to an array of electrodes coated with a hydrophobic dielectric layer. Unlike microchannels, DMF facilitates precise control over multiple reaction processes without using complex pump, microvalve, and tubing networks. DMF also presents other distinct features, such as portability, less sample consumption, shorter chemical reaction time, flexibility, and easier combination with other technology types. Due to its unique advantages, DMF has been applied to a broad range of fields (e.g., chemistry, biology, medicine, and environment). This study reviews the basic principles of droplet actuation, configuration design, and fabrication of the DMF device, as well as discusses the latest progress in DMF from the biochemistry perspective.},

  abstract = {Unionised ammonia (NH3) is highly toxic to freshwater organisms. Yet, most of the available toxicity data on NH3 were predominantly generated from temperate regions, while toxicity data on NH3 derived from tropical species were limited. To address this issue, we first conducted standard acute toxicity tests on NH3 using ten tropical freshwater species. Subsequently, we constructed a tropical species sensitivity distribution (SSD) using these newly generated toxicity data and available tropical toxicity data of NH3, which was then compared with the corresponding temperate SSD constructed from documented temperate acute toxicity data. Our results showed that tropical species were generally more sensitive to NH3 than their temperate counterparts. Based on the ratio between temperate and tropical hazardous concentration 10\% values, we recommend an extrapolation factor of four to be applied when surrogate temperate toxicity data or temperate water quality guidelines of NH3 are used for protecting tropical freshwater ecosystems.},

To evaluate the method, testing devices are fabricated by the micro fabrication technology. First, this method is examined for magnetic particle concentration, showing that over 91\% of magnetic particles can be concentrated into a split daughter droplet. Then, separation between magnetic and non-magnetic particles is examined for two different cases of particle mixture, showing in both cases that over 91\% of the magnetic particles can be concentrated into split daughter droplets. However, a significant number of the non-magnetic particles (over 35\%) co-exist with the magnetic particles in the same daughter droplets. This problem is circumvented by adding a droplet-merging step prior to applying the magnetic field. Finally, over 94\% of the total magnetic particles are separated into a one split daughter droplet while 92\% of the non-magnetic particles into the other split daughter droplet. This integrated in-droplet separation method may bridge many existing magnetic particle assays to digital microfluidics and extend their application scope.},

The PET substrate and food wrap film are low cost and accessible to general users. The proposed flexible DMF chips can be reused for a long time by replacing the dielectric film coated with hydrophobic layer. The resolution and conductivity of silver traces and the contact angle and velocity of the droplets were evaluated to demonstrate that the proposed technology is comparable to the traditional DMF fabrication process. As far as the rapid prototyping of DMF is concerned, this technology has shown very attractive advantages in many aspects, such as fabrication cost, fabrication time, material selection and mass production capacity, without sacrificing the performance of DMF.

However, the use of jargon and the different perspectives of scientists and electronic engineers often result in different viewpoints on principles of electrochemical models, which can impede the effective development of sensor technology. This paper is aimed to fill the knowledge gap between electronic engineers and scientists by providing a review and an analysis of electrochemical models. First, a brief review of the electrochemical sensor mechanism from a scientist's perspective is presented. Then a general model, which reflects a more realistic situation of nanosensors is proposed from an electronic engineer point of view and a comparison between the Randles Model is given with its application in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and general sensor design. Finally, with the help of the proposed equivalent model, a cohesive explanation of the scan rate of cyclic voltammetry is discussed. The information of this paper can contribute to enriching the knowledge of electrochemical sensor models for scientists and is also able to guide the electronic engineer on designing next-generation sensor layouts.},

Resistive-switching memristor is an emerging artificial intelligence device.

In the paper, Fe doped ZnO memristors have been successfully prepared by a simple hydrothermal method, and exhibit reversible electronic resistive switching behavior, which is mainly attributed to the electron trapping and detrapping from the introduced oxygen vacancies by Fe doping. The surface structure of hierarchical dual-layer nanorod array endows the prepared ZnO memristors with reversible EWOD response of low energy consumption, which enables the device to satisfy the development of excellent EWOD device. Through the in-depth study, the stable high and low resistive states of prepared Fe doped ZnO memristors have distinct surface wetting properties, and the liquid droplet on the memristors can be intelligently controlled, and realize the resistive-switching EWOD intelligent device. The work gives a new way to the development of excellent artificial intelligence liquid switch and devices.},

In this study, a lab-on-chip device was developed for rapid, automatic and sensitive detection of viable               Salmonella typhimurium               using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and smartphone real-time turbidity monitoring. First, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) coated with anti-               Salmonella               capture antibodies in propidium monoazide (PMA) were fully mixed with bacterial samples using two active magnetic stirring mixers at reverse rotating directions, and incubated in the serpentine channel with 470 nm blue light exposure, allowing specific formation of magnetic bacteria and sufficient PMA pretreatment of the DNA of dead bacteria. Then, the PMA-treated magnetic bacteria were separated in the separation chamber using the magnetic field and their genomic DNA templates were extracted using lysis buffer at 70 {$^\circ$}C. Finally, the viable bacteria's DNA was amplified using LAMP in the detection chamber preloaded with the lyophilized LAMP reagents at 67.5 {$^\circ$}C after blocking with paraffin oil to avoid aerosol cross contamination. Finally, the turbidity of the LAMP reaction system was monitored in a real-time manner for the quantitative detection of viable bacteria. The experimental results demonstrated that this device was able to automatically detect viable               Salmonella               as low as 14 CFU mL               -1               in spiked chicken meat supernatants within 1.5 h. This device is very promising to provide a sample-in-result-out solution for the in-field detection of               Salmonella               and could be easily extended for other foodborne pathogens.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting (EW) is an effective method for droplet manipulation in microfluidics. In traditional EW, a conductive droplet is actuated, which spreads on a solid substrate. Recently, we considered an opposite phenomenon of droplet actuation in EW: inducing nonconductive droplet dewetting and detaching from the substrate. An oil/water system is used in which the oil droplet (nonconductive) is actuated on a flat substrate in surrounding water (conductive) by EW. In this work, alternating current (AC) electric fields are applied to EW, and the transient dynamics of droplet dewetting, oscillation, and detachment with the AC signals are investigated. The droplet is not in contact with electrodes, and it dances freely on the substrate. Experiments are performed in a wide range of voltages and AC frequencies. To demonstrate the droplet dynamics, we divide the full process of droplet manipulation into three distinguishable periods, that is, an initiating period, a steady oscillation period, and a detaching condition. Transient droplet dewetting is considered in the initiating period, and we obtain the distribution of the contact line friction factor. In steady oscillation, the oscillation resonance is verified from the oscillating amplitude of the contact line. Different periodical features are found for the droplet dancing at the resonance frequencies and departure from resonance. The droplet is detached at high voltages, and we provide a map for the detachable and nondetachable zones. The voltage is the dominant factor determining the droplet detachment; however, the AC frequency has notable influences on the critical voltage. The detachment is promoted when the AC frequency is within the region of the oscillation resonance (e.g., 20 {$<$} f {$<$} 75 Hz). In this region, the detaching process is not monotonic but instead, the droplet rebounds by several times before it is completely detached.},

  abstract = {Single-cell analysis serves as an important approach to study cell functions and interactions. Catering to the demand of Big Data Era, fast reactions for single cells and paralleled high-throughput analysis have become an urgent need. Microdroplet in microfluidics has advantages of modularity and integrity, as well as high throughput and sensitivity, which present great potential in the field of single-cell analysis. This review is carried out on three aspects to introduce microdroplet chips for single-cell analysis: droplet formation, droplet detection and practical functions. Structures of droplet formation are categorized into three types, including T-shaped channel, flow-involved channel and three-dimensional micro-vortice. The detection methods, including fluorescence, Raman spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy and electrochemical detection, are summarized from applications. Both pros and cons for existing techniques are reviewed and discussed. The functions of microdroplets-on-chip cover cell culture, nucleic acid test and cell identification. For each field, principles/mechanisms and/or schematic images are laconically introduced. Microdroplet in microfluidics has become a major research direction in single-cell analysis. With updated methods of droplet formation such as inertial ordering and micro-vortice, microdroplets-based biochips will expect high throughput detection and high-accuracy trace detection for clinical diagnosis in the near future.},

This paper reviews the recent advances related to microfluidic biosensors in the field of laboratory medicine, focusing on their applications in the above three areas. In cancer liquid biopsy, microfluidic biosensors facilitate the isolation, enrichment, and detection of tumor markers such as CTCs, ctDNA, miRNA, exosomes, and so on, providing support for early diagnosis, precise treatment, and prognostic assessment. In terms of pathogenic bacteria detection, microfluidic biosensors can achieve the rapid, highly sensitive, and highly specific detection of a variety of pathogenic bacteria, helping disease prevention and control as well as public health safety. Pertaining to the realm of POCT, microfluidic biosensors bring the convenient detection of a variety of diseases, such as tumors, infectious diseases, and chronic diseases, to primary health care. Future microfluidic biosensor research will focus on enhancing detection throughput, lowering costs, innovating new recognition elements and signal transduction methods, integrating artificial intelligence, and broadening applications to include home health care, drug discovery, food safety, and so on.},

  abstract = {Developments of portable biosensors for field-deployable detections have been increasingly important to control foodborne pathogens in regulatory environment and in early stage of outbreaks. Conventional cultivation and gene amplification methods require sophisticated instruments and highly skilled professionals; while portable biosensing devices provide more freedom for rapid detections not only in research laboratories but also in the field; however, their sensitivity and specificity are limited. Microfluidic methods have the advantage of miniaturizing instrumental size while integrating multiple functions and high-throughput capability into one streamlined system at low cost. Minimal sample consumption is another advantage to detect samples in different sizes and concentrations, which is important for the close monitoring of pathogens at consumer end. They improve measurement or manipulation of bacteria by increasing the ratio of functional interface of the device to the targeted biospecies and in turn reducing background interference. This article introduces the major active and passive microfluidic devices that have been used for bacteria sampling and biosensing. The emphasis is on particle-based sorting/enrichment methods with or without external physical fields applied to the microfluidic devices and on various biosensing applications reported for bacteria sampling. Three major fabrication methods for microfluidics are briefly discussed with their advantages and limitations. The applications of these active and passive microfluidic sampling methods in the past 5 years have been summarized, with the focus on Escherichia coli and Salmonella. The current challenges to microfluidic bacteria sampling are caused by the small size and nonspherical shape of various bacterial cells, which can induce unpredictable deviations in sampling and biosensing processes. Future studies are needed to develop rapid prototyping methods for device manufacturing, which can facilitate rapid response to various foodborne pathogen outbreaks.},

Emerging microfluidics, a highly miniaturized, automatic, and integrated technol-ogy, are a potential substitute for traditional methods in performing rapid, low-cost, accurate, and on-site diagnoses. Molecular diagnostics are widely used in microfluidic devices as the most effective approaches for pathogen detec-tion. This review summarizes the latest advances in microfluidics-based molecular diagnostics for infectious diseases from academic perspectives and industrial outlooks. First, we introduce the typical on-chip nucleic acid processes, including sample preprocessing, amplification, and signal read-out. Then, four categories of microfluidic platforms are compared with respect to features, merits, and demerits. We further discuss application of the digital assay in absolute nucleic acid quantification. Both the classic and recent microfluidics-based commercial molecular diagnostic devices are summarized as proof of the current market status. Finally, we propose future directions for microfluidics-based infectious disease diagnosis.},

CQDs show excellent physical and chemical properties like high crystallization, good dispersibility, photoluminescence properties. In particular, the small size, superconductivity, and rapid electron transfer of CQDs endow the CQDs-based composite with improved electric conductivity and catalytic activity. Besides, CQDs have abundant functional groups on the surface which could facilitate the preparation of multi-component electrical active catalysts. The interactions inside these multi-component catalysts may further enhance the catalytic performance by promoting charge transfer which plays an important role in electrochemistry. Most recent researches on CQDs have focused on their fluorescence characteristics and photocatalytic properties. This review will summarize the primary advances of CQDs in the synthetic methods, excellent physical and electronic properties, and application in electrocatalysis, including oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reduction (HER), and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR).},

There are very high requirements for the volume of single droplet in many biochemical applications. Droplet dispensing and splitting are two main operations to generate a single droplet in DMF. Therefore, the generation of droplets with high volume precision and accuracy in the two droplet operations is one of the keys to the efficient application of DMF in biochemical analysis. We have developed a novel droplet dispensing and splitting scheme where electrode geometry is optimized. The liquid column can contract in a regular shape, which keep the neck shape uniform and stable, and the position of pinch-off point was fixed; meanwhile, the liquid tail is eliminated before pinching off, so that the precision and accuracy of droplet volume were greatly improved. The increase in the radius of the cutting electrodes elongated the droplet neck and increased the neck curvature at the pinch-off point, which further effectively improved the precision and accuracy of droplet volume. The optimized droplet splitting scheme can also be applied to the droplet splitting with unequal volume effectively.},

Therefore, the different signal transduction mechanisms and Salmonella recognition elements are the key of the sensitivity, accuracy and specificity for the rapid detection methods. In this review, the bioreceptors for Salmonella were firstly summarized and described, then the current promising Salmonella rapid detection methods in foodstuffs with different signal transduction were objectively summarized and evaluated.

  abstract = {The current widespread of COVID-19 all over the world, which is caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, has again emphasized the importance of development of point-of-care (POC) diagnostics for timely prevention and control of the pandemic. Compared with labor- and time-consuming traditional diagnostic methods, POC diagnostics exhibit several advantages such as faster diagnostic speed, better sensitivity and specificity, lower cost, higher efficiency and ability of on-site detection. To achieve POC diagnostics, developing POC detection methods and correlated POC devices is the key and should be given top priority. The fast development of microfluidics, micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology, nanotechnology and materials science, have benefited the production of a series of portable, miniaturized, low cost and highly integrated POC devices for POC diagnostics of various infectious diseases. In this review, various POC detection methods for the diagnosis of infectious diseases, including electrochemical biosensors, fluorescence biosensors, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based biosensors, colorimetric biosensors, chemiluminiscence biosensors, surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based biosensors, and magnetic biosensors, were first summarized. Then, recent progresses in the development of POC devices including lab-on-a-chip (LOC) devices, lab-on-a-disc (LOAD) devices, microfluidic paper-based analytical devices ({$\mu$}PADs), lateral flow devices, miniaturized PCR devices, and isothermal nucleic acid amplification (INAA) devices, were systematically discussed. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives for the design and development of POC detection methods and correlated devices were presented. The ultimate goal of this review is to provide new insights and directions for the future development of POC diagnostics for the management of infectious diseases and contribute to the prevention and control of infectious pandemics like COVID-19.},

This paper proposes optimum electrode designs and carries out characterization experiments to demonstrate the reproducibility of on-chip droplet generation with no extra external apparatus. The coefficient variation of the volumes of consecutively dispensed droplets from a non-refilling reservoir can be limited to below 0.3\%, indicating the validity of the new electrode structure in practical applications.},

Therefore, allowing consumers to conduct timely and accurate detection of food safety when purchasing food has become a top priority globally. Although traditional detection methods have high accuracy and sensitivity, they cannot solve this problem due to the large instruments required and the stringent requirements for experimental conditions.

  abstract = {A hybrid structure gas sensor of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) decorated graphene (RGO-Gr) is designed for ultra-low concentration ammonia detection. The resistance value of the RGO-Gr hybrid is the indicator of the ammonia concentration and controlled by effective charge transport from RGO to graphene after ammonia molecule adsorption. In this hybrid material, RGO is the adsorbing layer to catch ammonia molecules and graphene is the conductive layer to effectively enhance charge/electron transport. Compared to a RGO gas sensor, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the RGO-Gr is increased from 22 to 1008. Meanwhile, the response of the RGO-Gr gas sensor is better than that of either a pristine graphene or RGO gas sensor. It is found that the RGO reduction time is related to the content of functional groups that directly reflect on the gas sensing properties of the sensor. The RGO-Gr gas sensor with 10 min reduction time has the best gas sensing properties in this type of sensor. The highest sensitivity is 2.88\% towards 0.5 ppm, and the ammonia gas detection limit is calculated to be 36 ppb.},

Microfluidic techniques require less sample, consume less reagents, and may enhance the sensitivity, precision, response time, and throughput of the analytical methods. The integration of multiple components and functionalities in microfluidic chips can further lead to fully automated Micro Total Analysis Systems (Lab-on-a-Chip). This review focuses on chemical and biochemical sensing of inorganic ions including electrolyte cations, heavy metal ions, and small anions in microfluidic devices. We provide an overview on how different optical and electrochemical ion sensing schemes based on liquid sensing phases or solid sensing phases can be coupled with microfluidics. Various microfluidics platforms including continuous-flow microfluidics, droplet microfluidics, digital microfluidics, centrifugal microfluidics, cell-based microfluidics, paper-based microfluidics, and wearable microfluidics are covered. The sensing principle, chip material, device fabrication, detector configuration, and analytical performance are presented for selected systems.

Herein, an overview of the latest advances in silicon-based integrated optofluidic label-free biosensing technologies relying on the efficient interactions between the evanescent light field at the functionalized surface and specifically bound analytes is presented. State-of-the-art technologies demonstrating label-free evanescent wave-based biomarker detection mainly encompass three device configurations, including on-chip waveguide-based interferometers, microring resonators, and photonic-crystal-based cavities. Moreover, up-to-date strategies for elevating the sensitivities and also simplifying the sensing processes are discussed. Emerging laboratory prototypes with advanced integration and packaging schemes incorporating automatic microfluidic components or on-chip optoelectronic devices lead to one significant step forward in real applications of decentralized diagnostics. Besides, particular attention is paid to currently commercialized label-free optical bioanalytical models on the market. Finally, the prospects are elaborated with several research routes toward chip-scale, low-cost, highly sensitive, multi-functional, and user-friendly bioanalytical systems benefiting to global healthcare.},

This research expands the two-dimensional conventional digital microfluidic architecture into a three-dimensional architecture. The concept relies on the possibility that back and forth motions between open and covered regions are possible under electrowetting actuation. Two face-to-face plates based on "microelectrode dot array" (MEDA) architecture form the foundation of the two-layer microfluidic operations and a dual open/covered hybrid design adds the inter layer microfluidic connection to complete the three-dimensional system. By combining the advantages of the open/covered systems, a three-dimensional digital microfluidics may achieve better droplet routing capabilities and fit more functions into a given footprint.},

  abstract = {InterDigitated Electrodes (IDEs) is a generic platform for a wide range of diverse applications with their implementation in sensing modules being a major one. We propose the use of IDCs with deep sub-micron critical dimension; equally spaced electrodes of 200 nm width for enhanced sensing performance and also the method of fabrication thereof. The transducer configuration was studied theoretically with a finite element method simulation by using COMSOL Multiphysics. The miniaturization of the IDEs up to 200 nm critical dimension with an adequate sensing area for the deposition of the polymeric materials is considered beneficial in terms of sensitivity gain. The IDCs were designed to deliver capacitance values of few pF in order to be compatible with already developed miniaturized low-power readout electronics. The transducers fabrication is performed with conventional microelectronic/micromachining processing and then coated with several semi-selective polymeric films. Besides the fabrication of multiple sensor arrays (chips) on the same silicon wafer, the miniaturization offers the integration with the readout electronics on the same chip. The evaluation of the sensing performance of the semi-selective polymer coated sensors is performed upon exposure to vapours of pure and binary mixtures of VOCs and humidity in various concentrations. The sensors demonstrate high sensitivity to the examined analytes as a result of the miniaturization, while their semi-selectivity is a key for applications in complex vapour environment discrimination.},

  abstract = {Wetting and electrowetting (EW) on corrugated substrates are studied experimentally and theoretically in this paper. On corrugated substrates, because of the anisotropy of surface morphology, the droplet shows an elliptical shape and the spreading velocities in different directions are different. Spreading of a droplet is usually controlled not only by the surface tensions but also by hemi-wicking. Our experimental results indicated that liquids along the grooves propagate much faster than those in the direction vertical to the grooves. However, spreading in both directions obeys the same scaling law of l{$\sim$}t4/5. EW on corrugated substrates reveals some differences with that on smooth surfaces. The change of contact angles with an applied voltage follows a linear relationship in two stages instead of the smooth curve on flat surfaces. There exists a critical voltage which divides the two stages. The transition of a droplet from the Cassie state to the Wenzel state on corrugated substrates was also discussed. The extended EW equation was derived with the free energy minimization approach, and the anisotropic factor was introduced. From the extended equation, it is found that EW is affected by the anisotropic factor significantly. For the smooth surfaces, the extended EW equation will degenerate to the classical Lippmann-Young equation. Our research may help us to understand the wetting and EW of droplets on corrugated substrates and assist in their design for practical applications.},

The river water quality was studied at six selected stations to represent different localities with varying anthropogenic discharge. Physicochemical parameters of the samples were measured pH, temperature, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, salinity, ammoniacal nitrogen, biochemical and chemical oxygen demand, suspended solids, nitrate and phosphate following standard methods. The mean values of the measured parameters were compared with Malaysian National Standard for Drinking Water Quality (NSDWQ) and Water Quality Index Department of Environment (DOE WQI). Present level concentration of ammoniacal nitrogen, biochemical and chemical oxygen demand were under the categorization of Class II and III while suspended solids were categorized in Class IV in wet season. Mean WQI for Bertam River in dry season (78 Class II) was slightly better than in wet season (74 Class III). Thus it was indicated at meteorological change such as rainfalls having significant negative influence on study site. Statistical analysis of one way ANOVA test indicates that all measured parameters are shown significant difference except for pH, DO, salinity, COD and ammoniacal nitrogen. In conclusion, present the water quality of Bertam River should be extensively monitored since deterioration of water quality was clearly observed. Therefore, some sort of integrated river water management and good practice agriculture scheme should be implemented.},

Highly reversible electrowetting with very low hysteresis (2-4deg) is demonstrated on the Teflon{\textregistered}-coated surfaces. The actuation voltage for 30deg contact angle change (from 148degto118deg) is largely reduced to 25V by using a high-dielectric-constant tantalum oxide film as the dielectric layer. The effect of trapped charges in the dielectric film on the electrowetting is observed and measured. The rise and fall times of the electrowetting actuation are inversely proportional to the droplet diameter and as short as 0.1-0.2ms for a 50{$\mu$}mdia droplet. The actuation reliability is tested, and a long-time operation is achieved in an oil environment.},

  abstract = {The development of a rapid and reliable polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for point-of-care (POC) diagnosis is crucial for the timely identification of pathogens. Microfluidics, which involves the manipulation of small volumes of fluidic samples, has been shown to be an ideal approach for POC analysis. Among the various microfluidic platforms available, digital microfluidics (DMF) offers high degree of configurability in manipulating {$\mu$}L/nL-scale liquid and achieving automation. However, the successful implementation of ultrafast PCR on DMF platforms presents challenges due to inherent system instability. In this study, we developed a robust and ultrafast PCR in 3.7--5 min with a detection sensitivity comparable to conventional PCR. Specifically, the implementation of the pincer heating scheme homogenises the temperature within a drop. The utilization of a {$\mu$}m-scale porous hydrophobic membrane suppresses the formation of bubbles under high temperatures. The design of a groove around the high-temperature zone effectively mitigates the temperature interference. The integration of a soluble sensor into the droplets provides an accurate and instant in-drop temperature sensing. We envision that the fast, robust, sensitive, and automatic DMF system will empower the POC testing for infectious diseases.},

The application of any fabrication solution that offers those advantages will have a major impact on the manufacturing of modern sensors. To address this issue, a 3D printed Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) temperature sensor is presented in this paper. The modelling and analysis of such a sensor have been performed for both aluminium and copper electrodes using COMSOL software. In total, 4 different sensing structures, 2 each for both aluminium and copper electrodes based one-port resonators, are designed and analysed for their application in temperature sensing. The resulting responses of those sensors are approximately 2.19\,MHz and 424.01\,MHz frequency ranges. The novelty lies in the possibility of mass-producing such a sensor using additive manufacturing will have a direct impact in the areas where conventional electronics cannot be utilized.},

Aiming to decrease driving voltages and improve driving effectiveness, this paper studies the modeling, simulation, and optimization of EWOD devices. The theoretical model is refined mainly in consideration of the saturation effect of the contact angle and then verified by both simulation and experiments. As a design guide to decrease the driving voltage, a theoretical criterion of droplet splitting, the most difficult one among four basic droplet manipulations, is developed and then verified by experimental results. Moreover, a novel sigmoid electrode shape is found by the optimization method based on finite element analysis and achieves better driving effectiveness and consistent bidirectional driving capability, compared with the existing electrode shapes. Taken together, this paper provides an EWOD analysis and optimization method featuring a lower voltage and a better effectiveness and opens up opportunities for optimization designs in various EWOD-based applications.},

The designed electrode is in a meander-line shape and covered by an insulator. On the one hand, when a potential difference is applied along the electrode, power dissipated by the resistance of the electrode causes droplet heating. On the other hand, when an electric field exists across the insulator above the electrode, the charges stored in the capacitor alter the surface wettability and pump droplet. Manipulated droplets were placed between parallel plates with passivated versatile microelectrodes on the bottom plate and a Teflon-coated blank ITO on the top plate. We successfully applied a DC voltage at the two terminals of the meander-line electrode to heat up the electrode as well as the droplet above. Besides, pumping droplets by EWOD was demonstrated by applying a proper AC voltage between the electrode on the bottom plate and the ITO on the top plate.

  abstract = {Abstract             The results of investigations into performing DNA sequencing chemistry on a picoliter-scale electrowetting digital microfluidic platform are reported. Pyrosequencing utilizes pyrophosphate produced during nucleotide base addition to initiate a process ending with detection through a chemiluminescence reaction using firefly luciferase. The intensity of light produced during the reaction can be quantified to determine the number of bases added to the DNA strand. The logic-based control and discrete fluid droplets of a digital microfluidic device lend themselves well to the pyrosequencing process. Bead-bound DNA is magnetically held in a single location, and wash or reagent droplets added or split from it to circumvent product dilution. Here we discuss the dispensing, control, and magnetic manipulation of the paramagnetic beads used to hold target DNA. We also demonstrate and characterize the picoliter-scale reaction of luciferase with adenosine triphosphate to represent the detection steps of pyrosequencing and all necessary alterations for working on this scale.},

  abstract = {Foodborne pathogens endanger human health. Therefore, sensitive and accurate detection assays are key for their prevention and control. Microdroplet digital nucleic acid platforms can achieve single-molecule sensitivity in the presence of specialized instrumentation for generating homogenized monodisperse droplets, expensive thermal cyclers, high temperature-resistant reagents, and time-consuming multistep operations in the lab. Argonaute (Ago), an emerging next-generation gene editing tool, can be used for the detection of pathogen genetic information. Current reports mainly adopt the high temperature-dependent thermophilic Ago in stepwise nucleic acid detection, which hinders its applications in ultrasensitive digital detection. Here, we expressed and purified the mesophilic Clostridium butyricum Argonaute (CbAgo) and developed a polydisperse microdroplet reactors-assist asymmetric recombinase polymerase amplification driven CbAgo report digital detection platform (DRAGON). It realized the signal-enhanced nucleic acid amplification and CbAgo report compatibility in novel low-cost and ultrafast-prepared polydisperse microdroplet reactors. The microdroplet reactor area and fluorescence intensity were combined to establish a dual parameter-based random forest machine learning model, which achieved high sensitivity (1 CFU/mL) and efficiency ({$<$}45 min) for detecting pathogens. This is the first time that mesophilic Ago was used to achieve true sensitive one-step and one-pot low-temperature digital nucleic acid detection. Our system accomplished multiplex detection in one-step and one-pot with a single nuclease which is impossible for CRISPR/Cas system and thermophilic Ago-based stepwise platforms. DRAGON represents the next-generation platform for pathogen detection based on gene editing tools and intelligent digital nucleic acid detection system.},

This paper discussed the current institutional framework for planning and development in Pahang River Basin, Malaysia. This case study applied the literature background study and field survey. There is lack of provision to give a clear mandate for public participation in the local planning level and public representative could not be guaranteed in the local planning committee. Based on this Pahang River Basin case study, this paper further argues that the participation of local community needs to be strengthened from consultation level to the involvement level. This could be approached through joint management concept. Integrated approach on water resources management of river basin requires a full commitment from all levels of stakeholders. However, the understanding of the characteristics of the river basin both from the natural and human system aspects could not be neglected in planning and development process.},

Conventional methods of food analysis, including mass spectroscopy (MS), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE), are time-consuming, labor intensive, and require skilled technicians.

It is based on an improved version of a 90 nm CMOS integrated circuit featuring a nanocapacitor array, readout and A/D conversion circuitry, and an FPGA-based interface board with NIOS II soft processor. We describe the chip's processing, the mounting, the microfluidics, the temperature control system, as well as the calibration and compensation procedures to reduce systematic errors, which altogether make up a complete quantitative sensor platform. Capacitance spectra recorded up to 70 MHz are shown and successfully compared to predictions by FEM numerical simulations in the Poisson-Drift-Diffusion formalism. They demonstrate the ability of the chip to reach high upper frequency of operation, thus overcoming the low-frequency Debye screening limit at nearly physiological salt concentrations in the electrolyte, and allowing for detection of events occurring beyond the extent of the electrical double layer. Furthermore, calibrated multifrequency measurements enable quantitative recording of capacitance spectra, whose features can reveal new properties of the analytes. The scalability of the electrode dimensions, interelectrode pitch and size of the array make this sensing approach of quite general applicability, even in a non-bio context (e.g. gas sensing).},

Many innovative e-nose technologies have provided solutions and applications to a wide variety of complex biomedical and healthcare problems. The purposes of this review are to present a comprehensive analysis of past and recent biomedical research findings and developments of electronic-nose sensor technologies, and to identify current and future potential e-nose applications that will continue to advance the effectiveness and efficiency of biomedical treatments and healthcare services for many years. An abundance of electronic-nose applications has been developed for a variety of healthcare sectors including diagnostics, immunology, pathology, patient recovery, pharmacology, physical therapy, physiology, preventative medicine, remote healthcare, and wound and graft healing. Specific biomedical e-nose applications range from uses in biochemical testing, blood-compatibility evaluations, disease diagnoses, and drug delivery to monitoring of metabolic levels, organ dysfunctions, and patient conditions through telemedicine. This paper summarizes the major electronic-nose technologies developed for healthcare and biomedical applications since the late 1980s when electronic aroma detection technologies were first recognized to be potentially useful in providing effective solutions to problems in the healthcare industry.},

  abstract = {The steady increase in global consumption puts a strain on agriculture and might lead to a decrease in food quality. Currently used techniques of food analysis are often labour-intensive and time-consuming and require extensive sample preparation. For that reason, there is a demand for novel methods that could be used for rapid food quality assessment. A technique based on the use of an array of chemical sensors for holistic analysis of the sample's headspace is called electronic olfaction. In this article, a prototype of a portable, modular electronic nose intended for food analysis is described. Using the SVM method, it was possible to classify samples of poultry meat based on shelf-life with 100\% accuracy, and also samples of rapeseed oil based on the degree of thermal degradation with 100\% accuracy. The prototype was also used to detect adulterations of extra virgin olive oil with rapeseed oil with 82\% overall accuracy. Due to the modular design, the prototype offers the advantages of solutions targeted for analysis of specific food products, at the same time retaining the flexibility of application. Furthermore, its portability allows the device to be used at different stages of the production and distribution process.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Droplet control through the use of light-induced thermocapillary effects has recently garnered attention due to its non-intrusive and multifunctional nature. An important issue in droplet control is the estimation of the thermocapillary force. The purpose of the present study is to estimate the thermocapillary force and propose empirical equations between the force and simply measurable key parameters such as droplet diameter and power of heat source. In addition, we aim to shift the droplet trajectory and develop an on-demand droplet routing system based on the estimation of the thermocapillary force. We illuminated a continuous phase with a 532\,nm laser beam to minimize possible damage or property changes to target molecules contained within droplets. A mixture of light-absorbing material and oleic acid was used for the continuous phase fluid, while deionized water (DI water) was used for the dispersed phase fluid. We proposed empirical equations to estimate the thermocapillary force, which was then applied to precise droplet shifting and routing. We found that the shifting distance was linearly proportional to the thermocapillary force, and that an on-demand droplet routing system resulted in a success rate greater than 95\%.},

  abstract = {Fast advancements of microfabrication processes in past two decades have reached to a fairly matured stage that we can manufacture a wide range of microfluidic devices. At present, the main challenge is the control of nanoscale properties on the surface of lab-on-a-chip to satisfy the need for biomedical applications. For example, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) is a commonly used material for microfluidic circuitry, yet the hydrophobic nature of PDMS surface suffers serious nonspecific protein adsorption. Thus the current major efforts are focused on surface molecular property treatments for satisfying specific needs in handling macro functional molecules. Reviewing surface modifications of all types of materials used in microfluidics will be too broad. This review will only summarize recent advances in nonbiofouling PDMS surface modification strategies applicable to microfluidic technology and classify them into two main categories: (1) physical approach including physisorption of charged or amphiphilic polymers and copolymers, as well as (2) chemical approach including self assembled monolayer and thick polymer coating. Pros and cons of a collection of available yet fully exploited surface modification methods are briefly compared among subcategories.},

In particular, acoustofluidic separation of biological targets from complex fluids has proven to be a powerful tool due to the label-free, biocompatible, and contact-free nature of the technology. By carefully designing and tuning the applied acoustic field, cells and other bioparticles can be isolated with high yield, purity, and biocompatibility. Recent advances in acoustofluidics, such as the development of automated, point-of-care devices for isolating sub-micron bioparticles, address many of the limitations of conventional separation tools. More importantly, advances in the research lab are quickly being adopted to solve clinical problems. In this review article, we discuss working principles of acoustofluidic separation, compare different approaches of acoustofluidic separation, and provide a synopsis of how it is being applied in both traditional applications, such as blood component separation, cell washing, and fluorescence activated cell sorting, as well as emerging applications, including circulating tumor cell and exosome isolation.},

Selective transport of diverse droplets, particularly in another liquid phase environment with controlled directions, is still challenging. In this work, we propose an electric-field gradient-driven droplet directional transport platform facilitated by a robust lubricant surface. On the platform, we clearly demonstrated a liquid-inherent critical frequency-dominated selective transport of diverse droplets and a driving mechanism transition from electrowetting to liquid dielectrophoresis. Enlightened by the Kelvin-Helmholtz theory, we first realize the directional droplet transport in another liquid phase whenever a permittivity difference exists. Co-transport of multiple droplets and various combinations of droplet types, as well as multifunctional droplet transport modes, are realized based on the presented powerful electric-field gradient-driven platform, overcoming the limitations of the surrounding environment, liquid conductivity, and intrinsic solid-liquid wetting property existing in traditional droplet transport strategies. This work may inspire new applications in liquid separation, multiphase microfluidic manipulation, chemical reagent selection, and so on.},

The experimental result reveals that the graphene/PANI sensor exhibits much higher sensitivity (ca. 5 times) than that of PANI, and shows approximate linearity over a wide range of concentrations from 1 to 6400 ppm. The detection limit of graphene/PANI sensor (ca. 1 ppm) is lower than that of PANI (ca. 10 ppm) for NH3. This shows that sensitivity of graphene/PANI sensor for NH3 detection is enhanced by the graphene added into PANI. The result is partially supported by experimental data that the NH3 adsorption of quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) coated graphene/PANI is larger than that of PANI. Meanwhile, the structure and morphology of the synthesized products are characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), brunauer emmett tellerand (BET), ultraviolet--visible spectroscopy (UV--vis), photoluminescence (PL), X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively.},

  abstract = {Electrically-driven droplet-based digital microfluidics analog to integrated chips has undergone tremendous growth; however, its applications are restricted due to high-voltage requirement and lack of versatile droplet manipulation methods. We propose liquid dielectrophoresis on electret (L-DEPOE) as a CMOS-driven general droplet manipulation method for various conductive or dielectric droplets. By mimicking electric relays to operate the electret as a virtual voltage source with a low-voltage signal, L-DEPOE dramatically reduces the driving voltage to only 5 VDC for transporting oil droplets. The driving force in liquid dielectrophoresis (L-DEP) is compared with dielectrophoresis (DEP) and electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) in a unified approach by introducing the concept of electropolarization in non-uniform electric fields. In this scenario, molecular electropolarization forces act in dielectric liquid bulk for L-DEP, in the electrical double layer (EDL) near the three-phase contact line for EWOD. The vanishing of electropolarization forces may contribute to the contact angle (CA) saturation in EWOD. The apparent CA reduction in EWOD is formulated within the classical electromechanical framework as a consequence of electropolarization forces in the EDL. To electrically manipulate various liquids, we transported both conductive water and dielectric oil droplets in the same L-DEPOE configuration using external voltages, and we propose a modified configuration for tuning liquid shapes. Improved results on electret charge stability are presented, and approaches to enhance electret performances and droplet motion velocity are analyzed based on qualitative analysis and quantitative simulation.},

By employing electret as a virtual voltage source embedded into microfluidics for the first time, a dielectric droplet between two electrodes can be transported by liquid dielectrophoresis (L-DEP) force when switching an external capacitor between electrodes using a manual switch or low-voltage-driven relays. A circuit model and force analysis for L-DEPOE are established to clarify its working principle and quantitatively depict the droplet motion. Nanoliter dielectric droplets have been transported reversibly between the two electrodes with a manual switch or five DCV-driven relays in microfabricated proof-of-concept prototypes. The surface voltage stability of electret in liquid is examined with different polymer materials and coatings. Furthermore, the droplet motion traces in a L-DEPOE device are compared with numerical simulation results, indicating the important role of contact angle hysteresis for nanoliter droplets.},

In this review, we have summarized the current state-of-the-art development on the fabrication of high-performance supercapacitors. From the electrode material perspective, a variety of materials have been explored for advanced electrode materials with smart material-design strategies such as carbonaceous materials, metal compounds and conducting polymers. Proper nanostructures are engineered to provide sufficient electroactive sites and enhance the kinetics of ion and electron transport. Besides, new-concept supercapacitors have been developed for practical application. Microsupercapacitors and fiber supercapacitors have been explored for portable and compact electronic devices. Subsequently, we have introduced Li-/Na-ion supercapacitors composed of battery-type electrodes and capacitor-type electrode. Integrated energy devices are also explored by incorporating supercapacitors with energy conversion systems for sustainable energy storage. In brief, this review provides a comprehensive summary of recent progress on electrode materials design and burgeoning devices constructions for high-performance supercapacitors.},

This review critically critiques the state-of-the-art designs of microfluidic devices and their applications in food processing, and identifies the key research trends and future research directions for maximizing the value of microfluidic technology. Capillary, planar, and terrace droplet generation systems are currently used in the design of microfluidic devices, each with their strengths and weaknesses as applied in food processing, for emulsification, food safety measurements, and bioactive compound extraction. Conventional channel-based microfluidic devices are prone to clogging, and have high labor costs and low productivity, and their ``directional pressure'' restricts scaling-up capabilities. These disadvantages can be overcome by using ``inside-out centrifugal force'' and the new generation continuous flow thin-film microfluidic Vortex Fluidic Device (VFD) which facilitates translating laboratory processing into commercial products.

  abstract = {Recent advancement in the printed circuit board (PCB) industry has enabled the production of highly sophisticated electronic substrates at high-resolution and low production cost. These boards make an ideal platform for producing microfluidic devices for lab-on-a-chip and point-of-care applications, since such devices require a high degree of integration, something that is critically lacking in current technology. We propose an alternative approach for fabricating microfluidic devices by using PCB as a substrate to produce high precision, highly integrated microfluidic systems. We report the development of new materials (polyurethane and 1002F polymer) and techniques for successful integration of microfluidics with PCBs. Prototypes of PCB-based 1002F and polyurethane microfluidics were fabricated with electronic components embedded for integration (resistors, LEDs, temperature sensors), enabling on-board thermal control and detection, and optical imaging. In this paper, optical imaging was presented as a demonstration for such on-board functional control. Electroosmotic flow was measured in microchannels made from both materials, demonstrating the suitability of these materials for biochemical and electrochemical applications.},

Many linear-shaped CNTs were well dispersed and twining around Cu2O spheres because of the synergistic effect between CNTs and Cu2O spheres, the as-prepared Cu2O/CNTs composite exhibits high electrocatalytic activity and specific surface area. Subsequently, the fabricated Cu2O/ CNTs composite-based electrochemical sensor shows high sensitivity for detecting nitrite with an ultra-low detection limit of 0.018 nM within a wide linear concentration range (from 0.1 nM to 1 mM) of nitrite ions. The constructed sensor also shows profitable anti-interference ability, good reproducibility, stability, and good applicability. All of these results illustrate that the as-prepared electrochemical sensor has wide potential application in the fields of water determination.},

  abstract = {Foodborne pathogenic bacteria have become a worldwide threat to human health, and rapid and sensitive bacterial detection methods are urgently needed. In this study, a facile microfluidic chip was developed and combined with recombinase-aided amplification (RAA) for rapid and sensitive detection of Salmonella typhimurium using a non-contact eddy heater for dynamic lysis of bacterial cells and a 3D-printed fan-shaped active mixer for continuous-flow mixing. First, the bacterial sample was injected into the chip to flow through the spiral channel coiling around an iron rod under an alternating electromagnetic field, resulting in the dynamic lysis of bacterial cells by this non-contact eddy heater to release their nucleic acids. After cooling to {\textasciitilde}75 {\textopenbullet}C, these nucleic acids were continuous-flow mixed with magnetic silica beads using the fan-shaped mixer and captured in the separation chamber using a magnet. Finally, the captured nucleic acids were eluted by the eluent from the beads to flow into the detection chamber, followed by RAA detection of nucleic acids to determine the bacterial amount. Under the optimal conditions, this microfluidic chip was able to quantitatively detect Salmonella typhimurium from 1.1 {\texttimes} 102 to 1.1 {\texttimes} 105 CFU/mL in 40 min with a detection limit of 89 CFU/mL and might be prospective to offer a simple, low-cost, fast and specific bacterial detection technique for ensuring food safety.},

Each receiving LC circuit connected to the EWOD/DEP electrode is designed to have a different resonant frequency. When the input frequency is close to one of the resonant frequencies of receiving LC circuits, the induced voltage on the corresponding EWOD/DEP electrode will increase due to the resonance. Therefore, electrodes can be selectively and sequentially activated to provide sufficient EWOD or DEP force to manipulate the droplet or liquid by modulating the input frequency. Unlike previously reported wireless EWOD or DEP devices powered through one-to-one transmitter--receiver coupling, the transmitting inductor in the one-to-many transmitter--receiver coupling design proposed here is much larger than the total sizes of receiving inductors. Therefore, receiving inductors can be easily covered and coupled by the transmitting inductor. Here, droplet transport, splitting, and merging are successfully demonstrated using 5 receiving LC circuits at different input frequencies (1210--1920 Hz). Liquid pumping with multiple electrodes by wireless DEP is also demonstrated using 5 receiving LC circuits at higher input frequencies (51.2--76.1 kHz). Furthermore, liquid pumping with a continuous meandered electrode by wireless DEP is demonstrated through the resonant frequency shifting effect. It shows that the liquid pumping distance on a continuous electrode also can be tuned by proper frequency modulation.},

Array processing of these droplets hinges on the competence of the sorting and integration into the fluidic system. Recent technological advances only allow droplets to be actively sorted at the rate of kilohertz or less. In this review, we present state-of-the-art technologies which are implemented to efficiently sort droplets. We classify the concepts according to the type of energy implemented into the system.

At Reynolds numbers far below 1 (Re {$\ll$} 1), the fluid inertia can be neglected. For the steady flow of incompressible Newtonian fluids, it approaches linear Stokes flow. At intermediate Re, there exists a weak-inertia flow regime where secondary flows such as Dean vortices are accessible for microfluidic manipulations. Apart from the fluid inertia, other nonlinear factors such as the non-Newtonian fluid properties, concurrent flow of dissimilar fluids, compliant fluidic structures and stimuli-responsive materials can also cause intriguing flow behaviours. Through proper designs, they can be applied for a variety of microfluidic components including mixers, valves, oscillators, stabilizers and auto-regulators               etc.               , greatly enriching the microfluidic flow control and manipulation strategies.

The designs of typical nonlinear microfluidic devices, their working mechanisms, key applications, and the perspective of their future developments will be discussed.

  abstract = {Digital Microfluidic Biochip (DMFB) has drawn lots of attention today. It offers a promising platform for various kinds of biochemical experiments. DMFB that uses crossreferencing technology to drive droplets movements scales down the control pin number on chip, which not only brings down manufacturing cost but also allows large-scale chip design. However, the cross-referencing scheme that imposes different voltage on rows and columns to activate the cells, might cause severe electrode interference, and hence greatly decreases the degree of parallelism of droplet routing. Most of the previous papers get a directaddressing result first, and then convert to cross-referencing compatible result. This paper proposes a new method that solves the droplet routing problem on cross-referencing biochip directly. Experimental results on public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method in comparison with the latest work on this problem.},

In this paper, we solve the placement and droplet routing problem in cross-referencing biochips. In these biochips, the electrodes are addressed in a row-column manner, which may cause electrode interference that prevents simultaneous movements of multiple droplets. We propose a routing algorithm that solves the droplet routing problem directly. A two-coloring graph-theoretic method is used in our router to detect and prevent the electrode interference. In addition, we propose an integer linear programming based method to solve the placement problem. Our method considers the characteristics of cross-referencing biochips and is aware of droplet routing. Real-life benchmarks are used to evaluate the proposed methods. Compared with previous works, our router improves on average 4\% in routing time and 58\% in runtime. It can route all the benchmarks within the time limits, while the latest work fails in some cases. Moreover, experimental results show that by running our router on the placement result generated by our method and those generated by the latest work, an average improvement of 11\%, 29\%, 54\%, and 46\% in the maximum routing time, average routing time, stalling steps, and cell usage can be achieved.},

  abstract = {The determination of pH is of paramount importance in environmental, pharmaceutical, and medicinal sciences, etc., for accurate controlling, monitoring, and adjusting whole processes on microscale and macroscale. Therefore, the pH measurements have drawn continuous efforts from a great deal of research. The bulk pH determination can tackle part of the demands from laboratories and industrial applications. However, more and more studies have started to pay more attention to microfluidic-based pH sensing by integrating with metal oxides and solid-state-based pH sensing applications. This review paper focuses on the recent development of pH sensing, the mechanisms of pH sensing, a few common pH sensors, and microfluidic-based pH determinations from the aspects of fabrication techniques to the various applications in biology, environmental study, and food safety. The future trends of pH sensing, as well as microfluidic-based pH sensing, were discussed as well at the end of this review.},

It requires that run-time diagnosis and fault recovery can be made possible in such systems. This paper describes a droplet routing technique for a fault-tolerant digital microfluidic platform. This technique features handling of many microfluidic operations simultaneously and uses on-chip sensors for diagnosis at run-time. Once a fault is detected during the droplet routing, recovery procedures will be started-up immediately. Faulty units on the chip will be marked and isolated from the array so that the remaining droplets can still be routed along a fault-free path to their destinations. This method guarantees a non-stop fault-tolerant operation for very large microfluidic arrays.},

However, it is challenging for droplet reactors to be used in practical applications due to the difficulty of uniformly mixing ultrasmall volumes of samples and the lack of rapid and high-precision detection protocols. Here, we have developed an acoustic droplet system for rapid and efficient biological detection and chemical screening. By employing acoustic wave devices, rapid and nondestructive uniform mixing of {$\sim$}nL-{$\mu$}L droplets can be achieved. By the acoustophoretic force, the perturbation of the droplets can quickly concentrate the sample and increase the detection limit by five times. Through the color reaction and the coordinated detection of photodiodes, we have developed a biomarker detection protocol with short reaction time and high accuracy. As a proof-of-concept application, we demonstrated that this system can detect ultrasmall or low-abundance samples faster and more accurately, highlighting its wide application in analytical chemistry, basic research, and clinical medicine.},

However, most microdevices only allow limited steps, such as DNA amplification on the chip, while sample preparation, such as lysis and DNA extraction, is conducted off the chip using the traditional method. In this study, an all-in-one platform was developed, which incorporated all necessary procedures for nucleic acid detection. Our on-chip DNA extraction method utilized the magnetic bead-based technology on a hybrid channel-digital microfluidics (C-DMF) microdevice. It yielded high recovery rates, varying from 88.43\% to 95.83\%, with pathogen concentrations of 103--106 CFU/mL. In particular, the on-chip method exhibited significantly higher efficacy compared to the traditional off-chip manual method, for the DNA extraction of E. coli and S. aureus, representing Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively, at a sample concentration of 103 CFU/mL. To address the need for rapid and accessible diagnostics, colorimetric LAMP amplification was integrated into the proposed microdevice. The results were visually detectable with the naked eye, making it user-friendly for non-specialists. In addition, this platform demonstrated impressive sensitivity in simultaneously detecting common foodborne pathogens in spiked meat samples, achieving the LOD of 102--103 CFU/mL. The entire process, from sampling to result, was fully automated and only required approximately 60 min, offering promising applicability in resource-limited and on-site testing scenarios.},

  abstract = {Bacterial infections often result in severe health conditions, including infectious shock, sepsis, and multi-organ dysfunction, posing significant diagnostic and treatment challenges. Therefore, a rapid, multiplexed identification is urgently needed to accurately detect a broad spectrum of bacteria, guiding precise antibiotic prescriptions. Here, we introduce a cost-effective digital microfluidic platform designed for multiplexed detection of bacterial infections, which is referred to as MiND-DMF. This system integrates DNA extraction, RPA amplification, and CRISPR-based bacterial detection, enabling the efficient identification of six infectious bacteria: E. coli, S. aureus, MRSA, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae. The entire diagnostic process is completed in just 55 minutes at 37{$^\circ$}C and is compatible with human reference genes. MiND-DMF exhibits robust anti-interference capabilities, making it ideal for detecting bacteria in different tissue fluids. In spiked samples, the platform demonstrated a detection limit of 100 CFU/mL, highlighting its great sensitivity and quantification capability. In clinical evaluations, MiND-DMF achieved 100\% sensitivity and 98-100\% specificity compared to the hospital's gold-standard method. The system analyzed 50 samples from various tissue sources, accurately pinpointing the bacteria responsible for infections. This information guides the administration of appropriate antibiotic treatment. Notably, K.pneumoniae and P.aeruginosa are the leading causes of nosocomial infections in ICU, with K.pneumoniae commonly associated with urinary tract infections and E.coli frequently isolated from appendiceal pus. Additionally, H.influenzae primarily affects children under 5-years-old. MiND-DMF's efficiency and precision support monitoring the origins of hospital-acquired bacterial infections, assisting physicians in prescribing targeted antibiotics and enhancing infection prevention and control strategies.},

However, concerns for digital microfluidic platforms based on low-cost printed circuit boards, such as the scalability of the electrode array and the reliability of the device operation, should be addressed before high throughput and fully automatic applications can be realized. In this work we report the progress in addressing those issues by using active-matrix circuitry to automatically drive a large electrode array with enhanced device reliability. We describe the design and the fabrication of a robust and scalable active-matrix driven digital microfluidic platform based on printed-circuit board technology. Reliable actuation of aqueous and organic droplets is achieved using a free-standing double-layer hydrophobic membrane. To demonstrate the versatility of the digital microfluidic platform, a pentapeptide is synthesized on the device within 30 minutes. With these improvements, a fully automatic, scalable, robust, reusable, and low-cost digital microfluidic platform capable of parallel manipulation of a large number of droplets can find numerous applications in chemical engineering, bioengineering and biomedical engineering.},

Bioassays steps are mapped to a sequence of microfludic operations on a two-dimensional array of electrodes. The number of independent input pins used to control the electrodes is an important cost-driver, especially for disposable PCB devices that are being developed for clinical and point-of-care diagnostics. We review two design-automation methods for such pin-count-constrained biochips. The first design procedure relies on a droplet-trace-based array partitioning scheme and an efficient pin assignment technique, referred to as the ``Connect-5 algorithm''. The second pin-constrained design method relies on ``cross-referencing'' addressing based on ``rows'' and ``columns'' to access electrodes. An efficient droplet manipulation method is presented for this cross-referencing technique based on a mapping of the droplet-movement problem to the clique-partitioning problem from graph theory.},

This emerging technology combines electronics with biology to open new application areas such as point-of-care diagnosis, on-chip DNA analysis, and automated drug discovery. We propose a design automation method for pin-constrained biochips that manipulate nanoliter volumes of discrete droplets on a microfluidic array. In contrast to the direct-addressing scheme that has been studied thus far in the literature, we assign a small number of independent control pins to a large number of electrodes in the biochip, thereby reducing design complexity and product cost. The design procedure relies on a droplet-trace-based array partitioning scheme and an efficient pin assignment technique, referred to as the ``Connect-5 algorithm.'' The proposed method is evaluated using a set of multiplexed bioassays.},

However, the effectiveness of recently proposed test techniques for biochips is limited by the fact that current design methods do not consider testability. We introduce the concept of design-for-testability (DFT) for microfluidic biochips and propose a DFT method that incorporates a test plan into the fluidic operations of a target bioassay protocol. By using the testability-aware bioassay protocol as an input to the biochip design tool, the proposed DFT method ensures a high level of testability, defined as the percentage of the electrodes or functional units on the synthesized chip that can be effectively tested. We evaluate the DFT method using a representative multiplexed bioassay and the polymerase chain reaction.},

  abstract = {Gray scale consistency in pixels was extremely important for electrowetting displays (EWDs). However, traditional electrowetting display driving waveforms could not obtain a pixel aperture ratio consistency, which led to the occurrence of gray inconsistency even if it was the same driving waveform. In addition, the oil backflow caused by charge trapping could not be sustained. Therefore, a multi-direct current (DC) overdriving waveform for gray scale consistency was proposed in this paper, which could effectively improve the performance of EWDs. The driving waveform was divided into a start-up driving phase and a stable driving phase. The stable driving phase was composed of a square wave with a duty cycle of 79\% and a frequency of 43 Hz. Subsequently, an overdriving pulse was also introduced in the stable driving phase. The multi-DC driving waveform for gray scale consistency was applied to a thin film transistor-electrowetting display (TFT-EWD). The average difference between increasing driving voltage and decreasing driving voltage was only 2.79\%. The proposed driving waveform has an aperture ratio of 3.7 times at low voltages compared to DC driving.},

Firstly, a brief introduction is presented on both the theory of EWOD actuation and the types of droplet motion. Subsequently, a comprehensive overview of DMF-based biological analysis and applications, including nucleic acid, protein, immunoreaction and cell assays, is provided.

A more promising design strategy is to divide the microfluidic array into smaller partitions and use a small number of electrodes to control the electrodes in each partition. We propose a partitioning algorithm based on the concept of ``droplet trace'', which is extracted from the scheduling and droplet routing results produced by a synthesis tool.

Therefore, these devices must be adequately tested after manufacture and during bioassay operations. Known techniques for biochip testing are all function oblivious (i.e., while they can detect and locate defect sites on a microfluidic array, they cannot be used to ensure correct operation of functional units). In this paper, we introduce the concept of functional testing of microfluidic biochips. We address fundamental biochip operations, such as droplet dispensing, droplet transportation, mixing, splitting, and capacitive sensing. Long electrode actuation times are avoided to ensure that there is no electrode degradation during testing. The functional testing of pin-constrained biochips is also studied. We evaluate the proposed test methods using simulations as well as experiments for a fabricated biochip.},

  abstract = {The purpose of overviewing research and development status of dependable, efficient, and portable and miniaturized surface acoustic wave (SAW) is to propose practical devices for biosensing and medical diagnosis. SAW Love-mode sensors fortunately have a great deal of attention during last two decades. Several periodic structure models of SAW devices were reviewed, especially interdigital transducers (IDTs), wave guiding layers, patterned-ZnO. SAW devices based on such periodic wave guiding layers and patterned-ZnO were demonstrated with superior performance, much better than conventional SAW devices. Both 2D and 3D models of phononiccrystal-based SAW devices can be respectively fabricated by an array of periodic cylindrical holes and pillars, which allowed SAW devices to have both higher Q-factor and GHz-level frequency. Ring waveguide and spherical SAW devices would have potential applications and implementation in biosensing. ZnO is one of attractive guiding-layer materials. Its nanostructures, such as nanowires, nanorods and nanofibers provided with excellent properties, will make nanoscaled SAW devices contribute to be much more sensitive in biosensors. A range of applications based on SAW and ZnO guiding-layer would be therefore expected among of immunochemical analysis, in-situ virus or bacteria determination, microfluidic automation, and cell manipulation.},

  abstract = {Microfluidic biochips are revolutionizing high-throughput DNA sequencing, immunoassays, and clinical diagnostics. As high-throughput bioassays are mapped to digital microfluidic platforms, the need for design automation techniques is being increasingly felt. Moreover, as most applications of biochips are safety-critical in nature, defect tolerance is an essential system attribute. Several synthesis tools have recently been proposed for the automated design of biochips from the specifications of laboratory protocols. However, only a few of these tools address the problem of defect tolerance. In addition, most of these methods do not consider the problem of droplet routing in microfluidic arrays. These methods typically rely on postsynthesis droplet routing to implement biochemical protocols. Such an approach is not only time consuming, but also imposes an undue burden on the chip user. Postsynthesis droplet routing does not guarantee that feasible droplet pathways can be found for area-constrained biochip layouts; nonroutable fabricated biochips must be discarded. We present a synthesis tool that integrates defect tolerance and droplet routing in the design flow. Droplet routability, defined as the ease with which droplet pathways can be determined, is estimated and integrated in the synthesis procedure. Presynthesis and postsynthesis defect-tolerance methods are also presented. We use a large-scale protein assay as a case study to evaluate the proposed synthesis method.},

The device is based on a transparent indium tin oxide film glass as a heating element. It adopts a temperature control platform of a proportional-integral-derivative control algorithm. The system uses a charged coupled device camera, a fluorescence microscope, and an image acquisition card to form a noncontact fluorescent indicator temperature measuring device.

Among them, the sensors for biomedical applications are one of the most significant ones, which not only assist in improving the quality of human life but also help in the field of microfabrication by imparting knowledge about how to develop enhanced multifunctional sensing prototypes. The paper emphasises the use of silicon, in different forms, to fabricate electrodes and substrates for the sensors that are to be used for biomedical sensing. The electrical conductivity and the mechanical flexibility of silicon vary to a large extent depending on its use in developing prototypes. The article also explains some of the bottlenecks that need to be dealt with in the current scenario, along with some possible remedies. Finally, a brief market survey is given to estimate a probable increase in the usage of silicon in developing a variety of biomedical prototypes in the upcoming years.},

  abstract = {A variable gap size actuation (VGSA) mechanism is integrated into the digital microfluidic (DMF) system. The VGSA mechanism serves to optimize the aspect ratio during performing different microfluidic operations by changing the gap height between the top and bottom plates. This in effect will have a direct impact on the four main DMF operations including droplet transport, splitting, dispensing and merging as they are greatly affected by changing the aspect ratio. Experimental results demonstrate that the VGSA mechanism significantly enhances the principal DMF operations by retaining the appropriate gap height for each operation which is also dependent on droplets volumes when using fixed electrode size. Specifically, varying the gap height precisely between the two plates will enable us to transport the droplets more reliably, control the volume of the dispensed droplet, carry out splitting and merging more effectively, facilitate motion of residual droplets resulting from splitting or partial evaporation, enhance mixing at faster rates, achieve accurate positioning of droplets regardless of their volume, and minimize evaporation without complicating the DMF system with the use of a filler medium. The proposed mechanism is realized by accurate positioning of the top plate over the fixed bottom plate, instead of maintaining a fixed gap height during the operation. In this work, an experimental setup is constructed for the proof of concept to meet precise alignment requirements of the two parallel plates using a feedback-controlled positioning system. Three different methods viz., visual, capacitance-based and encoder values, are used to measure the gap height between the two plates precisely. For practical lab-on-chip devices, microactuators in conjunction with capacitance measurement feedback can be used to position the top plate during the operation. In this way, the proposed VGSA mechanism will introduce a mean for optimizing the parameters controlling the DMF operations.},

Laser-scribed graphene (LSG) electrodes are directly synthesized on flexible substrates to pattern the DMF electrode arrays. This facilitates the DMF electrodes' fabrication process by eliminating many microfabrication steps. An electrowetting test was performed to investigate the effectiveness of the LSG DMF electrodes in changing the contact angles of droplets. Different DMF operations were successfully performed using the proposed LSG DMF chips in both open and closed DMF systems. The quality and output resolution were examined to assess the performance of such patterned electrodes in the DMF systems. To verify the efficacy of the LSG DMF chips, a one-step direct assay for the detection of Legionella pneumophila deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was performed on the chip without the need for any washing step. The high specificity in distinguishing a single-nucleotide mismatch was achieved by detecting target DNA concentrations as low as 1 nM. Our findings suggest that the proposed rapid and easy fabrication method for LSG DMF electrodes offers a great platform for low-cost and easily accessible point-of-care diagnostic devices.},

Here we report droplet-migration characteristics on oil-infused electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) substrates. We prepare sparse micropillars to retain the oil layer in order to exploit the layer as a lubricating film. A physical model of the droplet velocity is developed, and effects of the lubrication, the oil viscosity, the droplet volume, and the thickness of solid and liquid dielectric layers are discussed. It is found that the droplet velocity is scaled as U {$\approx$} E2, which differs from a relationship of U {$\approx$} E3 for droplets sliding down on liquid-infused surfaces by gravity. Furthermore, our device achieves droplet velocity of 1 mm s-1 at the applied voltage of 15 V. The velocity is approximately tenfold as high as the same condition (applied voltage and oil viscosity) on porous-structure-based liquid-infused surfaces. The achieved high velocity is explained by a lubrication-flow effect.},

  abstract = {Single-cell analysis is developed with an aim to understand the cellular heterogeneity, including protein content, DNA, RNA, as well as the cellular metabolism. Microflow cytometry is an emerging technology to study cells at a single-cell level in a high-throughput manner and offers rich biochemical information of cells by taking advantage of microfluidic focusing. With the advancements in microfabrication technologies, microfluidics has been advanced to focus the cells from ``2D'' to ``3D'', which improves sensing capabilities of flow cytometry and brings new types of flow cytometry to the world. In this review, we first present a comprehensive review of recent developments of microfluidic technologies for 3D focusing according to the underlying physics. We then discuss the applications of microfluidic 3D focusing on advanced microflow cytometry, such as impedance flow cytometry, optical signal-based flow cytometry, imaging flow cytometry, and deformability flow cytometry. Finally, we discuss the challenges and perspectives of microfluidic 3D focusing in flow cytometry for single-cell analysis. Due to the superior capabilities of microflow cytometry employing 3D focusing, this technology will be highly promising in the near future, with further applications in biology and medicine.},

Droplet-based microfluidic cooling technologies are considered as promising solutions to conquer the major challenges of high heat flux removal and nonuniform temperature distribution in confined spaces for high performance electronic devices. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art droplet-based microfluidic cooling methods in the literature, including the basic theory of electrocapillarity, cooling applications of continuous electrowetting (CEW), electrowetting (EW) and electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD), and jumping droplet microfluidic liquid handling methods. The droplet-based microfluidic cooling methods have shown an attractive capability of microscale liquid manipulation and a relatively high heat flux removal for hot spots. Recommendations are made for further research to develop advanced liquid coolant materials and the optimization of system operation parameters.},

  abstract = {An electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) device that enhances water capturing capability for condensation applications is presented. A single planar EWOD device is fabricated for testing and placed in a high-humidity environment under mist flow. By applying an electric field to portions of the device, the wettability of the affected areas is altered from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, which promotes droplet nucleation and growth, thereby improving water capturing capability. The results of this study demonstrate that droplet coalescence is appreciably improved at the moments of plugging and unplugging DC voltage, which induces wipe-down events (when a droplet drips down the surface and removes all droplets underneath it). The improvement in water capturing capability under DC voltages of 20\,V, 40\,V, and 60\,V is also investigated both by comparing the mass of water collected on uncharged and charged devices during the same testing period and by using an image processing approach to track changes in droplet area coverage over time. The EWOD effect was shown to improve water capturing capability for the 20\,V, 40\,V, and 60\,V cases by 138.96\%, 171.87\%, and 220.43\%, respectively. These results are of great significance as they indicate a strong possibility for improvement in water harvesting applications.},

It is necessary to regularly detect microorganisms in food and environment to prevent infection of pathogenic microorganisms. However, most traditional detection methods are expensive, time-consuming, and unfeasible in practice in the absence of sophisticated instruments and trained operators. Point-of-care testing (POCT) can be used to detect microorganisms rapidly on site and greatly improve the efficiency of microbial detection. Lab-on-chip (LOC) is an emerging POCT technology with great potential by integrating most of the experimental steps carried out in the laboratory into a single monolithic device. This review will primarily focus on principles and techniques of LOC for detection of microbial nucleic acid in food and environment, including sample preparation, nucleic acid amplification and sample detection.},

In this work, the chlorine evolution potential of the Pd-Sn modified ruthenium(Ru)-iridium(Ir) electrode was investigated for the electro-catalytic treatment of high chlorine ammonia-nitrogen wastewater. The effect of reaction conditions on the removal of ammonia-nitrogen, kinetics and apparent activation energy of ammonia-nitrogen removal were studied. The possible denitrification process of high chlorine ammonia-nitrogen wastewater was discussed. The results indicated that the chlorine evolution potential of the Pd-Sn modified Ru-Ir electrode was 1.0956 V(vs. SCE). The electro-catalytic treatment of high chlorine ammonia-nitrogen conformed to zero-order kinetic law, and the apparent activation energy of removal process was 14.089 kJ/ mol. With a current was 0.5 A, the removal efficiency of ammonia-nitrogen could achieve 100\% at a reaction time of 40 min. Indirect oxidation played an essential role in the electro-catalytic ammonia-nitrogen removal using the Pd-Sn modified Ru-Ir electrode. This paper demonstrated that the electro-catalytic technology was a promising approach for efficiently treating the high chlorine ammonia-nitrogen wastewater.},

The effects of the frequency are investigated by flow visualization techniques and confirmed by numerical calculations. The results reveal that at a low frequency (1 Hz), the oscillating flows with quasistatic waves are dominant without generating net momentum, whereas at a high frequency (50 Hz), the quasisteady flows with travelling waves are dominant with the generation of net momentum capable of being used for micropropulsion.},

  abstract = {The early diagnosis of infectious diseases is critical because it can greatly increase recovery rates and prevent the spread of diseases such as COVID-19; however, in many areas with insufficient medical facilities, the timely detection of diseases is challenging. Conventional medical testing methods require specialized laboratory equipment and well-trained operators, limiting the applicability of these tests. Microfluidic point-of-care (POC) equipment can rapidly detect diseases at low cost. This technology could be used to detect diseases in underdeveloped areas to reduce the effects of disease and improve quality of life in these areas. This review details microfluidic POC equipment and its applications. First, the concept of microfluidic POC devices is discussed. We then describe applications of microfluidic POC devices for infectious diseases, cardiovascular diseases, tumors (cancer), and chronic diseases, and discuss the future incorporation of microfluidic POC devices into applications such as wearable devices and telemedicine. Finally, the review concludes by analyzing the present state of the microfluidic field, and suggestions are made. This review is intended to call attention to the status of disease treatment in underdeveloped areas and to encourage the researchers of microfluidics to develop standards for these devices.},

Principal component analysis (PCA) combined with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was employed to analyze the SERS spectra, revealing that the classification sensitivity and specificity were 90\% and 78.9\%, respectively, and the absolute value for loading of PC1 at 1509 cm               -1               was the largest. Since platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) is closely related to CHD, PDGF-BB aqueous solutions with various concentrations (1, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05 and 0.01 ppm) and a mixture of healthy human urine and PDGF-BB aqueous solutions were then investigated in this work, and it was found that the Raman peak at 1509 cm               -1               may be attributed to PDGF-BB. Moreover, the measured SERS spectra of all the urine samples from the 87 patients with CHD were compared with the clinical data provided by a hospital, and it was revealed that the appearance of a peak at 1509 cm               -1               in the SERS spectra was in good agreement with the results of coronary angiography tests when cardiovascular congestion was above 70\%. This indicated that the classification sensitivity and specificity were 87.9\% and 87.0\%, respectively, through identification of the Raman peak at 1509 cm               -1               .},

Particularly, hybrid smartphone and microfluidic devices provide an integrated solution for the new generation of mobile sensing applications. Such mobile sensing based on microfluidic devices (broadly defined) and smartphones (MS               2               ) offers a mobile laboratory for performing a wide range of bio-chemical detection and analysis functions such as water and food quality analysis, routine health tests and disease diagnosis. MS               2               offers significant advantages over traditional platforms in terms of test speed and control, low cost, mobility, ease-of-operation and data management. These improvements put MS               2               in a promising position in the fields of interdisciplinary basic and applied research. In particular, MS               2               enables applications to remote in-field testing, homecare, and healthcare in low-resource areas. The marriage of smartphones and microfluidic devices offers a powerful on-chip operating platform to enable various bio-chemical tests, remote sensing, data analysis and management in a mobile fashion. The implications of such integration are beyond telecommunication and microfluidic-related research and technology development. In this review, we will first provide the general background of microfluidic-based sensing, smartphone-based sensing, and their integration. Then, we will focus on several key application areas of MS               2               by systematically reviewing the important literature in each area. We will conclude by discussing our perspectives on the opportunities, issues and future directions of this emerging novel field.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidics is a plausible platform for manipulation of discrete droplets, which are driven by electrowetting and dielectrophoretic forces. Increasing the sustainability of DMF chips while reducing their fabrication cost would be attractive to research on droplet-based micro-actuators. Here, we report a new robust composite layer, with which a broad range of its operation voltage of DMF chips was demonstrated, covering from 30 V, which was 25 V below the theoretical value predicted with scaling model that derived from d/{$\varepsilon$}, to at least 350 V with a minimum dispensing voltage at 100 V. Also, a lifetime of at least 5000 continuous cycles at 110 volts was achieved. Deposition of such a composite layer was solely accomplished with a low-cost spincoater, instead of expensive vapour deposition instruments. And the materials we used were cheap as well. The electromechanical force, which was expressed in separate terms of electrowetting force and dielectrophoretic force on a droplet, in six chips with different values of d/{$\varepsilon$} were calculated and compared. The result from our calculation showed that, differently from lowd/{$\varepsilon$} DMF chips, there was considerable electrowetting factor among the electromechanical force in the high-d/{$\varepsilon$} DMF chips and it may be the cause that the initial apparent actuation voltage was much lower than theoretical threshold actuation voltage.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic (DMF) has emerged as one of the most popular microfluidic platforms for sample-preparation in biochemical analysis and lab-on-a-chip applications. Operated with electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) mechanism, DMF conventionally requires an external power source to provide the actuation voltage, which limited its portability and broader applications in point-of-care testing (POCT) environment. Herein, a DMF device, self-powered by triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is presented. TENG possesses a number of unique characteristics, and is very attractive to be integrated with DMF. It only requires a simple configuration with lowcost fabrication that can improve the DMF portability, but it also provides high voltage, low current output characteristics that are consistent with the EWOD actuation requirements. Basic droplet manipulations, including transportation, split, merge, dispense, and even elongate to follow the electrode patterns of alphabets, on a DMF device powered with manually-rotated Disk-TENG are demonstrated for the first time. Further, droplets containing samples and reagents are transported and mixed on the programmed electrode patterns on the chip to conduct chemical reactions, including nucleic acid amplification and phenol red test, showing that Disk-TENG can serve as the power source for DMF chips in POCT applications.},

  abstract = {Microarray technology has attracted increasing attentions in the field of bioanalysis due to its advantages of high throughput and low sample and reagent consumptions. In this study, we developed a slipchip-based microfluidic system, in which sample and reagent could form two separate concentration gradients orthogonally. After sliding, samples and reagents of various concentrations could be mixed for multiplexed reactions. The performance of the developed microfluidic system was validated with food dyes and fluorescein. The reaction conditions involving {$\beta$}-galactosidase ({$\beta$}-gal) was investigated with the developed method. The solutions of 45 nM {$\beta$}-gal and 45 {$\mu$}M FDG (Fluorescein di-{$\beta$}-D-galactoside) were injected into the upper layer and lower layer of the slipchip respectively. After the formation of two concentration gradients, one-step sliding of the upper layer enabled mixing and reacting of the enzyme and the substrate with different concentrations. As a result, the amount of the reaction products increased with the increasing concentrations of substrate. At a given concentration of substrate, the amount of products rapidly reached a plateau with the increasing concentrations of enzyme. These results were consistent with those obtained using 384-well plate. This method was simple in operation with low consumption of sample and reagent, allowing rapid establishment of two orthogonal concentration gradients for multiplexed reactions.},

Voltammetry has classically been treated with the Randles-Sevcik equation, which assumes an electroneutral supported electrolyte. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive mathematical theory of voltammetry in electrochemical cells with unsupported electrolytes and for other situations where diffuse charge effects play a role, and present analytical and simulated solutions of the time-dependent Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations with generalized Frumkin-Butler-Volmer (FBV) boundary conditions for a 1:1 electrolyte and a simple reaction. Using these solutions, we construct theoretical and simulated currentvoltage curves for liquid and solid thin films, membranes with fixed background charge, and cells with blocking electrodes. The full range of dimensionless parameters is considered, including the dimensionless Debye screening length (scaled to the electrode separation), Damkohler number (ratio of characteristic diffusion and reaction times) and dimensionless sweep rate (scaled to the thermal voltage per diffusion time). The analysis focuses on the coupling of Faradaic reactions and diffuse charge dynamics, although capacitive charging of the electrical double layers (EDL) is also studied, for early time transients at reactive electrodes and for non-reactive blocking electrodes. Our work highlights cases where diffuse charge effects are important in the context of voltammetry, and illustrates which regimes can be approximated using simple analytical expressions and which require more careful consideration.},

Digital counting of single bacteria at the membrane surface under nanoconfinement could be achieved. The idLAMP successfully accomplished the quantitative detection of Escherichia coli in 100 mL water samples within 30 min, with wide dynamic range from 0.09 to 900 cells/mL. This technique could also be well applied to the quantification of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi in real beverage samples (juice, tea drinks, carbonated drinks and alcoholic drinks) without tedious sample pretreatments. With facile operation, higher specificity and sensitivity and better end-point analysis capabilities, the system has great potential in quantitative counting of single bacteria in large-volume food samples.},

In digital microfluidic biochips, cross-contamination of droplets with different biomolecules is a major issue, which causes significant errors in bioassays. Washing operations are introduced to clean the cross-contamination spots. However, existing works have oversimplified assumptions on the washing behavior, which either assume infinite washing capacity, or ignore the routing conflicts between functional and washing droplets. This paper proposes the first integrated functional and washing droplet routing flow, which considers practical issues including the finite washing capacity constraint, and the routing conflicts between functional and washing droplets. Washing droplets of different sizes are also proposed to wash the congested cross-contamination spots. Effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by real-life biochemical applications.},

An integrated digital microfluidic zoom actuating unit with a logic addressing unit for a built-in membrane lens array, e.g., a flexible bionic compound eye, is developed and studied in this article. A concave--convex membrane fluidic microvalve, which is the component element of the logic gate, actuator, and microlens, is proposed to replace the traditional solenoid valve. The functions of pressure regulation and decoding can be obtained by incorporating microvalves into fluidic networks according to equivalent circuit designs. The zoom actuating unit contains a pressure regulator to adjust the focal length of lenses with three levels, and the logic addressing unit contains a decoder to choose a typical lens from a hexagonal lens array. The microfluidic chip control system is connected flexibly to the actuating part, a membrane lens array. It is shown from a simulation and experimental demonstration that the designed and fabricated system, which is composed of a whole microfluidic zoom unit, addressing technology, and a microlens array, works well. Because these components are constructed in the same fabrication process and operate with the same work media and driving source, the system can be made highly compatible and lightweight for applications such as human-machine interfaces and soft robots.},

Both magnetic HRP-bacteria and unbound MNPs were magnetically separated from background and resuspended in viscoelastic polyvinylpyrrolidone solution as sample flow. When sample flow was injected with polyvinylpyrrolidone sheath flow into a T-shaped microchannel, larger-sized magnetic HRP-bacteria could penetrate the sample flow, however smaller-sized MNPs remained in the sample flow due to weaker inertial lift force and elastic lift force, resulting in continuous-flow separation of magnetic HRP-bacteria. Finally, magnetic HRP-bacteria were collected and concentrated to catalyze tetramethyl benzidine, and absorbance was measured to determine the bacteria. This biosensor was able to detect Salmonella as low as 30 CFU/mL in 1 h and featured the advantages of shorter time due to a one-step immunoreaction, easier extension due to only one antibody and one label, and lower cost due to less expensive materials.},

Water contamination can be accidental or intentional and the consequences are drastic unless the appropriate measures are adopted on the spot. This review provides a critical assessment of the applicability of various technologies for real-time water quality monitoring, focusing on those that have been reportedly tested in real-life scenarios. Specifically, the performance of sensors based on molecularly imprinted polymers is evaluated in detail, also giving insights into their principle of operation, stability in real on-site applications and mass production options. Such characteristics as sensing range and limit of detection are given for the most promising systems, that were verified outside of laboratory conditions. Then, novel trends of using microwave spectroscopy and chemical materials integration for achieving a higher sensitivity to and selectivity of pollutants in water are described.},

This technique can be achieved by applying a voltage to only two interdigitated and wedge-shaped electrodes: one coated with and the other without a dielectric SiO2 film. Several experimental results showed that a decrease in SiO2 thickness reduces the minimum required voltage, and that an application of square-wave voltage permits lower voltage transportation of a droplet than that of DC voltage. Also, droplet velocity depended on frequency of an applied square-wave voltage, and the velocity of a 15 {$\mu$}l deionized (DI) water droplet reached the maximum at 60 Hz.},

The surface modified device allowed controllable autonomous capillary flow delivery with a contact angle of around 40{$^\circ$} stabilised for at least 90~days. The design of two inlets with one common long snake-shaped microchannel provided the sequential capillary flow generation and propagation with controlled flow rate and propagation distance, while the micropillar array with a high aspect ratio of 5 was considered as an effective capillary pump.

  abstract = {Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) chips have become the most promising technology to realize pin-constrained digital microfluidic biochips (PDMFBs). In the design flow of EWOD chips, reliability is a critical challenge as it directly affects execution of bioassays. The major factor to degrade chip reliability is the trapped charge problem, which is induced by excessive applied voltage. Nevertheless, to comply with the pin constraint for PDMFBs, signal merging is inevitably involved, and thereby incurring trapped charges due to unawareness of applied voltage. Except for the trapped charge problem, wire routing to accomplish electrical connections increases the design complexity of pin-constrained EWOD chips. Unfortunately, no existing works tackle the problems of excessive applied voltage and wire routing, and thus the resultant chip will have more probabilities to fail during execution or can not be realized because of wire routing problem. In this paper, we present a network-flow based algorithm for reliabilitydriven pin-constrained EWOD chips with the consideration of voltage issue. Our algorithm not only minimizes the reliability problem induced by signal merging but also provides a comprehensive routing solution for EWOD chiplevel designs. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed algorithm on real-life chips.},

These waves are responsible for a diverse range of complex fluid transport phenomena---from interfacial fluid vibration and drop and confined fluid transport to jetting and atomization---underlying a flourishing research literature spanning fundamental fluid physics to chip-scale engineering applications.

  abstract = {The present research investigated the voltage polarity asymmetry phenomenon based on dielectric wetting. In an ITO--hydrophobic layer--droplet setup, three reagents with different pH values (3.96, 7.0, and 10.18), two types of hydrophobic materials (AF1601 and 6\%T6), and two different thicknesses (340 nm and 2.5 {\textmu}m) of each material were systematically investigated. The results show that the thickness of the hydrophobic dielectric layer and the pH of the droplets had a significant impact on the droplet contact angle variation with the voltage. The contact angle on the thick hydrophobic dielectric layer followed the Lippmann--Young equation as the voltage changed. The angle of the thin hydrophobic dielectric layer was affected by its own properties and the type of droplet, which led to the occurrence of voltage polarity asymmetry of the electrowetting phenomenon. After further investigation of this phenomenon, it was found that it mainly accounted for the decrease in electric field strength at both ends of the droplet, which was caused by electrochemical reactions and changes in circuit resistance. The leakage current is an important indicator, and this phenomenon can be prevented by increasing the thickness of the hydrophobic dielectric layer.},

Front-end operations such as sample preparation play a pivotal role in biochemical laboratories, and in applications in biomedical engineering and life science. For fast and high-throughput biochemical applications, preparing samples of multiple target concentrations sequentially is inefficient and time-consuming. Therefore, it is critical to concurrently prepare samples of multiple target concentrations. In addition, since reagents used in biochemical reactions are expensive, reagent-saving has become an important consideration in sample preparation. Prior work in this area does not address the problem of reagentsaving and concurrent sample preparation for multiple target concentrations. In this paper, we propose the first reagent-saving mixing algorithm for biochemical samples of multiple target concentrations. The proposed algorithm not only minimizes the consumption of reagents, but it also reduces the number of waste droplets and the sample preparation time by preparing the target concentrations concurrently. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on both real biochemical experiments and synthetic test cases to demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency. Compared to prior work, the proposed algorithm can achieve up to 41\% reduction in the number of reagent droplets and waste droplets, and up to 50\% reduction in sample preparation time.},

However, current methods with a single ultrasonic transducer offer limited control of the position of single particles. In this paper, we demonstrate closed-loop two-dimensional manipulation of particles inside closed-channel microfluidic chips, by controlling the frequency of a single ultrasound transducer, based on machine-vision-measured positions of the particles. For the control task, we propose using algorithms derived from the family of multi-armed bandit algorithms. We show that these algorithms can achieve controlled manipulation with no prior information on the acoustic field shapes. The method learns as it goes: there is no need to restart the experiment at any point. Starting with no knowledge of the field shapes, the algorithms can (eventually) move a particle from one position inside the chamber to another. This makes the method very robust to changes in chip and particle properties. We demonstrate that the method can be used to manipulate a single particle, three particles simultaneously, and also a single particle in the presence of a bubble in the chip. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applications of this method in active sorting of particles, by guiding each particle to exit the chip through one of three different outlets at will. Because the method requires no model or calibration, the work paves the way toward the acoustic manipulation of microparticles inside unstructured environments.},

Programmable microfluidic chips try to overcome this by offering reconfigurable functionalities, allowing the same chip to be used in multiple different applications.

The algorithm has no prior knowledge of the acoustic fields but learns to control the droplets on the fly. The manipulation is based on switching the frequency of a single ultrasonic transducer. Using this method, we demonstrate 2D transportation and merging of water droplets in oil and oil droplets in water, and we performed the chemistry that underlies the basis of a colorimetric glucose assay. We show that we can manipulate drops with volumes ranging from {$\sim$}200 pL up to {$\sim$}30 nL with our setup. We also demonstrate that our method is robust, by changing the system parameters and showing that the machine learning algorithm can still complete the manipulation tasks. In short, our method uses ultrasonics to flexibly manipulate droplets, enabling programmable droplet microfluidic devices.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the open electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) device has been widely used in biomedical detection, chemical synthesis analysis, and so on. However, the cost of using ITO glass as surface material is difficult to meet the requirement for large-scale array chip production. So, a low-cost, easy-to-manufacture open EWOD platform is designed in this paper. In hardware platform, an operation platform is prepared by using a printed circuit board (PCB) as a substrate. The electrode shape is designed as zigzag, and its surface is optimized by organic solderability preservatives (OSP). In addition, Parafilm M and silicone oil are used as a dielectric hydrophobic layer to prepare the open platform. In software, the system program is designed by C programming language, including initialization program, serial port communication program, high-voltage output port program, and interrupt program, which can be used to drive droplets. The system can achieve an effective driving voltage of 180--240 V. The moving speed of droplets can reach 15 mm/s when the droplet volume is 1850 {\textmu}L and the electrode voltage output frequency is 10 Hz.},

The intelligent ammonia sensor integrates ammonia electrode, pH electrode and Ammonia Ion electrode together to realize the in situ detection of ammonia. The test results have shown that the sensor is easy operation, low cost and no pollution. The ammonia is determined potentiometrically using an ammonia ion selective electrode and a pH/mV meter, having an expanded millivolt scale. The ammonia selective electrode uses a hydrophobic gas-permeable membrane to separate the sample solution from an electrode internal solution of ammonium chloride. Dissolved ammonia is converted to NH3 gas by raising the pH to above 11.0 with a strong base. NH3 gas diffuses the membrane and changes the internal solution pH that is sensed by the electrode. In single laboratory test results have been found 1.001 NH3-/L and 0.897 mg NH3-N/L, recoveries were 77.3\% and 83.1\%, respectively.},

The detection of SARS-CoV-2 and human enteric pathogens in wastewater can provide an early warning of disease outbreak. Herein, a sensitive, multiplexed, colorimetric detection (termed ``SMCD'') method was established for pathogen detection in wastewater samples. The SMCD method integrated on-chip nucleic acid extraction, two-stage isothermal amplification, and colorimetric detection on a 3D printed microfluidic chip. The colorimetric signal during nucleic acid amplification was recorded in real-time and analyzed by a programmed smartphone without the need for complicated equipment. By combining two-stage isothermal amplification assay into the integrated microfluidic platform, we detected SARS-CoV-2 and human enteric pathogens with sensitivities of 100 genome equivalent (GE)/mL and 500 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL, respectively, in wastewater within one hour. Additionally, we realized smart, connected, on-site detection with a reporting framework embedded in a portable detection platform, which exhibited potential for rapid spatiotemporal epidemiologic data collection regarding the environmental dynamics, transmission, and persistence of infectious diseases.},

However, the quantification of current methods is performed using standard curves and external references, and not direct and absolute quantification. This paper describes an integrated multiplex digital recombinase polymerase amplification (ImdRPA) microfluidic chip which combines DNA extraction, multiplex digital RPA and fluorescence detection together in one chip, creating a ``sample-in-multiplex-digital-answer-out'' system. Multi-layer soft lithography technology was used, with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as the chip material and a glass slide as the substrate. This microfluidic chip has a six-layer structure and screw microvalve control function. The sample preparation for the chip involved magnetic bead-based nucleic acid extraction, which was completed within 15 min without any instrument dependence. The dRPA region was divided into 4 regions (3 positive detection areas and 1 negative control area) and included a total of 12\,800 chambers, with each chamber being able to contain a volume of 2.7 nL. The screw valve allowed for the reaction components of each specific goal to be pre-embedded in different regions of the chambers. The reagents were passively driven into the dRPA region using vacuum-based self-priming introduction. Furthermore, we successfully demonstrated that the chip can simultaneously detect three species of pathogenic bacteria within 45 min and give digital quantitative results without the need to establish a standard curve in contaminated milk. Moreover, the detection limit of this ImdRPA microfluidic chip was found to be 10 bacterial cells for each kind of pathogen. These characteristics enhance its applicability for rapid detection of foodborne bacteria at the point-of-care (POC). We envision that the further development of this integrated chip will lead to rapid, multiplex and accurate detection of foodborne bacteria in a feasible manner.},

In each case, a transverse electric field is used to create an electrostatic pressure, giving rise to the transport of individual liquid slugs. This paper examines the nature of the force distribution for both EWOD and DEP actuated droplets. The effects of system parameters such as contact angle and electrode length on the shape of the force density and its net integral are considered. A comparison of the scaling properties of DEP and EWOD for applications in digital microfluidics is presented. The net DEP force is shown to be strongly peaked when a droplet interface is located near the edge of a charged electrode and reduces to the well-known lumped parameter model in the appropriate limits. The effect of electrode spacing is seen to have an inversely proportional effect on the force experienced by the droplet, and the effect of increasing droplet contact angle is observed to increase the net force on the droplet.},

Anthropogenic activities have highly impacted the natural balance of the nitrogen species. Therefore, it is critical to monitor nitrogen concentrations in different environments continuously. Various methods have been explored to measure the concentration of nitrogen species in the air, soil, and water. Here, we review the recent advancements in optical and electrochemical sensing methods for measuring nitrogen concentration in the air, soil, and water.

This paper deals with controlling the capillary forces, specifically, acting on objects floating on a dielectric (nonconductive) fluid. A key control input parameter is the wettability (contact angle) of the sidewall adjacent to the floating object. By introducing dielectrowetting to the sidewall and actively changing the contact angle on the sidewall, the capillary force is controlled and easily reversed between attraction and repulsion. In this reversing process, the tilting angle of the sidewall is another critical parameter. A theoretical relation taking the titling angle into account is compared and in good agreement with experimental results obtained from the trajectory of the floating object. Finally, a continuous motion of the floating object is demonstrated using this control where an array of dielectrowetting electrode pads is sequentially activated.},

The oscillation of the free surface generates a propelling force on the centimeter-sized floating object. This paper describes a propulsion mechanism in free-surface oscillation along with its experimental results. Flow visualizations, wave patterns measured by the free-surface synthetic schlieren method, and PIV measurements show that the oscillation generates a capillary Stokes drift on the water surface and two counter-rotating spiral underwater vortices, leading to an ejecting flow (streaming flow) normal to the wall of the boat. The momentum of the ejecting flow produces a reaction force on the wall and ultimately propels the floating boat. The propulsion speed of the boat highly depends on the amplitude, frequency, and shape of the AC EWOD signal. Curve fittings based on the Stokes drift well match the experimental measurements of propulsion speed. The width of the EWOD electrode also has significant effects on the boat speed.},

We developed an equivalent circuit for this microfluidic device by using the method of lumped parameter electromechanics. The voltage distributions across the device dielectric layer and the droplet were calculated based on the model. The actuation force for the parallel-plate device was derived according to the principle of virtual work. Based on the force calculation, we studied the effects of droplet conductivity, dielectric constant, and the electric field frequencies on the electrical force exerted on the liquid droplet.},

Proton-exchanged Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 (H-ZSM-5) with SiO2/Al2O3 ratios of 23, 80 and 280 were electrochemically synthesized with polypyrrole (PPy). The anionic groups on the zeolite framework functioned as the counter ions for PPy during the reaction. H-ZSM-5 particles were observed on the surface as well as inside the composite films. PPy/H-ZSM-5 composites gave a similar cyclic voltammogram as PPy doped with chloride, PPy(Cl ). The hydrophobicity of the composites decreased in the order PPy/H-ZSM-5--23 {$>$} PPy/H-ZSM-5--80 {$>$} PPy/H-ZSM-5-280. The redox capacitance of the composite was better utilized than that of PPy(Cl ) after they were coated with a plasticized PVC membrane. PPy/H-ZSM-5 composite-based K+-ISEs exhibited similar potential stability as the PPy(Cl )based K+-ISE. However, when compared with the PPy(Cl )-based K+-ISE, the detection limit of PPy/HZSM-5 composite-based K+-ISEs was enhanced after a long-term conditioning.},

  abstract = {Due to recent advances in microfluidics, digital microfluidic biochips are expected to revolutionize laboratory procedures. One critical problem for biochip synthesis is the droplet routing problem. Unlike traditional very large scale integration routing problems, in addition to routing path selection, the biochip routing problem needs to address the issue of scheduling droplets under practical constraints imposed by the fluidic property and timing restriction of synthesis results. In this paper, we present the first network-flow-based routing algorithm that can concurrently route a set of noninterfering nets for the droplet routing problem on biochips. We adopt a two-stage technique of global routing followed by detailed routing. In global routing, we first identify a set of noninterfering nets and then adopt the network-flow approach to generate optimal global-routing paths for nets. In detailed routing, we present the first polynomial-time algorithm for simultaneous routing and scheduling using the global-routing paths with a negotiation-based routing scheme. Our algorithm targets at both the minimization of cells used for routing for better fault tolerance and minimization of droplet transportation time for better reliability and faster bioassay execution. Experimental results show the robustness and efficiency of our algorithm.},

The optimized process focused on the surface modification of Teflon, selective exposure for the electrochemical module and recovery of surface properties by one-step annealing at low temperature. The optimum modification time and annealing temperature were 20 s and 210 {\textopenbullet}C, respectively. The experimental results from atomic force microscope and contact angle (CA) measurement revealed the effects of surface roughness and apparent CA on the wettability for different etch times. The multifunctionality of droplet creation, merger and transportation in the EWOD microfluidic module and sensitive electrochemical detection for the redox probe were realized simultaneously. The proposed microfabrication process has many advantages of remarkable simplicity, prominent repeatability, low cost and compatibility with standard IC processes. It shows great promise for the microsystem of the microfluidic unit and detecting cell, and gives a brilliant conception for the future fabrication of monolithic LOC integrated with functional detection.},

In this work, we made full use of the parallel-plate structure of the EWOD digital microfluidic device to fabricate the microfluidic module on the bottom plate and the three-microelectrode-system-integrated electrochemical cell together with patterned ground electrode on the top plate. The proposed LOC possesses the multifunction of: (1) creating, merging and transporting of microliter-level sample droplets, (2) online biosensing, and (3) droplets recycling. The three-electrodeintegrated microsensor not only reveals a sensitive electrochemical detection for FcM in a wide concentration range (10 {$\mu$}M--1.0 mM), but also shows good stability, selectivity and reproducibility for surface-controlled detection of DA. The calibration of DA was linear for concentration from 1.0 to 50.0 {$\mu$}M with a high sensitivity of 2145 nA {$\mu$}M-1 cm-2 (R2 = 0.9933) and estimated detection limit of 0.42 {$\mu$}M (signal/noise ratio of 3).

Current purification methods of centrifugation, column chromatography and continuous-flow techniques suffer from particle aggregation, multi-stage process, complex setups and necessary nanofabrication. These increase process costs and time, reduce efficiency and limit dynamic range. Here, we achieve an unprecedented real-time nanoparticle separation (51--1500 nm) using a large-pore (2 {$\mu$}m) deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) device. No external force fields or nanofabrication are required. Instead, we investigated innate long-range electrostatic influences on nanoparticles within a fluid medium at different NaCl ionic concentrations. In this study we account for the electrostatic forces beyond Debye length and showed that they cannot be assumed as negligible especially for precise nanoparticle separation methods such as DLD. Our findings have enabled us to develop a model to simultaneously quantify and modulate the electrostatic force interactions between nanoparticle and micropore. By simply controlling buffer solutions, we achieve dynamic nanoparticle size separation on a single device with a rapid response time ({$<$}20 s) and an enlarged dynamic range ({$>$}1200\%), outperforming standard benchtop centrifuge systems. This novel method and model combines device simplicity, isolation precision and dynamic flexibility, opening opportunities for high-throughput applications in nano-separation for industrial and biological applications.},

However, few fluidic mechanisms allow for basic logic operations on rewritable fluidic paths due to cross-contamination, which leads to random interference between ``fluidic bits'' or droplets. Here, we introduce a mechanism that allows for contact-free gating of individual droplets based on the scalable features of acoustic streaming vortices (ASVs). By shifting the hydrodynamic equilibrium positions inside interconnected ASVs with multitonal electrical signals, different functions such as controlling the routing and gating of droplets on rewritable fluidic paths are demonstrated with minimal biochemical cross-contamination. Electrical control of this ASV-based mechanism allows for unidirectional routing and active gating behaviors, which can potentially be scaled to functional fluidic processors that can regulate the flow of droplets in a manner similar to the current in transistor arrays.},

Point-of-care (POC) testing platforms can offer accurate screening in a timely manner, making these tools ideal under these circumstances. Digital microfluidics (DMF) is a fluid handling technology that enables programmable manipulation of discrete droplets (picoliter to microliter range) on a planar surface featured with electrodes, by changing the surface tension of droplets using electric fields. This technology allows user-defined droplet manipulation such as dispensing, mixing, splitting and merging, and thus the platform can be reconfigured for various assays. Although efforts have been undertaken to optimize the accuracy of fluid handling in DMF devices, implementing these devices for POC testing requires the integration of various detection techniques for on-chip assays. In this review, we highlight recent advancements in the integration of analytical tools into DMF devices, and discuss the current challenges and potential solutions as well as future outlooks for an automated, integrative platform for POC applications.},

Compared to the conventional methods, ion-selective electrode (ISE) shows advantages on its rapid response, inexpensive cost and simple operation. In this study, two kinds of novel solid-state ISEs (S-ISEs) were manufactured and evaluated. In standard solution measurement, quasi-ideal Nernstian performances were observed on both of the monolayer and bilayer S-ISEs. Besides, S-ISEs demonstrated the faster response time of less than 30 s, which was 60\% time reduction of the conventional PVC polymeric ISE (PVC-ISE). The bilayer S-ISE illustrated more stable potential responses than the monolayer SISE in the continuous 500 s detection. In soil extract measurement, the nitrate bilayer S-ISE provided the smallest absolute error(AE) of 6.8 mg L 1 among the tested three ISEs. The potassium bilayer S-ISE generated the similar testing ability as the monolayer S-ISE and PVC-ISE. In soil slurry measurement, obvious disturbance was placed on all of the tested ISEs. Thus, the filtration was an necessary operation of soil pretreatment for the ISE-based soil detection. More soil samples of a broader geographical area should be tested for the validation of the applicability of S-ISEs.},

Most advanced fluidic handling technologies (e.g., microfluidic chips and micro-well plates) lack fluid rewritability, and the associated benefits of multi-path routing and re-programmability, due to surface-adsorption-induced contamination on contacting structures. This limits their processing speed and the complexity of reaction test matrices. We present a contactless droplet transport and processing technique called digital acoustofluidics which dynamically manipulates droplets with volumes from 1\,nL to 100\,{\textmu}L along any planar axis via acoustic-streaming-induced hydrodynamic traps, all in a contamination-free (lower than 10               -10               \% diffusion into the fluorinated carrier oil layer) and biocompatible (99.2\% cell viability) manner.

For instance, the human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), as a major player in the immune system, is an important index to indicate a patient's immune function. Therefore, establishing a simple yet sensitive tool that can frequently assess the immune system during the course of disease and treatment is of great importance. This study introduced an integrated system that includes an electrochemical impedance spectroscope (EIS)-based biosensor in a digital microfluidic (DMF) device, to quantify the PBMC abundance with minimally trained hands. Moreover, we exploited the unique droplet manipulation feature of the DMF platform and conducted a dynamic cell capture assay, which enhanced the detection signal by 2.4-fold. This integrated system was able to detect as few as 104 PBMCs per mL, presenting suitable sensitivity to quantify PBMCs. This integrated system is easy-to-operate and sensitive, and therefore holds great potential as a powerful tool to profile immune-mediated therapeutic responses in a timely manner, which can be further evolved as a point-of-care diagnostic device to conduct near-patient tests from blood samples.},

  abstract = {PD1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors are at the forefront of cancer immunotherapies. However, the overall response rate remains only 10--30\%. Even among initial responders, drug resistance often occurs, which can lead to prolonged use of a futile therapy in the race with the fatal disease. It would be ideal to closely monitor key indicators of patients' immune responsiveness, such as circulating PD-L1 levels. Traditional PD-L1 detection methods, such as ELISA, are limited in sensitivity and rely on core lab facilities, preventing their use for the regular monitoring. Electrochemical sensors exist as an attractive candidate for point-of-care tool, yet, streamlining multiple processes in a single platform remains a challenge. To overcome this challenge, this work integrated electrochemical sensor arrays into a digital microfluidic device to combine their distinct merits, so that soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) molecules can be rapidly detected in a programmed and automated manner. This new platform featured microscale electrochemical sensor arrays modified with electrically conductive 3D matrix, and can detect as low as 1 pg/mL sPD-L1 with high specificity. The sensors also have desired repeatability and can obtain reproducible results on different days. To demonstrate the functionality of the device to process more complex biofluids, we used the device to detect sPD-L1 molecules secreted by human breast cancer cell line in culture media directly and observed 2X increase in signal compared with control experiment. This novel platform holds promise for the close monitoring of sPD-L1 level in human physiological fluids to evaluate the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy.},

In this study, we report an automated magnetic digital microfluidics-based platform, known as DropCarba, for parallel CPGNB detection in droplets. It automates the entire carbapenemase testing process and eliminates the need for almost all hands-on fluidic operations, which ensures high consistency and minimizes human errors with a simple ``press-and-go'' operation. DropCarba was validated with a large number of bacterial isolates of various Enterobacterales species (200 strains in total with 100 CPGNB and 100 non-resistant strains) in a blinded manner, and the results agree well with the benchmark Carba NP. DropCarba, with its full automation, simple operation, reduced reagent consumption, parallelization processing, and scalable manufacturing, will greatly improve CPGNB screening and make a valuable contribution to our fight against antibiotic resistance.},

These colors are classified as three carcinogens and are linked to liver and bladder cancers. They are not authorized for human consumption by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and are not permitted to be used by the Food Standards Agency or the European Union. This article describes electrochemical dye analysis beside the numerous electrochemical sensors utilized to identify these dyes as a food colorant and water. As a result, the qualities, chemistry, and toxicity of dyes as food colorants and industrial goods in Sudan have been investigated in this study. Sudan dyes have been thoroughly studied, and many electrochemical sensors have been developed to define and monitor these dyes in food colorants. As a result, current electrochemical sensors have been found to be neither mass-production nor cost-effective. Mostly, the synthesis of high-performance materials needs high knowledge, and the production of electrode surfaces is remained difficult due to labor-intensive and timeconsuming activities.},

Electrochemical experiments demonstrated that the Pt-Ag/PPy-NiF electrode showed a great electrocatalytic ability of the oxidation of ammonia and an electrochemical aqueous ammonia sensor was proposed accordingly. The ammonia sensor showed a sensitivity of 0.089 mA {$\mu$}M-1, a detection limit of 37 nM (S/N = 3) and a wide linear range, as well as presenting a good anti-interference capability against many common ions in water. These excellent performances can be mainly attributed to large specific surface of electrode and great electrocatalytic ability of Pt nanoparticles.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, inertial microfluidics has attracted significant attention and a wide variety of channel designs that focus, concentrate and separate particles and fluids have been demonstrated. In contrast to conventional microfluidic technologies, where fluid inertia is negligible and flow remains almost within Stokes flow region with very low Reynolds number Re {$<<$}1, inertial microfluidics works in the intermediate Reynolds number range ({\textasciitilde}1 {$<$} Re {$<$} {\textasciitilde}100) between Stokes and turbulent regimes. In this intermediate range, both inertia and fluid viscosity are finite, and bring about several intriguing effects that form the basis of inertial microfluidics including: (i) inertial migration and (ii) secondary flow. Due to the superior features of high-throughput, simplicity, precise manipulation and low cost, inertial microfluidics is a very promising candidate for cellular sample processing, especially for sample with low abundant targets. In this review, we first discuss the fundamental kinematics of particles in microchannels to familiarise readers with mechanisms and underlying physics in inertial microfluidic systems. We then present a comprehensive review of recent developments and key applications of inertial microfluidic systems according to their microchannel structures. Finally, we discuss the perspective of employing fluid inertia in microfluidics for particle manipulation. Due to the superior benefits of inertial microfluidics, this promising technology will still be an attractive topic in the near future, with more novel designs and further applications in biology, medicine and industry on the horizon.},

We will present some complex microfluidic devices showing that the analogy is going a long way off toward more complex components with impressive similarities between electronics and microfluidics.

In addition, due to the existence of inevitable human invention, the inconsistent judgment standards make the comparison between different experiments cumbersome and almost impossible. In this paper, we tried to use machine learning to build algorithms that could automatically identify, judge, and predict flow patterns and droplet characteristics, so that the empirical judgment was transferred to be an intelligent process. The difference on the usual machine learning algorithms, a generalized variable system was introduced to describe the different geometry configurations of the digital microfluidics. Specifically, Buckingham's theorem had been adopted to obtain multiple groups of dimensionless numbers as the input variables of machine learning algorithms. Through the verification of the algorithms, the SVM and BPNN algorithms had classified and predicted the different flow patterns and droplet characteristics (the length and frequency) successfully. By comparing with the primitive parameters system, the dimensionless numbers system was superior in the predictive capability. The traditional dimensionless numbers selected for the machine learning algorithms should have physical meanings strongly rather than mathematical meanings. The machine learning algorithms applying the dimensionless numbers had declined the dimensionality of the system and the amount of computation and not lose the information of primitive parameters.},

  abstract = {A magnetic digital microfluidic platform manipulates droplets on an open surface.           ,              A digital microfluidic platform manipulates droplets on an open surface. Magnetic digital microfluidics utilizes magnetic forces for actuation and offers unique advantages compared to other digital microfluidic platforms. First, the magnetic particles used in magnetic digital microfluidics have multiple functions. In addition to serving as actuators, they also provide a functional solid substrate for molecule binding, which enables a wide range of applications in molecular diagnostics and immunodiagnostics. Second, magnetic digital microfluidics can be manually operated in a ``power-free'' manner, which allows for operation in low-resource environments for point-of-care diagnostics where even batteries are considered a luxury item. This review covers research areas related to magnetic digital microfluidics. This paper first summarizes the current development of magnetic digital microfluidics. Various methods of droplet manipulation using magnetic forces are discussed, ranging from conventional magnetic particle-based actuation to the recent development of ferrofluids and magnetic liquid marbles. This paper also discusses several new approaches that use magnetically controlled flexible substrates for droplet manipulation. In addition, we emphasize applications of magnetic digital microfluidics in biosensing and medical diagnostics, and identify the current limitations of magnetic digital microfluidics. We provide a perspective on possible solutions to close these gaps. Finally, the paper discusses the future improvement of magnetic digital microfluidics to explore potential new research directions.},

  abstract = {As more micro- and nanofluidic methodologies are developed for a growing number of diverse applications, it becomes increasingly apparent that the choice of substrate material can have a profound effect on the eventual performance of a device. This is due mostly to the high surface-to-volume ratio that exists within such small structures. In addition to the obvious limitations related to the choice of solvent, operating temperatures, and pressure, the method of fluidic pumping---in particular, an electrokinetics-based methodology using a combination of electro-osmotic and electrophoresis flows---can further complicate material choice. These factors, however, are only part of the problem; once chemicals or biological materials (e.g., proteins or cells) are introduced into a microfluidic system, surface characteristics will have a profound influence on the activity of such components, which will subsequently influence their performance. This article reviews the common types of materials that are currently used to fabricate microfluidic devices and considers how these materials may influence the overall performance associated with chemical and biological processing.},

First, the types of microvalves in PCR chips are discussed, including active and passive microvalves. The active microvalves are subdivided into mechanical (thermopneumatic and shape memory alloy), non-mechanical (hydrogel, sol--gel, paraffin, and ice), and external (modular built-in, pneumatic, and non-pneumatic) microvalves. The passive microvalves also include mechanical (in-line polymerized gel and passive plug) and non-mechanical (hydrophobic) microvalves. The review then discusses mechanical (piezoelectric, pneumatic, and thermopneumatic) and non-mechanical (electrokinetic, magnetohydrodynamic, electrochemical, acoustic-wave, surface tension and capillary, and ferrofluidic magnetic) micropumps in PCR chips. Next, different micromixers within PCR chips are presented, including passive (Y/T-type flow, recirculation flow, and drop) and active (electrokinetically-driven, acoustically-driven, magnetohydrodynamical-driven, microvalves/pumps) micromixers. Finally, general discussions on microvalves, micropumps, and micromixers for PCR chips are given.

  abstract = {Most of the current analytical methods depend largely on laboratory-based analytical techniques that require expensive and bulky equipment, potentially incur costly testing, and involve lengthy detection processes. With increasing requirements for point-of-care testing (POCT), more attention has been paid to miniaturized analytical devices. Miniaturized electrochemical (MEC) sensors, including different material-based MEC sensors (such as DNA-, paper-, and screen electrode-based), have been in strong demand in analytical science due to their easy operation, portability, high sensitivity, as well as their short analysis time. They have been applied for the detection of trace amounts of target through measuring changes in electrochemical signal, such as current, voltage, potential, or impedance, due to the oxidation/reduction of chemical/biological molecules with the help of electrodes and electrochemical units. MEC sensors present great potential for the detection of targets including small organic molecules, metal ions, and biomolecules. In recent years, MEC sensors have been broadly applied to POCT in various fields, including health care, food safety, and environmental monitoring, owing to the excellent advantages of electrochemical (EC) technologies. This review summarized the state-of-the-art advancements on various types of MEC sensors and their applications in POCT. Furthermore, the future perspectives, opportunities, and challenges in this field are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Routine identification of fungal pathogens from positive blood cultures by culture-based methods can be time-consuming, delaying treatment with appropriate antifungal agents. The GenMark Dx ePlex investigational use only blood culture identification fungal pathogen panel (BCID-FP) rapidly detects 15 fungal targets simultaneously in blood culture samples positive for fungi by Gram staining. We aimed to determine the performance of the BCID-FP in a multicenter clinical study. Blood culture samples collected at 10 United States sites and tested with BCID-FP at 4 sites were compared to the standard-of-care microbiological and biochemical techniques, fluorescence in situ hybridization using peptide nucleic acid probes (PNAFISH) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization--time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Discrepant results were analyzed by bi-directional PCR/ sequencing of residual blood culture samples. A total of 866 clinical samples, 120 retrospectively and 21 prospectively collected, along with 725 contrived samples were evaluated. Sensitivity and specificity of detection of Candida species (C. albicans, C. auris, C. dubliniensis, C. famata, C. glabrata, C. guilliermondii, C. kefyr, C. krusei, C. lusitaniae, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis) ranged from 97.1 to 100\% and 99.8 to 100\%, respectively. For the other organism targets, sensitivity and specificity were as follows: 100\% each for Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii, 98.6\% and 100\% for Fusarium spp., and 96.2\% and 99.9\% for Rhodotorula spp., respectively. In 4 of the 141 clinical samples, the BCID-FP panel correctly identified an additional Candida species, undetected by standard-of-care methods. The BCID-FP panel offers a faster turnaround time for identification of fungal pathogens in positive blood cultures that may allow for earlier antifungal interventions and includes C. auris, a highly multidrug-resistant fungus.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidics (DMF) is a technique for actively dispensing and manipulating discrete microdroplets on hydrophobic surfaces. DMF devices based on electrowetting on medium (EWOD) effect are widely used due to their advantages of fast response speed, simple system and high accuracy. Microfluidics is important for sweat sensing because it minimizes sweat pollution and evaporation of sweat on the skin. However, the current microfluidic channel has some problems, such as the old and new sweat is easy to mix in the channel, the self-driving efficiency is too low, and the small sweat volume cannot be detected in time. Digital microfluidics can accurately transmit small sweats, avoid sweat residue in the channel, and have high voltage drive efficiency. Therefore, in this paper, we will use DMF digital microfluidic array technology to realize the collection of trace sweat, and realize the collection and detection of micro-nano fabrication technology---photolithography. In this way, it is a microfluidic sweat sensor that realizes efficient transmission, trace detection, and intelligent monitoring, and is expected to be applied in wearable sweat sensing.},

In this Perspective, we first provide a quick review of existing magnetic microfluidic platforms with a focus on the magnetic tools and actuation mechanisms. Next, we discuss several emerging technologies, including magnetic microrobots, additive manufacture, and artificial intelligence, and their potential application in the future development of magnetic microfluidics. We believe that these technologies can eventually inspire highly functional magnetic tools for microfluidic manipulation and coordinated microfluidic control at the system level, which eventually drives magnetic microfluidics into an intelligent system for automated experimentation.},

  abstract = {Abstract             State-of-the-art microfluidic systems rely on relatively expensive and bulky off-chip infrastructures. The core of a system---the microfluidic chip---requires a clean room and dedicated skills to be fabricated. Thus, state-of-the-art microfluidic systems are barely accessible, especially for the do-it-yourself (DIY) community or enthusiasts. Recent emerging technology---3D-printing---has shown promise to fabricate microfluidic chips more simply, but the resulting chip is mainly hardened and single-layered and can hardly replace the state-of-the-art Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chip. There exists no convenient fluidic control mechanism yet suitable for the hardened single-layered chip, and particularly, the hardened single-layered chip cannot replicate the pneumatic valve---an essential actuator for automatically controlled microfluidics. Instead, 3D-printable non-pneumatic or manually actuated valve designs are reported, but their application is limited. Here, we present a low-cost accessible all-in-one portable microfluidic system, which uses an easy-to-print single-layered 3D-printed microfluidic chip along with a novel active control mechanism for fluids to enable more applications. This active control mechanism is based on air or gas interception and can, e.g., block, direct, and transport fluid. As a demonstration, we show the system can automatically control the fluid in microfluidic chips, which we designed and printed with a consumer-grade 3D-printer. The system is comparably compact and can automatically perform user-programmed experiments. All operations can be done directly on the system with no additional host device required. This work could support the spread of low budget accessible microfluidic systems as portable, usable on-the-go devices and increase the application field of 3D-printed microfluidic devices.},

Conventional microwell-based combinatorial screening is resource-demanding, and the closed microfluidics-based screening requires sophisticated fluidic control systems. In this work, we present a novel combinatorial screening platform based on the surface energy trap (SET)-assisted magnetic digital microfluidics. This platform, known as FlipDrop, rapidly generates chemical combinations by coupling two droplet arrays with orthogonal chemical concentration gradients with a simple flip. We have illustrated the working principle of FlipDrop by generating combinations of quantum dots. We have also successfully demonstrated the screening of quantum dot fluorescence resonance energy transfer (QD-FRET) on the FlipDrop platform by measuring the FRET response. This report demonstrates that FlipDrop is capable of rapidly generating chemical combinations with unprecedented ease for combinatorial screening.},

  abstract = {Reducing droplet/solid interfacial sliding resistance directly by applied voltage is still a scientific challenge. In this paper, the droplet/solid interfacial stick-slip behaviors were studied under different slew rates using an electrowettingon-dielectric device. Results showed that the slip amplitude and slip times of the triple contact line were significant changed by voltage slew rate signals. The triple contact line slipped at least eight times before saturation at 1 V/s, however, it slipped five and three times at 10 V/s and 50 V/s respectively. The slip amplitude increased by a factor of four when the voltage slew rate increased from 1 V/s to 50 V/s. Dynamics analysis indicated that the large slip amplitude was caused by inertia effect under high voltage slew rate. Moreover, the energy dissipation mechanisms transited from viscous dissipation to molecular friction dissipation with increasing of voltage slew rate. Results revealed that the sliding resistance decreased directedly by applied direct current voltage. Consequently, the droplet/solid interfacial sticky behaviors caused by applied voltage can be decreased without external setups, which is helpful for miniaturizing and integrating of microfluidic setups. Furthermore, the findings extend the understanding of the droplet/solid interfacial stick-slip mechanisms under applied voltage.},

  abstract = {The gas sensor based on pristine graphene with conductance type was studied theoretically and experimentally. The time response of conductance measurements showed a quickly and largely increased conductivity when the sensor was exposed to ammonia gas produced by a bubble system of ammonia water. However, the desorption process in vacuum took more than 1 h which indicated that there was a larger number of transferred carriers and a strong adsorption force between ammonia and graphene. The desorption time could be greatly shortened down to about 2 min by adding the flow of water-vapor-enriched air at the beginning of the recovery stage which had been confirmed as a rapid and high-efficiency desorption process. Moreover, the optimum geometries, adsorption energies, and the charge transfer number of the composite systems were studied with first-principle calculations. However, the theoretical results showed that the adsorption energy between NH3 and graphene was too small to fit for the experimental phenomenon, and there were few charges transferred between graphene and NH3 molecules, which was completely different from the experiment measurement. The adsorption energy between NH4 and graphene increased stage by stage which showed NH4 was a strong donor. The calculation suggested that H2O molecule could help a quick desorption of NH4 from graphene by converting NH4 to NH3 or (NH3)n(H2O)m groups, which was consistent with the experimental results. This study demonstrates that the ammonia gas produced by a bubble system of ammonia water is mainly ammonium groups of NH3 and NH4, and the NH4 moleculars are ideal candidates for the molecular doping of graphene while the interaction between graphene and the NH3 moleculars is weak.},

Here we present an ``additive-free'' magnetic actuation method to programmably manipulate droplets of water, organic, and biological fluids of arbitrary composition, as well as solid samples, on a ferrofluid-infused porous surface. We specifically exploit the spontaneously formed ferrofluid wetting ridges to actuate droplets using spatially varying magnetic fields. We demonstrate programmed processing and analysis of biological samples in individual drops as well as the collective actuation of large ensembles of micrometer-sized droplets. Such model respiratory droplets can be accumulated for improved quantitative and sensitive bioanalysis - an otherwise prohibitively difficult task that may be useful in tracking coronavirus.},

Basic operations such as droplet dispensing, mixing, dilution, localized heating, and incubation can be carried out using a 2-D array of electrodes and nanoliter volumes of liquid. The number of independent input pins used to control the electrodes in such microfluidic ``biochips'' is an important cost-driver, especially for disposable printed circuit board devices that are being developed for clinical and point-of-care diagnostics. However, most prior work on biochip design-automation has assumed independent control of the electrodes using a large number of input pins. We present a broadcast-addressing-based design technique for pin-constrained multifunctional biochips. The proposed method provides high throughput for bioassays and it reduces the number of control pins by identifying and connecting control pins with ``compatible'' actuation sequences. We also describe two scheduling methods to map fluidic operations on the pin-constrained design, in order to minimize the completion time while avoiding pinactuation conflicts. The proposed methods are evaluated using multifunctional chips designed to execute a set of multiplexed bioassays, the polymerase chain reaction, and a protein dilution assay.},

  abstract = {The number of independent input pins used to control the electrodes in digital microfluidic ``biochips'' is an important cost-driver in the emerging market place, especially for disposable PCB devices that are being developed for clinical and point-of-care diagnostics. However, most prior work on pin-constrained biochip design considers droplet routing and the assignment of pins to electrodes as independent problems. We propose an integer linear programming (ILP)based optimization method to solve the droplet-routing and the pin-mapping design problems concurrently. The proposed co-optimization method optimizes routing pathways, generates a single pin-assignment, and attempts to minimize the number of control pins. It also overcomes a major limitation of recent work on this problem---the method described in prior work can lead to infeasible designs due to the need to change the mapping of pins to electrodes dynamically during bioassay execution. The effectiveness of the proposed co-optimization method is demonstrated for a commercial biochip that is used to perform n-plex immunoassays, as well as an experimental chip for multiplexed in-vitro diagnostics.},

Since cross-contamination between droplets of different biomolecules can lead to erroneous outcomes for bioassays, the avoidance of cross-contamination during droplet routing is a key design challenge for biochips. We propose a droplet-routing method that avoids cross-contamination in the optimization of droplet flow paths. The proposed approach targets disjoint droplet routes and synchronizes wash-droplet routing with functional droplet routing, in order to reduce the duration of droplet routing while avoiding the cross-contamination between different droplet routes. In order to avoid cross-contamination between successive routing steps, an optimization technique is used to minimize the number of wash operations that must be used between successive routing steps. Two real-life biochemical applications are used to evaluate the proposed droplet-routing methods.},

Previously proposed techniques for reading test outcomes and for pulse-sequence analysis are cumbersome and error prone. We present a built-in self-test (BIST) method for digital microfluidic lab-on-chip. This method utilizes digital microfluidic logic gates to implement the BIST architecture; AND, OR and NOT gates are used to compress multiple test-outcome droplets into a single droplet to facilitate detection with low overhead. These approaches obviate the need for capacitive sensing test-outcome circuits for analysis. We also apply the BIST architecture to a pin-constrained biochip design.

  abstract = {Electrowetting on dielectric devices use a conducting (water) and insulating (oil) liquid phase, in conjunction, on a dielectric layer. In these devices, the wetting properties of the liquid phases can be manipulated by applying an electric field. The electric field can rupture the initially flat oil film and promotes further dewetting of the oil. Here we investigate a problem in the operation of electrowetting on dielectric caused by a finite conductivity of the oil. In particular, we find that the voltage at which the oil film ruptures sensitive to the application of relatively low DC voltages prior to switching. Here, we systematically investigate this dependence by controlled driving schemes. The mechanism behind these history effects point to charge transport processes in the dielectric and the oil, which can be modeled and characterized by a decay time. To quantify the effects the typical response timescales have been measured with a high speed video camera. The results have been reproduced in simulations. In addition, a simplified yet accurate equivalent circuit model is developed to analyze larger data sets more conveniently. The experimental data support the hypothesis that each pixel can be characterized by a single decay time. We studied an ensemble of pixels and found that they show a rather broad distribution of decay times with an average value of about 440ms. This decay time can be interpreted as a discharge timescale of the oil, not to be confused with discharge of the entire system which generally are much faster ({$<$} 1ms). Through the equivalent circuit model, we also found that variations in the FP conductivity cannot explain the distribution of decay times, while variations in oil conductivity can.},

A comprehensive review is presented on the EW research progress, and experiments, theoretical modeling and numerical simulations are covered. After a brief look at the development history, some latest experimental and simulation methods, such as Lattice Boltzmann method, phase-field method and molecular dynamics (MD), are introduced.

Synthesis tools have also emerged for the automated design of lab-on-chip from the specifications of laboratory protocols. However, none of these tools consider control flow or address the problem of recovering from fluidic errors that can occur during on-chip bioassay execution. We present a synthesis method that incorporates control paths and an error-recovery mechanism in the design of a digital microfluidic lab-on-chip. Based on error-propagation estimates, we determine the best locations for fluidic checkpoints during biochip synthesis. A microcontroller coordinates the implementation of the control-flow-based bioassay by intercepting the synthesis results that are mapped to the software programs. Real-life bioassay applications are used as case studies to evaluate the proposed design method. For a representative protein assay, compared to a baseline chip design, the biochip with a control path can reduce the completion time by 30\% when errors occur during the implementation of the bioassay.},

The theoretical background of three commonly used specificities of manipulation in magnetic liquids is first discussed, including the size, density and magnetic property of particles and cells. This is followed by a review and comparison of the media used in negative magnetophoresis, which include paramagnetic salt solutions and ferrofluids. Afterwards, the existing microfluidic applications of negative magnetophoresis are reviewed, including separation, focusing, trapping and concentration of particles and cells, determination of cell density, measurement of particles' magnetic susceptibility, and others. The need for developing biocompatible magnetic liquids for live cell manipulation and analysis and its recent progress are also examined.

To reduce product cost for disposable biochips, testing steps and functional fluidic operations must be implemented on pin-constrained designs. However, previous testing methods for pin-constrained designs do not optimize test schedules to reduce the number of control pins and test/assay completion time. We propose a pin-count-aware online testing method for pin-constrained designs to support the execution of both fault testing and the target bioassay protocol. The proposed method interleaves fault testing with the target bioassay protocol for online testing. It is aimed at significantly reducing the completion time for testing and for the bioassay, while keeping the number of control pins small. Two practical applications, namely a multiplexed bioassay and an interpolation-based mixing protocol, are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, traditional biosensing devices are expensive, bulky, and require a lot of time to detect, which also limited its application in resource-limited areas. In recent years, Lab-on-PCB, which combines biosensing technology and PCB technology, has been widely used in biomedical applications due to its high integration, personalized design, and easy mass production. Among these Lab-on-PCB sensing devices, the PCB circuit plays an important role. It can be directly used as a resistance sensor to count cells, and also used as a control device to automatically control the detection device. Flexible PCBs can be used to make wearable medical biosensors. In addition, due to the high degree of integration of the PCB circuit, Lab-on-PCB can perform multiple inspections on the same platform, which reduces the inspection time equivalently. Therefore, in this review paper, we discuss the application of Lab-on-PCB in four analysis methods of cell analysis, biochemical analysis, immunoassay, and molecular diagnosis, and give some suggestions for improvement and future development trends at the end.},

  abstract = {Disease diagnostics, food safety monitoring and environmental quality monitoring are the key means to safeguard human health. However, conventional detection devices for health care are costly, bulky and complex, restricting their applications in resource-limited areas of the world. With the rapid development of biosensors and the popularization of smartphones, smartphone-based sensing systems have emerged as novel detection devices that combine the sensitivity of biosensors and diverse functions of smartphones to provide a rapid, low-cost and convenient detection method. In these systems, the smartphone is used as a microscope to observe and count cells, as a camera to record fluorescence images, as an analytical platform to analyze experimental data, and as an effective tool to connect detection devices and online doctors. These systems are widely used for cell analysis, biochemical analysis, immunoassays, and molecular diagnosis, which are applied in the field of disease diagnostics, food safety monitoring and environmental quality monitoring. Therefore, we discuss the four types of smartphone-based sensing systems in this review paper, specifically in terms of the structure, performance and efficiency of these systems. At the last, we give some suggestions for improvement and future prospective trends.},

Since cross-contamination between droplets of different biomolecules can lead to erroneous outcomes for bioassays, it is essential to avoid cross-contamination during droplet routing. We propose a wash-operation synchronization method to manipulate wash droplets to clean the residue that is left behind by sample and reagent droplets. We also synchronize wash-droplet routing with sample/reagent droplet-routing steps by controlling the arrival order of droplets at cross-contamination sites. The proposed method minimizes droplet-routing time without cross-contamination, and it is especially effective for tight chip-area constraints. A real-life application is used for evaluation.},

In this paper, to resolve the lack of efficient methods for the 3-D actuation of nano-droplet with high tunability, we proposed the electro-wetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) driving scheme on a graphene surface. The droplet could be actuated when the EWOD saturated contact angle was reached, which determined the critical magnitude of E-field. The droplet velocity agreed well with the vcom {\textasciitilde} Ec-o1/2 law due to the film-detachment mechanism, which indicated the little viscous dissipation and good tunability for the proposed technique. The droplet velocity could also be tuned by changing the initial wettability of graphene surface. Detailed examination of the liquid-solid interface revealed the significant penetration of water molecules into the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) before the induction of droplet detachment, when the electric energy was converted into surface energy. For all cases studied, the saturated contact angle served as a sufficient condition for the actuation of droplet.},

  abstract = {This review critically summarizes the knowledge of imprinted polymer-based electrochemical sensors for the detection of pesticides, metal ions and waterborne pathogenic bacteria, focusing on the last five years. MIP-based electrochemical sensors exhibit low limits of detection (LOD), high selectivity, high sensitivity and low cost. We put the emphasis on the design of imprinted polymers and their composites and coatings by radical polymerization, oxidative polymerization of conjugated monomers or sol-gel chemistry. Whilst most imprinted polymers are used in conjunction with differential pulse or square wave voltammetry for sensing organics and metal ions, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) appears as the chief technique for detecting bacteria or their corresponding proteins. Interestingly, bacteria could also be probed via their quorum sensing signaling molecules or flagella proteins. If much has been developed in the past decade with glassy carbon or gold electrodes, it is clear that carbon paste electrodes of imprinted polymers are more and more investigated due to their versatility. Shortlisted case studies were critically reviewed and discussed; clearly, a plethora of tricky strategies of designing selective electrochemical sensors are offered to ``Imprinters''. We anticipate that this review will be of interest to experts and newcomers in the field who are paying time and effort combining electrochemical sensors with MIP technology.},

  abstract = {The dielectrowetting technique is an important method for controlling surface wettability. Herein, by combining the dielectrowetting technique with high-speed photography, the impact of a water drop on a surface with adjustable wettability is studied. Four different impact phenomena of the drop are identified, and the corresponding phase diagram is provided. As the surface wettability changes, the drop spreading factor and the dynamic contact angle differ for the same Weber number, exhibiting diverse drop behavior. A bubble entrapped on the surface is the most commonly observed phenomenon, and its maximum spreading factor and spreading time are dominated by the Weber number. However, its oscillation period and damping rate are independent of the Weber number. Moreover, a jet occurs on the surface with high hydrophobicity, and the inverse relationship between the jet velocity and radius is in good agreement with the theoretical model. Our work on drop impact based on the dielectrowetting effect can provide a new direction for the study of drop dynamics. Furthermore, the preparation method of the substrate with adjustable surface wettability could be applied in industrial fields such as inkjet printing and coating preparation.},

DEP requires particles to have the size within the range between hundreds of nanometers to tens of micrometers and a dielectric constant opposite to the liquid medium, which then could allow relatively sophisticated manipulation of a wide variety of colloidal sc ale objects, such as cells, microorganisms, polymeric colloids, and many more. Such unique ability has made DEP a great tool for applica-tions in fields such as biomedical research and materials science. For example, DEP can be applied to sort cells based on their different dielectric constants and morphologies. It could also be applied for cell viability monitoring and stem cell fate prediction. Provoking colloidal crystallization is another good example of the DEP application. Unlike small molecules, the unique ``colloidal scale'' renders these particles visible by optical microscopy. As a result, the combination of DEP and optical microscopy has become a powerful tool for materials scientists to investigate the phenomenon of colloidal crystal nucleation and growth directly. In this review, recent works regarding DEP's application on 2D colloidal crystallization will be discussed in detail. This review is intended to provide DEP's critical functions on two different research fields and demonstrate interdisciplinary potential of DEP.},

The majority of fabrication processes can conform to liquid-crystal style manufacturing equipment, and therefore can be readily adopted by many display practitioners. Also presented are additional tips and techniques, such as controlling the onset of oil film break-up in an electrowetting display.

By performing massive synthesis and characterization processes in parallel, it can rapidly discover materials with desired components, structures and functions. Among the various approaches for high-throughput screening, microfluidic platforms have attracted increasing attention. Compared with many current strategies that are generally based on robotic dispensers and automatic microplates, microfluidic platforms can significantly increase the throughput and reduce the consumption of reagents by several orders of magnitude. In this review, we first introduce current advances of the two types of microfluidic high-throughput platforms based on microarrays and microdroplets, respectively. Then the utilization of these platforms for screening different types of materials, including inorganic metals, metal alloys and organic polymers are described in detail.

A localized heating device, based on distributed electric field control, is constructed, where a polymer droplet on the lower substrate electrode is driven into a liquid column under the influence of a distributed electric field generated between two parallel substrate electrodes. ITO substrate electrodes with various patterns are fabricated, ensuring the shape of the formed liquid column matches the pattern. Leveraging the principles of heat transfer, the temperature of the polymer droplet is regulated via a heating stage to enable targeted heating of defined shapes and areas. Experiments delve into the impact of driving parameters on heating time and efficiency, with results affirming the proposed method's capability to govern localized heating for particular regions and configurations accurately.},

  abstract = {A significant growth of research on digital microfluidics has been achieved over the past several decades, and the field is still attracting increasing attention for fulfilling relevant mechanisms and potential applications. Numerous studies have been devoted to actively manipulating droplets in a variety of fundamental and applicational scenarios. In this work, the deformation of ferromagnetic fluid droplets is studied under an external uniform magnetic field. The droplets are precisely dispersed on the bottom surface of a container assembled with polymer methacrylate (PMMA) plates. Mineral oil is applied instead of air as the surrounding medium for easy stretching and preventing water solvent evaporation in ferrofluid. The design and processing of the container are firstly carried out to observe the shape and characterize the wettability of the droplets in the immiscible mineral oil medium. Furthermore, the droplets' deformation and the working mechanism are given under the action of the horizontal uniform magnetic field. At different magnetic field intensities, the droplet is stretched in the horizontal direction parallel to the applied field. Due to volume conservation, the dimension in the height reduces correspondingly. With the coupling effect of magnetic force, viscous force and interfacial tension, the contact angle first increases with the magnetic field and then basically remains unchanged upon magnetization saturation. Consistent with the experimental results, the numerical method clearly reveals the field coupling mechanism and the nonlinear deformation of the sessile droplet.},

Immobilisation of enzymes was shown to be a crucial step in the development of the biosensors; the use of glycerol and lactitol as stabilisers resulted in a significant improvement, especially in the case of the creatinine, of the operational stability of the biosensors (from few hours to at least 3 days).

  abstract = {The permeation of polar molecules (water and ammonia), non-polar dichloromethane and a mixture of ammonia and dichloromethane through graphene oxide (GO)/polymer matrix composite membranes was investigated. Results indicated that a hydrophilic poly(2-acrylamido -2 -methyl propane sulfonic acid) (PAMPS) based membrane had the highest permeability for water and ammonia due to the high hydrophilicity of the polymer matrix while a hydrophobic polyurethane (PU)-based membrane had the best permeation performance for dichloromethane and the worst performance for water and ammonia. Adding the GO to PU or PAMPS polymers increases the negative charge due to the negatively charged nature of GO caused by its oxygen-containing functional groups, which increases the amounts of absorbed water and ammonia due to the positive charge of the hydrogen atoms in these two molecules.},

  abstract = {To explore genome mutation meaningfully, it is in urgent need to develop an automated and inexpensive platform for DNA mutation analysis. Digital microfluidics is a powerful platform for a broad range of applications due to the advantages of high automatization and low reagent consumption. Pyrosequencing enables DNA sequencing based on non-electrophoresis bioluminescence, which is suitable for rapid and sensitive analysis of short sequences. Herein, we describe a palmtop sequencing platform for automatic, real-time and portable analysis of DNA mutations, which is based on the pyrosequencing principle and implemented by digital microfluidics. The portable system can sequence a DNA template with up to 53 bp with 100\% accuracy within 2 h. Mutation in the KRAS gene can be detected within 30 min with a LOD as low as 5\% mutant level. Portable and accurate gender identification was further demonstrated by sequencing a short amelogenin fragment. With the advantages of portability, ease of use, high accuracy, and low cost, the palmtop sequencing platform shows great potential for portable genetic testing in a variety of circumstances.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the number of interdisciplinary research works related to the development of miniaturized systems with integrated chemical and biological analyses is increasing. Digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) are one kind of miniaturized systems designed for conducting inexpensive, fast, convenient and reliable biochemical assay procedures focusing on basic scientific research and medical diagnostics. The role of a dielectric layer in the digital microfluidic biochips is prominent as it helps in actuating microliter droplets based on the electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) technique. The advantages of using three different material layers of dielectric such as parafilm, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) were reported in the current work. A simple fabrication process of a digital microfluidic device was performed and good results were obtained. The threshold of the actuation voltage was determined for all dielectric materials of varying thicknesses. Additionally, the OpenDrop device was tested by utilizing a single-plate system to transport microliter droplets for a bioassay operation. With the newly proposed fabrication methods, these dielectric materials showed changes in contact angle and droplet velocity when the actuation voltage was applied. The threshold actuation voltage for the dielectric layers of 10--13 {\textmu}m was 190 V for the open plate DMFBs.},

  abstract = {Microfluidics technology dominates laboratory facilities as microscale devices where large scale of laboratories equipment no longer needed. These microfluidic devices are very useful in many applications including clinical diagnostics and cell based analysis, where micro to nano liter range of samples can be used to run the bioassays. Recently, various study of digital microfluidic devices have been done and the fabrication techniques used have shown to be expensive. In this paper, a low cost open plate droplet-based digital microfluidic devices using Electrowetting on Dielectrics (EWOD) technique is fabricated and experimentally demonstrated. The proposed system features a 2x4 electrodes array on a standard FR4 printed circuit board (PCB) technology. In this method, open dropletbased microfluidic device is formed from copper substrates with a gap width of 203.2 {$\mu$}m between the inter-electrode. By replacing the expensive dielectric and hydrophobic coatings materials such as parylene-C and Teflon-AF, saran wrap (polyethylene film) and cooking oil has been used, respectively. Additionally, the system has been tested for open EWOD configuration by dispensing 2.5 {$\mu$}L of distilled water. Thus, a low cost of fabrication method enables the system setup of digital microfluidics without the need of clean room facilities.},
