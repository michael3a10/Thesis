\section{Research Objectives}
The main objective of this research is to develop a portable and scalable DMF platform for multiple Salmonella bacteria species detection. Specific objectives are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To develop a DMF platform for move, merge, split and dispense Salmonella bacteria sample in microliter (\textmugreek L)
    \item To integrate the developed DMF platform with an array of EC sensors
    \item To develop and evaluate Fuzzy Logic in determining the presence of Salmonella species within a sample.
\end{enumerate}
