Methods:               Twelve clinical practice guidelines were reviewed regarding inclusion of important laboratory investigations. Based on the results and the authors’ experience, two checklists were developed: one comprehensive list including topics that authors of guidelines may consider and one consisting of minimal standards that should be covered for all laboratory tests recommended in clinical practice guidelines. The number of topics addressed by the guidelines was related to involvement of laboratory medicine specialists in the guideline development process.                                         Results:               The comprehensive list suggests 33 pre- analytical, 37 analytical and 10 post-analytical items. The mean percentage of topics dealt with by the guidelines was 33\% (median 30\%, range 17\%–55\%) and inclusion of a laboratory medicine specialist in the guideline committee significantly increased the number of topics addressed. Information about patient status, biological and analytical interferences and sample handling were scarce in most guidelines even if the inclusion of a laboratory medicine specialist in the development process seemingly led to increased focus on, e.g., sample type, sample handling and analytical variation. Examples underlining the importance of including laboratory items are given.                                         Conclusions:               Inclusion of laboratory medicine specialist in the guideline development process may increase the focus on important laboratory related items even if this information is usually limited. Two checklists are suggested to help guideline developers to cover all important topics related to laboratory testing.},

Particularly, the detection of ammonia gas is very important for many industries due to its toxicity and environmental hazards. The hybrid nanostructures formed by blending of nanoparticles of metal/metal-oxides with polymer or its derivatives have been explored which showed improved gas sensing ability and selectivity at room temperature. This article reviews ammonia gas sensors based on semiconducting materials like metals, metal oxides, metal oxide-polymers and carbon nanotubes (CNT’s) based hybrid nanostructures for different level of detection of ammonia in various applications. The characteristic performance parameters of these sensors, such as measuring range, sensitivity, selectivity, response/recovery time and the latest technological developments are discussed with detailed analysis in this article.},

But fluid flow controlling on microfluidics paperbased analytical devices (µPADs) and post-processing on DMF devices have limitations. In this work a new hybrid paper-based device is proposed with the aim of resolving these limitations and expanding the microfluidics capabilities in point of care diagnostics. The hybrid paper-based microfluidics (HPMF) device is composed of a DMF device following a µPAD in a single substrate, in which the DMF part performs the preprocessing steps of the test on droplets and transfers the resulting droplet to the µPAD part of the device for post-processing steps. The fabrication process of the device is rapid and very low cost due to use of paper substrate and out of clean-room processes. The results show that the proposed HPMF device can perform droplet operations: moving, mixing, and splitting.},

The proposed device is disposable, and its fabrication procedure is simple, fast, and low cost which allows creation of a new device for each individual experiment.

The as-synthesized α-Fe2O3 nanoellipsoids are characterized in terms of their morphological, structural and optical properties. The detailed structural and optical properties confirm a rhombohedral α-Fe2O3 structure and indirect (1.87 eV) and direct (2.15 eV) band gaps, respectively, for the synthesized nanoellipsoids. The fabricated aqueous ammonia sensor based on nanoellipsoids exhibits a very high and reproducible sensitivity of ∼4.678 µA cm−2 mM−1 and a detection limit of ∼0.04 nM with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.995 in a short response time (10.0 s). The presented work demonstrates that simply synthesized iron oxide nanostructures can efficiently be used for the fabrication of reliable and reproducible chemical sensors.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidics is a popular tool for lab-on-a-chip applications and is typically implemented in one of two formats: single-plate (“open”) devices or two-plate (“closed”) devices. Single-plate devices have some advantages relative to the more common two-plate format such as faster mixing, the capacity to move larger volumes on a given footprint, and easier access to droplets for handling or optical detection. In contrast with the two-plate format, in which ground potential is generally supplied via a top electrode, in the single-plate format, many different geometries of ground wires/electrodes have been used. Until the present study, there has been no metric to determine which of these geometries is best suited for droplet actuation. Here, we present a combination of numerical simulations and experimental tests to compare six different single-plate designs. We applied finite element analysis, using the commercially available COMSOL software package to calculate the electrodynamic actuation forces in each of the different designs and used the results to optimize device design. Forces predicted by the electrodynamic model were in agreement with forces predicted using electromechanical models. More importantly, results were verified experimentally using a unique technique that permits indirect estimation of actuation forces on digital microfluidic devices. This work illustrates the promise of using numerical modeling to enhance the design and performance of digital microfluidic devices.},

This technology proposes considerable improvements in terms of experiment speed, configurability and consumed experiment materials. In this paper a novel pin-constrained digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) architecture is introduced for general-purpose assay execution. The proposed DMFB enjoys cost-saving of pin-constrained designs while providing general-purpose assay execution comparable with direct-addressing DMFBs and retains the same level of functionality as previous pin-constrained designs with lower number of electrodes and in turn lower number of control pins. The experimental results show that while reducing number of electrodes and control pins we managed to achieve the same level of performance; regarding number of electrodes 20 \% and 56 \% improvements were obtained compared with pin-constrained and direct-addressing designs respectively. Considering number of control pins the proposed design enjoys 3 \% and 572 \% improvements compared with pin-constrained and directaddressing designs, respectively. Furthermore, since the availability of various routing paths, the proposed design offers droplet-routing times comparatively lower than previous pinconstrained designs; the routing times were reduced by 17 \% and 23 \% compared with pin-constrained and direct-addressing designs, respectively.},

This paper reports the development of DMF devices using low-cost materials and simple deposition techniques specifically for the device dielectric component. Three commercial polyurethane coatings were investigated for their feasibility as the dielectric layer. The electrowetting behaviour of these materials was investigated by evaluating the change in contact angle with applied voltage of a water droplet sitting on the dielectric samples prepared using easy deposition methods such as spraying and spin coating. Devices were then fabricated using these materials to evaluate their capability to actuate droplets. Five types of polyurethane dielectric sample exhibited contact angle reversibility with hysteresis ranging between 4° to 25° after 250 VDC application. Droplet transportation back and forth across 8 electrodes at 180 VRMS has been demonstrated in a device made of one of the polyurethane coatings using a spraying technique. This result implies the potential of using polyurethane for future development of low-cost and disposable DMF devices.},

  abstract = {Magnetic nanoparticles have attracted significant attention in various disciplines, including engineering and medicine. Microfluidic chips and lab-on-a-chip devices, with precise control over small volumes of fluids and tiny particles, are appropriate tools for the synthesis, manipulation, and evaluation of nanoparticles. Moreover, the controllability and automation offered by the microfluidic chips in combination with the unique capabilities of the magnetic nanoparticles and their ability to be remotely controlled and detected, have recently provided tremendous advances in biotechnology. In particular, microfluidic chips with magnetic nanoparticles serve as sensitive, high throughput, and portable devices for contactless detecting and manipulating DNAs, RNAs, living cells, and viruses. In this work, we review recent fundamental advances in the field with a focus on biomedical applications. First, we study novel microfluidic-based methods in synthesizing magnetic nanoparticles as well as microparticles encapsulating them. We review both continues-flow and droplet-based microreactors, including the ones based on the cross-flow, co-flow, and flow-focusing methods. Then, we investigate the microfluidic-based methods for manipulating tiny magnetic particles. These manipulation techniques include the ones based on external magnets, embedded micro-coils, and magnetic thin films. Finally, we review techniques invented for the detection and magnetic measurement of magnetic nanoparticles and magnetically labeled bioparticles. We include the advances in anisotropic magnetoresistive, giant magnetoresistive, tunneling magnetoresistive, and magnetorelaxometry sensors. Overall, this review covers a wide range of the field uniquely and provides essential information for designing “lab-on-a-chip” systems for synthesizing magnetic nanoparticles, labeling bioparticles with them, and sorting and detecting them on a single chip.},

  abstract = {In systems for food analysis, one of the major challenges is related to the quantification of specific species into the complex chemical and physical composition of foods, that is, the effect of “matrix”; the sample preparation is often the key to a successful application of biosensors to real measurements but little attention is traditionally paid to such aspects in sensor research. In this critical review, we discuss several microfluidic concepts that can play a significant role in sample preparation, highlighting the importance of sample preparation for efficient detection of food contamination. As a case study, we focus on the challenges related to the detection of aflatoxin                                                                                               M                                                                 1                                                                                       in milk and we evaluate possible approaches based on inertial microfluidics, electrophoresis, and acoustic separation, compared with traditional laboratory and industrial methods for phase separation as a baseline of thrust and well-established techniques.},

Hence, it is important to develop high‐performance sensors that precisely measure nitrite concentration. Herein, the fabrication of a highly sensitive nonenzymatic nitrite sensor based on Fe               2               O               3               nanoparticle coated ZnO nanorods (Fe               2               O               3               NP coated ZnO NRs) is demonstrated. The ZnO NRs are grown on a seeded silver electrode by a hydrothermal method and then coated under optimized conditions with Fe               2               O               3               NPs using a dip‐coating method. Detailed material characterizations and sensor fabrication process are reported. The electrochemical properties of a fabricated nonenzymatic nitrite sensor are tested with different concentrations of nitrite, which indicates that the coating of ZnO NRs with Fe               2               O               3               NPs significantly enhances the electrocatalytic activity.

  abstract = {A new microfluidic platform that integrates droplet and digital microfluidics to automate a variety of fluidic operations. The platform was applied to culturing and to selecting yeast mutant cells in ionic liquid.           ,                             Droplet microfluidics is a technique that has the ability to compartmentalize reactions in sub nano- (or pico-) liter volumes that can potentially enable millions of distinct biological assays to be performed on individual cells. In a typical droplet microfluidic system, droplets are manipulated by pressure-based flows. This has limited the fluidic operations that can be performed in these devices. Digital microfluidics is an alternative microfluidic paradigm with precise control and manipulation over individual droplets. Here, we implement an integrated droplet-digital microfluidic (which we call ‘ID2M’) system in which common fluidic operations (               i.e.               droplet generation, cell encapsulation, droplet merging and mixing, droplet trapping and incubation, and droplet sorting) can be performed. With the addition of electrodes, we have been able to create droplets on-demand, tune their volumes on-demand, and merge and mix several droplets to produce a dilution series. Moreover, this device can trap and incubate droplets for 24 h that can consequently be sorted and analyzed in multiple n-ary channels (as opposed to typical binary channels). The ID2M platform has been validated as a robust on-demand screening system by sorting fluorescein droplets of different concentration with an efficiency of ∼96\%. The utility of the new system is further demonstrated by culturing and sorting tolerant yeast mutants and wild-type yeast cells in ionic liquid based on their growth profiles. This new platform for both droplet and digital microfluidics has the potential to be used for screening different conditions on-chip and for applications like directed evolution.},

  abstract = {In this paper, microdroplet evaporation in the closed digital microfluidic systems is studied for hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. The contact angle and contact radius are measured by an enhanced automated polynomial fitting approach. It is observed that the contact angle for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces remains constant during the evaporation process. However, a higher evaporation rate is observed for hydrophilic droplets compared to the hydrophobic droplets. Since no contact line pinning is observed, first, an analytical model based on the uniform vapor mass flux along the liquid–vapor interface is proposed. Interestingly, it is observed that in the hydrophobic case, the analytical model gives a higher evaporation rate, whereas for the hydrophilic case, the analytical model gives a lower evaporation rate. The discrepancy between the results of the analytical modeling and the experimental values is hypothesized to be due the constant flux assumption. To verify the hypothesis, a finite volume-based numerical model is developed to find the local flux along the liquid–vapor interface. The numerical modeling results confirm that for hydrophilic droplets, the evaporation flux increases very close to the three-phase contact line. In the case of the hydrophobic droplets, on the other hand, the flux decreases close to the contact line due to vapor saturation; as a result the uniform flux assumption overestimates the mass loss.},

SDB is a chronic disease that may lead to several health problems and increase the risk of high blood pressure and even heart attack. Therefore, the diagnosis of SDB at an early stage is very important. The essential primary step before diagnosis is measurement. Vital health parameters related to SBD might be measured through invasive or non-invasive methods. Nowadays, with respect to increase in aging population, improvement in home health management systems is needed more than even a decade ago. Moreover, traditional health parameter measurement techniques such as polysomnography are not comfortable and introduce additional costs to the consumers. Therefore, in modern advanced self-health management devices, electronics and communication science are combined to provide appliances that can be used for SDB diagnosis, by monitoring a patient’s physiological parameters with more comfort and accuracy. Additionally, development in machine learning algorithms provides accurate methods of analysing measured signals. This paper provides a comprehensive review of measurement approaches, data transmission, and communication networks, alongside machine learning algorithms for sleep stage classification, to diagnose SDB.},

Therefore, the characterization and optimization of the interaction of chemical and biological solutions through microfluidic channels are vital for fluid flow design and engineering for quality assurance in microfluidic platforms. As the internal structures and kinetics of microfluidic channels are becoming increasingly complex, experiments involving optimal fluidic and transport designs are challenging to perform with high accuracy. However, highly integrated simulation tools can guide researchers without specialized computational fluid backgrounds to design numerical prototypes of highly integrated devices. In this study, a microfluidic chip with two inlet wells and one outlet well was fabricated from polydimethylsiloxane following which simulations were performed using an ANSYS Fluent tool influenced by computational fluid dynamics at a nearly identical scale. The pressure drop and velocity profiles of the interaction of two pH buffer solutions (pH 4 and 10) through the designed microfluidic chip were qualitatively estimated from experimental data analysis and validated with the simulation results obtained from the CFD-influenced ANSYS Fluent tool.},

  abstract = {In this study, a surface acoustic wave (SAW)-based microfluidic device has been developed to separate heterogeneous particle or cell mixtures in a continuous flow using acoustophoresis. The microfluidic device is comprised of two components, a SAW transducer and a microfluidic channel made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The SAW transducer was fabricated by patterning two pairs of interdigital electrodes on a lithium niobate (LiNbO3) piezoelectric substrate. When exciting the SAW transducer by AC signals, a standing SAW is generated along the cross-section of the channel. Solid particles immersed in the standing SAW field are accordingly pushed to the pressure node arising from the acoustic radiation force acting on the particles, referring to the acoustic particle-focusing phenomenon. Acoustic radiation force highly depends on the particle properties, resulting in different acoustic responses for different types of cells. A numerical model, coupling the piezoelectric effect in the solid substrate and acoustic pressure in the fluid, was developed to provide a better understanding of SAW-based particle manipulation. Separation of two types of fluorescent particles has been demonstrated using the developed SAW-based microfluidic device. An efficient separation of E. coli bacteria from peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples has also been successfully achieved. The purity of separated E. coli bacteria and separated PBMCs were over 95\% and 91\%, respectively, obtained by a flow cytometric analysis. The developed microfluidic device can efficiently separate E. coli bacteria from biological samples, which has potential applications in biomedical analysis and clinical diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Human activities continue to affect our water quality; it remains a major problem worldwide (particularly concerning freshwater and human consumption). A critical water quality index (WQI) method has been used to determine the overall water quality status of surface water and groundwater systems globally since the 1960s. WQI follows four steps: parameter selection, subindices, establishing weights, and final index aggregation, which are addressed in this review. However, the WQI method is a prolonged process and applied to specific water quality parameters, i.e., water consumption (particular area and time) and other purposes. Therefore, this review discusses the WQI method in simple steps, for water quality assessment, based on two multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods: (1) analytical hierarchical process (AHP); and (2) measuring attractiveness by a categorically based evaluation technique (MACBETH). MCDM methods can facilitate easy calculations, with less effort and great accuracy. Moreover, the uncertainty and eclipsing problems are also discussed—a challenge at every step of WQI development, particularly for parameter selection and establishing weights. This review will help provide water management authorities with useful knowledge pertaining to water usage or modification of existing indicators globally, and contribute to future WQI planning and studies for drinking, irrigation, domestic, and industrial purposes.},

  abstract = {Despite the recent advances in food preservation techniques and food safety, significant disease outbreaks linked to foodborne pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses still occur worldwide indicating that these pathogens still constitute significant risks to public health. Although extensive reviews of methods for foodborne pathogens detection exist, most are skewed towards bacteria despite the increasing relevance of other pathogens such as viruses. Therefore, this review of foodborne pathogen detection methods is holistic, focusing on pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and viruses. This review has shown that culture-based methods allied with new approaches are beneficial for the detection of foodborne pathogens. The current application of immunoassay methods, especially for bacterial and fungal toxins detection in foods, are reviewed. The use and benefits of nucleic acid-based PCR methods and next-generation sequencing-based methods for bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens’ detection and their toxins in foods are also reviewed. This review has, therefore, shown that different modern methods exist for the detection of current and emerging foodborne bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens. It provides further evidence that the full utilization of these tools can lead to early detection and control of foodborne diseases, enhancing public health and reducing the frequency of disease outbreaks.},

The system is capable of measuring nitrate concentrations in the range of 0.01 to 0.5 mg/L in ground and surface water. This study extends our earlier work by including a temperature compensation capacity within the sensor. WiFi-based Internet of Things (IoT) has been included making it a connected sensing system. The system is capable of sending data directly to an IoTbased web server, which will be useful to develop distributed monitoring systems in the future.

  abstract = {Recent developments in the field of microwave planar sensors have led to a renewed interest in industrial, chemical, biological and medical applications that are capable of performing real-time and non-invasive measurement of material properties. Among the plausible advantages of microwave planar sensors is that they have a compact size, a low cost and the ease of fabrication and integration compared to prevailing sensors. However, some of their main drawbacks can be considered that restrict their usage and limit the range of applications such as their sensitivity and selectivity. The development of high-sensitivity microwave planar sensors is required for highly accurate complex permittivity measurements to monitor the small variations among different material samples. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to review recent research on the development of microwave planar sensors and further challenges of their sensitivity and selectivity. Furthermore, the techniques of the complex permittivity extraction (real and imaginary parts) are discussed based on the different approaches of mathematical models. The outcomes of this review may facilitate improvements of and an alternative solution for the enhancement of microwave planar sensors’ normalized sensitivity for material characterization, especially in biochemical and beverage industry applications.},

  abstract = {Rapid, accurate and inexpensive monitoring of water quality parameters is indispensable for continued water safety, especially in resource-limited areas. Most conventional sensing systems either can only monitor one parameter at a time or lack userfriendly on-site monitoring capabilities. A fully integrated electrochemical sensors array is an excellent solution to this barrier. Electrochemical sensing methods involve transduction of water quality parameters where chemical interactions are converted to electrical signals. The challenge remains in designing low-cost, easy-to-use and highly sensitive sensors array that can continuously monitor major water quality parameters such as pH, free chlorine, temperature along with emerging pharmaceutical contaminants and heavy-metal without the use of expensive laboratory based techniques and trained personnel. Here, we overcame this challenge through realizing a fully-integrated electrochemical sensing system that offers simultaneous monitoring of pH (57.5 mV/pH), free chlorine (186 nA/ppm), and temperature (16.9 mV/∞C); and on-demand monitoring of acetaminophen and \$5F ! ({$<$}10 nM), and heavy-metal ({$<$}10 ppb) ñ bridging the technological gap between signal transduction, processing, wireless-transmission and smartphone interfacing. This was achieved by merging nanomaterials, and carbon nanotubes based sensors fabricated on microscope glass slides controlled by a custom-designed readout circuit, a potentiostat and an Android app. The sensing system can be easily modified and programmed to integrate other sensors, a capability that can be exploited to monitor a range of water quality parameters. We demonstrate the integrated system for monitoring tap, swimming pool and lake water. This system opens the possibility for a wide range of low-cost and ubiquitous environmental monitoring applications.},

  abstract = {Microfluidic-based biochips are replacing the conventional biochemical analyzers, and are able to integrate onchip all the necessary functions for biochemical analysis using microfluidics. The digital microfluidic biochips are based on the manipulation of liquids not as a continuous flow, but as discrete droplets on an array of electrodes. Microfluidic operations, such as transport, mixing, split, are performed on this array by routing the corresponding droplets on a series of electrodes. Several approaches have been proposed for the compilation of digital microfluidic biochips, which, starting from a biochemical application and a given biochip architecture, determine the allocation, resource binding, scheduling, placement and routing of the operations in the application. To simplify the compilation problem, researchers have assumed an abstract droplet size of one electrode. However, the droplet size abstraction is not realistic and it impacts negatively the execution of the biochemical application, leading in most cases to its failure. Hence the existing compilation approaches have to be revisited to consider the size of the droplets. In this paper we take the first step towards a droplet size-aware compilation by proposing a routing algorithm that considers the droplet size. Our routing algorithm is developed for a novel digital microfluidic biochip architecture based on Active Matrix Electrowetting on Dielectric, which uses a thin film transistor array for the electrodes. We also implement a simulator that allows us to perform the needed adaptations and to validate the proposed routing algorithm.},

We report on two years of use of OPENDROP, released as an open-source platform. Our platform attracted a highly diverse user base with participants originating from maker communities, academia and industry. Our findings show that 47\% of attempts to replicate OPENDROP were successful, the main challenge remaining the assembly of the device.

  abstract = {Conducting polymers (CPs) represent a sizeable range of useful organic substances. Their unique electrical, chemical, and physical properties; reasonable price; simple preparation; small dimensions; and large surface area have enabled researchers to discover a wide variety of uses, including sensors, supercapacitors, solar cells, batteries, biochemical applications, and electrochromic devices. To promote the success of CPs, unique composite materials have been prepared with metals or steel oxides. The goal of this overview is to characterize the electrochemical sensor utility of CPs and their composites and to categorize future components of electrochemical sensing materials. CPs have been comprehensively applied over a wide range of variable industrial fields; such CPs have used many new materials with diverse compositions that are utilized as electrochemical sensors and biosensors. These materials have been fabricated inside numerous analytical instruments that are applied in healthcare settings and clinical, environmental, food, and pharmaceutical laboratories. Electrochemical sensors are essentially based on CPs and/or their corresponding composite materials. Therefore, the present work provides a brief illustration of electrochemical sensor and biosensor applications for the most important conducting polymer composite materials. Polyaniline (PANI), poly(o-toluidine) (PoT), and poly(o-anisidine) (PoAN) were considered in this study. Moreover, the most important electrochemical properties of these conducting polymer composite materials are discussed.},

  abstract = {Electrochemical techniques were successfully employed to estimate contamination of water of river Buriganga, Bangladesh. A Pt–Cu electrode has been exploited to measure selective nitrate concentration, and corrosion rate of iron has been proposed to indicate relative abundance of dissolved contaminants. In order to evaluate the pollution level, water parameters of river Buriganga have been compared with those obtained from two freshwater streams named Surma and Dawki of the country. An iron strip in contact with Buriganga river water is corroded three times rapidly compared to its contact with Dawki or Surma river water indicates acute contamination of Buriganga river water. The River Buriganga is facing acute pollution from the point of high TDS (0.664–0.694 g/L), low DO (1.47–4.4 mg/L), high COD (197–218 mg/L), high ammonia (270–420 mg/L) and high nitrate concentration (107–157 mg/L). Negative ORP value (− 292 to − 310 mV) of Buriganga river water indicates that the stream contains high level reducing species. Meanwhile, positive ORP value indicates that Dawki (+ 203 to + 209 mV) and Surma (+ 184 to + 205 mV) river water contain oxidizing species. Sediment analysis shows the deposition of disintegrated organic pollutants on the bottom of the River Buriganga. Cost-effective carbon material synthesized from taro stems has been proposed to restore water parameters of filthy water system like Buriganga river.},

However, fabrication of microfluidic devices is often complicated, time consuming, and requires expensive equipment and sophisticated cleanroom facilities. Three-dimensional (3D) printing presents a promising alternative to traditional techniques such as lithography and PDMS-glass bonding, not only by enabling rapid design iterations in the development stage, but also by reducing the costs associated with institutional infrastructure, equipment installation, maintenance, and physical space. With the recent advancements in 3D printing technologies, highly complex microfluidic devices can be fabricated via single-step, rapid, and cost-effective protocols, making microfluidics more accessible to users. In this review, we discuss a broad range of approaches for the application of 3D printing technology to fabrication of micro-scale lab-on-a-chip devices.},

The results were compared with experimental data and the results show good accuracy of the numerical simulation. Also, the stability of a droplet in a finite system was studied analytically and numerically (by LBM) and it was shown that the droplet stability is a function of system size and droplet contact angle. The simulation results were in good agreement with analytical solution and it has been concluded that in the finite systems an unstable droplet can be stabilized by applying a voltage (i.e., using EW). Based on this observation, a new method for droplets merging in finite systems has been proposed.},

  abstract = {Invasive Salmonellosis caused by Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi or Paratyphi A, B, C, or invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella serotypes, is an immensely important disease cluster for which reliable, rapid diagnostic tests are not available. Blood culture remains the gold standard but is insensitive, slow, and resource-intensive. Existing molecular diagnostics have poor sensitivity due to the low organism burden in bodily fluids. Commercially available serologic tests for typhoidal Salmonella have had limited sensitivity and specificity. In high burden, resource-limited settings, reliance on clinical diagnosis or inaccurate tests often results in frequent, unnecessary treatment, which contributes selective pressure for the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. This practice also results in inadequate therapy for other etiologies of acute febrile illnesses, including leptospirosis and rickettsial infections. A number of novel serologic, molecular, transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches to diagnostics are under development. Target product profiles that outline specific needs may focus development and investment, and establish benchmarks for accuracy, cost, speed, and portability of new diagnostics. Of note, a critical barrier to diagnostic assay rollout will be the low cost and low perceived harm of empiric therapy on behalf of providers and patients, which leaves few perceived incentives to utilize diagnostics. Approaches that align incentives with societal goals of limiting inappropriate antimicrobial use, such as subsidizing diagnostics, may be essential for stimulating development and uptake of such assays in resource-limited settings. New diagnostics for invasive Salmonellosis should be developed and deployed alongside diagnostics for alternative etiologies of acute febrile illnesses to improve targeted use of antibiotics.},

  abstract = {Precise, tunable emulsions and foams produced in microfluidic geometries have found wide application in biochemical analysis and materials synthesis and characterization. Superb control of the volume, uniformity, and generation rate of droplets and bubbles arises from unique features of the microscale behavior of fluid interfaces. Fluid interfaces confined within microfluidic channels behave quite differently than their counterparts in unbounded flows. Confinement inhibits capillary instabilities so that breakup occurs by largely quasi-static mechanisms. The three-dimensional flow near confined interfaces in rectangular geometries and feedback effects from resistance changes in the entire microfluidic network play important roles in regulating the interfacial deformation. Timescales for transport of surfactants and particles to interfaces compete with flow timescales at the microscale, providing further opportunity for tuning the interfacial coverage and properties of individual droplets and bubbles.},

  abstract = {The static shape of droplets under electrowetting actuation is well-understood. The steady-state shape of the droplet is obtained based on the balance of surface tension and electrowetting forces, and the change in apparent contact angle is well-characterized by the Young-Lippmann equation. However, the transient droplet shape behavior when a voltage is suddenly applied across a droplet has received less attention. Additional dynamic frictional forces are at play during this transient process. We present a model to predict this transient behavior of the droplet shape under electrowetting actuation. The droplet shape is modeled using the volume of fluid method. The electrowetting and dynamic frictional forces are included as an effective dynamic contact angle through a force balance at the contact line. The model is used to predict the transient behavior of water droplets on smooth hydrophobic surfaces under electrowetting actuation. The predictions of transient behavior of droplet shape and contact radius are in excellent agreement our experimental measurements. The internal fluid motion is explained and the droplet motion is shown to initiate from the contact line. An approximate mathematical model is also developed to understand the physics of the droplet motion and to describe the overall droplet motion and the contact line velocities.},

  abstract = {Background               Infectious diseases contribute to a high burden of diseases globally. Surveillance using low-cost technology, combined with cutting edge platforms offers a path for understanding the disease ecology of locations of interest in resource-poor countries. Our goal was to pilot a bio surveillance system comprising of rapid lateral flow immunoassays, rapid PCR and a cloud database.                                         Methods                                The study was carried out in Bo, Sierra Leone at the Mercy Hospital. We recruited 1570 subjects over a period of two years. Inclusion criteria for the study were being febrile, being at least five years of age, living within the city of Bo or its neighbouring villages and agreeing to participate in the study. The assays used included a DPP multiplex lateral flow assay for dengue,                 Burkholderia pseudomallei                 ,                 Yersinia pestis                 , malaria Pf/Pan, a Film Array PCR platform with multiplex Biothreat and SASFI panels that together detect over 30 pathogen targets. We used a Deki Reader to upload lateral flow images to the cloud database. The Deki reader quantitates test results, such that scores at ≥1.75 are considered positive. A special computer program was designed to upload pdf images of PCR results to the cloud database. The cloud database was designed for automated quality assessment and remote monitoring.                                                        Results                                Preliminary results show that out of 1570 samples processed by DPP, 30(1.9\%) were positive for Burkholderia, 41(2.6\%) were positive for Dengue NS1 antigen, 22(1.4\%) were positive for                 Yesinia pestis                 fraction 1 antigen, and 340(21.7\%) were positive for malaria. When a cross-section of results obtained by eye was compared with results automatically detected by the D2C platform, there was 95.2\% concordance between results obtained by eye and those obtained automatically by the Deki reader to the cloud database.                                                        Conclusions               Active disease surveillance and the ability to remotely monitor activities in peripheral health units are critical needs in many poor countries. Our results provide additional perspectives on the twin problem of surveillance and remote quality assessment.},

Only peer-reviewed cross-sectional articles from January 2000 until May 2018 focusing on treated water and groundwater in Malaysia were included in this review. Based on the inclusion criteria, 30 articles were selected which measures water quality parameters in drinking water. Overall pooled mean for physical parameters (pH, turbidity, total suspended solids, total dissolved solids, temperature and conductivity) were within the reference levels established by the Malaysian National Drinking Water Quality Standard. In this review, the generally low number of available studies which fulfil the inclusion criteria means that interpretation of results must be exercised with caution. This review may provide policy makers with reliable scientific evidences for better management practice and it is hoped that the findings will support the planning of future researches in this field.},

  abstract = {The electrochemical reduction of nitrate ions at a copper electrode in an unbuffered neutral aqueous solution is studied. Using a two compartment electrochemical cell, three stationary cathodic waves, noted P1, P2 and P3, were evidenced by cyclic voltammetry at −0.9, −1.2 and −1.3 V/SCE, respectively. By comparing the electrochemical response of nitrate and nitrite containing solutions, P1 was attributed to the reduction of nitrate to nitrite. In order to assign P2 and P3 features by determining the number of electrons involved at the corresponding potential, rotating disk electrode experiments at various rotation speeds, combined with linear sweep voltammetry, were performed. Current data analysis at a given potential was carried out using Koutecky–Levich treatment taking into account water reduction. Confident values of the diffusion coefficient D of nitrate ions were assessed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for nitrate concentrations of 10−3, 10−2 and 10−1 M. For a nitrate concentration of 10−2 M, D was found to be 1.31 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 allowing the number of electrons to be determined as 6 for P2 and 8 for P3, in accordance with nitrate reduction into hydroxylamine and ammonia, respectively. The formation of hydroxylamine was confirmed by the observation of its reoxidation at a Pt microelectrode present at the Cu electrode/nitrate solution interface.},

  abstract = {The water chemistry of selected rivers in Kota Marudu, Sabah was studied based on the major ion chemistry and its suitability for drinking and irrigation purposes. Ten sampling stations were selected and water samples were collected from each station to assess its chemical properties. The physico-chemical variables including temperature, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, turbidity, ammoniacal-nitrogen (NH3-N), biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total suspended solid (TSS) were measured. The cations (K, Mg, Ca, Na) were analyzed by ICP-MS. Most of the variables were within the drinking water quality standards stipulated by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Ministry of Health (MOH), Malaysia except for turbidity. Sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and salinity hazard were calculated to identify the suitability of the water as irrigation water. The Wilcox diagram classifies that only 10\% of samples are not suitable for the purpose of irrigation. The overall results showed that most of the rivers in Kota Marudu are still in a clean condition and suitable for drinking and irrigation purposes except for Sumbilingan River, which is considered as slightly polluted. The results are supported by the hierarchical cluster analysis as the stations were grouped into two groups; low and high pollution intensities. This preliminary result can update the baseline data of selected water quality parameters in the Kota Marudu and could serve as tool for assisting relevant government bodies in regulating the water resources policies in the future.},

We epitomize between 4 and 34 \% of all carcinogenic tissues are lacking because of weak, in adequate malignant/benign cancer tissue on the contrary. So, an effective alternative method is the valid concern in the field of medical right now. Imaging with the help of patch antenna to detect chronic disease like breast cancer, oxidative stress syndrome etc. it has been proved to be a suitable potential method, and there are many works in this area. All materials have different conductivity and permittivity. With the help of these antennas, a 3D tissue structure which has different conductivity and permittivity is modelled in highfrequency structure simulator through finite element method which resolves electromagnetic field values and a microstrip patch antenna operation process. As compared with conventional antennas, micro strip patch antennas have enhanced benefits and better prospects. An integrated Antenna plays an important or crucial role for supporting many applications in biomedical, commercial and in military fields. The Antenna designed for these applications should be wideband, not sensitive to the human body. In this present review, the precise application of the Antenna in different biomedical aspects is considered. Furthermore, the author has also discussed the analytical results using simulation models and experimental results for some of the significantdisease.},

However, small, localised outbreaks in certain regions still exist and could possess a huge threat to the public health if eradication measure is not initiated. This review discusses the progress of Salmonella detection approaches covering their basic principles, characteristics, applications, and performances. Conventional Salmonella detection is usually performed using a culture-based method, which is time-consuming, labour intensive, and unsuitable for on-site testing and high-throughput analysis. To date, there are many detection methods with a unique detection system available for Salmonella detection utilising immunological-based techniques, molecular-based techniques, mass spectrometry, spectroscopy, optical phenotyping, and biosensor methods. The electrochemical biosensor has growing interest in Salmonella detection mainly due to its excellent sensitivity, rapidity, and portability. The use of a highly specific bioreceptor, such as aptamers, and the application of nanomaterials are contributing factors to these excellent characteristics. Furthermore, insight on the types of biorecognition elements, the principles of electrochemical transduction elements, and the miniaturisation potential of electrochemical biosensors are discussed.},

The scattering matrix method using inductive calculation is used to determine the output signal’s intensities in the blood with and without presence of Salmonella. The change in refractive index due to the reaction of Salmonella bacteria with its applied antibody on the flagellin layer loaded on the sensing and detecting microresonator causes the increase in through and dropper port’s intensities of the output signal which leads to the detection of SB in blood. A shift in the output signal wavelength is observed with resolution of 0.01 nm. The change in intensity and  shift in wavelength is analyzed with respect to the change in the refractive index which contributes toward achieving an ultra-high sensitivity of 95,500 nm/RIU which is almost two orders higher than that of reported from single ring sensors and the limit of detection is in the order of 1 × 10−8 RIU. In applications, such a system can be employed for a high sensitive and fast detection of bacteria.},

Microfluidics, as an emerging technique, provides new approaches to precisely control fluidic conditions on small scales and collect data in high‐throughput and quantitative manners. In this review, the authors present the relevant applications of microfluidics to quantitative biology based on two major categories (channel‐based microfluidics and droplet‐based microfluidics), and their typical features. We also envision some other microfluidic techniques that may not be employed in quantitative biology right now, but have great potential in the near future.},

Measurements of time-dependent collection of 12 kilobase pair plasmid DNA onto microelectrodes by dielectrophoresis show significant reduction in the response as the frequency increases from 100 kHz to 20 MHz. Collection time profiles are quantitatively measured using fluorescence microscopy over the range 100 kHz to 5 MHz and are represented in terms of two parameters: the initial dielectrophoretic collection rate, and the initial to steady-state collection transition. Measured values for both parameters are consistent with trends in the frequency-dependent real part of the effective polarizability measured for the same plasmid DNA using dielectric spectroscopy. The experimentally measured parameters are qualitatively compared with trends predicted by theory that takes into account dielectrophoretic particle movement and diffusion. The differences between experiment and theory are discussed with suggested improvements to theoretical models, for example, including the effects of electrohydrodynamically driven fluid motion.},

  abstract = {In the past decade, 3D printing technologies have been adopted for the fabrication of microfluidic devices. Extrusionbased approaches including fused filament fabrication (FFF), jetting technologies including inkjet 3D printing, and vat photopolymerization techniques including stereolithography (SLA) and digital light projection (DLP) are the 3D printing methods most frequently adopted by the microfluidic community. Each printing technique has merits toward the fabrication of microfluidic devices. Inkjet printing offers a good selection of materials and multimaterial printing, and the large build space provides manufacturing throughput, while FFF offers a great selection of materials and multimaterial printing but at lower throughput compared to inkjet 3D printing. Technical and material developments adopted from adjacent research fields and developed by the microfluidic community underpin the printing of sub-100 μm enclosed microchannels by DLP, but challenges remain in multimaterial printing throughput. With the feasibility of 3D printed microfluidics established, we look ahead at trends in 3D printing to gain insights toward the future of this technology beyond the sole prism of being an alternative fabrication approach. A shift in emphasis from using 3D printing for prototyping, to mimic conventionally manufactured outputs, toward integrated approaches from a design perspective is critically developed.},

  abstract = {Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) in the past few years has been used to design gas sensors. EIS based gas sensing has been considered as an ultra-sensitive technique to identify and measure different toxic gases. Their sensing performance has been superior when compared to other conventional techniques. Impedance makes it possible to investigate the finer changes occurring on the surface of sensing layers leading to the identification of the target gases such as H               2               S. The measurements are carried out by scanning the electrode surface with a mixture of frequencies from 1 Hz to 10 MHz and recording the response as Nyquist and Bode plots. From these plots, the results can be used to elucidate the electrochemical phenomena. The acquired impedance data can be fitted into equivalent circuits and this is further modeled to obtain information about the interfacial phenomena like grain bulk resistance, grain boundary resistance, interface between electrode and sensing film resistance. These phenomena support the sensing of toxic gases from ppm - ppb level. This article focuses on impedance spectroscopy and its relevance to sensors, challenges in detecting toxic gases on the electrode surfaces prepared using semiconducting metal oxides, doped metal oxides and graphene based composites along with the research gaps, current innovations and future directions. EIS based gas sensors have high selectivity, sensitivity, reproducibility, long term stability and they also assist prediction of the electrochemical mechanisms for the analyte gases.},

  abstract = {This paper reports a droplet-based microfluidic device composed of patterned co-planar electrodes in an all-in-a-single-plate arrangement and coated with dielectric layers for electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) actuation of discrete droplets. The co-planar arrangement is preferred over conventional twoplate electrowetting devices because it provides simpler manufacturing process, reduced viscous drag, and easier liquid-handling procedures. These advantages lead to more versatile and efficient microfluidic devices capable of generating higher droplet speed and can incorporate various other droplet manipulation functions into the system for biological, sensing, and other microfluidic applications. We have designed, fabricated, and tested the devices using an insulating layer with materials having relatively high dielectric constant (SiO2) and compared the results with polymer coatings (Cytop) with low dielectric constant. Results show that the device with high dielectric layer generates more reproducible droplet transfer over a longer distance with a 25\% reduction in the actuation voltage with respect to the polymer coatings, leading to more energy efficient microfluidic applications. We can generate droplet speeds as high as 26 cm/s using materials with high dielectric constant such as SiO2.},

Digital microfluidics is gaining popularity in biological and biomedical applications due to its ability to manipulate discrete droplet volumes (nL–pL), which significantly reduces the need for a costly and precious biological and physiological sample volume and, thus, diagnostic time. Despite the importance of discrete droplet volume handling, the ability of continuous microfluidics to process larger sample volumes at a higher throughput cannot be easily reproduced by merely using droplets. To bridge this gap, in this work, parallel channels are formed and programmed to split into multiple droplets, while droplets are programmed to be split from one channel, transferred and merged into another channel. This programmable handling of channels and droplets combines the continuous and digital paradigms of microfluidics, showing the potential for a wider range of microfluidic functions to enable applications ranging from clinical diagnostics in resource-limited environments, to rapid system prototyping, to high throughput pharmaceutical applications.},

  abstract = {A variety of modern applications including soft robotics, prosthetics, and health monitoring devices that cover electronic skins (e‐skins), wearables as well as implants have been developed within the last two decades to bridge the gap between artificial and biological systems. During this development, high‐density integration of various sensing modalities into flexible electronic devices becomes vitally important to improve the perception and interaction of the human bodies and robotic appliances with external environment. As a key component in flexible electronics, the flexible thin‐film transistors (TFTs) have seen significant advances, allowing for building flexible active matrices. The flexible active matrices have been integrated with distributed arrays of sensing elements, enabling the detection of signals over a large area. The integration of sensors within pixels of flexible active matrices has brought the application scenarios to a higher level of sophistication with many advanced functionalities. Herein, recent progress in the active matrix flexible sensory systems is reviewed. The materials used to construct the semiconductor channels, the dielectric layers, and the flexible substrates for the active matrices are summarized. The pixel designs and fabrication strategies for the active matrix flexible sensory systems are briefly discussed. The applications of the flexible sensory systems are exemplified by reviewing pressure sensors, temperature sensors, photodetectors, magnetic sensors, and biosignal sensors. At the end, the recent development is summarized and the vision on the further advances of flexible active matrix sensory systems is provided.},

In order to integrate the IDC sensor on a labon-chip, it is often required to minimize and optimize the sensor for sensitive and efficient performance. However, the conventional numerical simulation approach is quite time-consuming. Therefore, an efficient analytical method is proposed herein, leading to accurate capacitance and conductance expressions of an arbitrary multilayer-structured IDC. The model is validated with practical measurements of a series of coplanar waveguide (CPW) structure-based IDCs. In addition, an accurate characterization function, which relates the IDC capacitance and conductance to the complex permittivity of a material loaded on the top of the IDC sensing area, is obtained. The characterization function shows good agreement with the finite-element method (FEM) simulation results, which demonstrates the capability of the IDC sensor in dielectric spectroscopy measurements of µL and even nL liquids.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this invited paper is to give readers a critical and comprehensive overview on how to extract dielectric properties of a bioliquid within a broad frequency range. Two sensors are used in the paper to characterize saline solutions by measuring the broadband complex permittivity. The two sensors are based on transmission line and interdigital electrodes designed for low- and high- frequency measurements, respectively, on the basis of the coplanar waveguide structure due to its convenience of fabrication and integration with microfluidic structures for liquid measurements. Different from traditional work where the finite element simulation method is used, the characterization theories of the two sensors are built based on a numerical modeling procedure, which can dramatically increase the device design efficiency, taking just a few seconds. Differently from the finite element method, the proposed numerical analysis utilizes a conformal mapping technique for both sensors. The characterization theories of the two sensors are validated by measuring de-ionized water. The platform is finally used to measure 0.1 and 0.5 mol/L saline solutions within a broadband frequency range going from 10 up to 50 GHz, with the repeatability error within 5\%.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Acoustophoretic microfluidic devices have been developed for accurate, label-free, contactless, and non-invasive manipulation of bioparticles in different biofluids. However, their widespread application is limited due to the need for the use of high quality microchannels made of materials with high specific acoustic impedances relative to the fluid (e.g., silicon or glass with small damping coefficient), manufactured by complex and expensive microfabrication processes. Soft polymers with a lower fabrication cost have been introduced to address the challenges of silicon- or glass-based acoustophoretic microfluidic systems. However, due to their small acoustic impedance, their efficacy for particle manipulation is shown to be limited. Here, we developed a new acoustophoretic microfluid system fabricated by a hybrid sound-hard (aluminum) and sound-soft (polydimethylsiloxane polymer) material. The performance of this hybrid device for manipulation of bead particles and cells was compared to the acoustophoretic devices made of acoustically hard materials. The results show that particles and cells in the hybrid material microchannel travel to a nodal plane with a much smaller energy density than conventional acoustic-hard devices but greater than polymeric microfluidic chips. Against conventional acoustic-hard chips, the nodal line in the hybrid microchannel could be easily tuned to be placed in an off-center position by changing the frequency, effective for particle separation from a host fluid in parallel flow stream models. It is also shown that the hybrid acoustophoretic device deals with smaller temperature rise which is safer for the actuation of bioparticles. This new device eliminates the limitations of each sound-soft and sound-hard materials in terms of cost, adjusting the position of nodal plane, temperature rise, fragility, production cost and disposability, making it desirable for developing the next generation of economically viable acoustophoretic products for ultrasound particle manipulation in bioengineering applications.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we describe the design, manufacturing, and characterization of a sensor array suitable for implementing wide broad band EIS for samples in aqueous solution on a microfluidic platform. Its wide-ranging capacity will allow the development of fluid characterization studies with results that are not possible to obtain in systems with a lower frequency range. The microfluidic system consists of four filling chambers and the fluid transport channels required for flushing and filling. At the bottom section of each chamber there is a gold-deposited electrode that allows electrical interaction with the sample. The chamber’s geometry, transport channels, and the electrodes were designed using an optimization process through multiphysics simulations. Then, different manufacturing processes were developed experimentally for SU8 and PDMS which allowed to carry out the implementation of the microfluidic system. An electrical communication interface was designed for the interconnection of the microfluidic system with the vector network analyzer (VNA). Then, the measurements required to obtain the behavior of each sensor were developed.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic (DMF) platforms have contributed immensely to the development of multifunctional lab-on-chip systems for performing complete sets of biological and analytical assays. Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) technology, due to its outstanding flexibility and integrability, has emerged as a promising candidate for such lab-on-chip applications. Triggered by an electrical stimulus, EWOD devices allow precise manipulation of single droplets along the designed electrode arrays without employing external pumps and valves, thereby enhancing the miniaturization and portability of the system towards transcending important laboratory assays in resource-limited settings. In recent years, the simple fabrication process and reprogrammable architecture of EWOD chips have led to their widespread applications in food safety analysis. Various EWOD devices have been developed for the quantitative monitoring of analytes such as food-borne pathogens, heavy metal ions, vitamins, and antioxidants, which are significant in food samples. In this paper, we reviewed the advances and developments in the design of EWOD systems for performing versatile functions starting from sample preparation to sample detection, enabling rapid and high-throughput food analysis.},

  abstract = {Electric field-based smart wetting manipulation is one of the extensively used techniques in modern surface science and engineering, especially in microfluidics and optofluidics applications. Liquid dielectrophoresis (LDEP) is a technique involving the manipulation of dielectric liquid motion via the polarization effect using a non-homogeneous electric field. The LDEP technique was mainly dedicated to the actuation of dielectric and aqueous liquids in microfluidics systems. Recently, a new concept called dielectrowetting was demonstrated by which the wettability of a dielectric liquid droplet can be reversibly manipulated via a highly localized LDEP force at the three-phase contact line of the droplet. Although dielectrowetting is principally very different from electrowetting on dielectrics (EWOD), it has the capability to spread a dielectric droplet into a thin liquid film with the application of sufficiently high voltage, overcoming the contact-angle saturation encountered in EWOD. The strength of dielectrowetting depends on the ratio of the penetration depth of the electric field inside the dielectric liquid and the difference between the dielectric constants of the liquid and its ambient medium. Since the introduction of the dielectrowetting technique, significant progress in the field encompassing various real-life applications was demonstrated in recent decades. In this paper, we review and discuss the governing forces and basic principles of LDEP, the mechanism of interface localization of LDEP for dielectrowetting, related phenomenon, and their recent applications, with an outlook on the future research.},

Herein, we report that the electrical properties relevant to electrowetting for a widely used dielectric, PDMS, can be substantially enhanced upon the incorporation of graphene oxide (GO) fillers into the PDMS polymer matrix. The GO-PDMS composite is characterized by higher values of the dielectric constant, higher breakdown electric field, and lower actuation voltages due to enhanced interfacial polarization. The improvement of these properties with the increase in concentration of GO, is explored till the ‘percolation threshold’. This newly developed composite as the dielectric, droplet actuation and electric field-induced droplet transportation over a fabricated triangular electrode system are performed. The results are compared with the literature data on PDMS and other dielectrics to establish the superior qualities of the dielectric for rapid transportation of droplets at significantly lower voltages with potential for new applications.},

While many of these effects are understood for specific, approximate models of the particles' interactions, there are a number of proposed force laws in the literature, especially for viscous interactions. We numerically measure the complex shear modulus               G               * of jammed packings for various viscous force laws that damp relative velocities between pairs of contacting particles or between a particle and the continuous fluid phase.

The configuration investigated allows for comparing the experimental results with respect to the predictions of Brochard’s theoretical model (Brochard in Langmuir 5:432–438, 1989). Firstly, side-view observations using stroboscopic recording techniques were used to measure and analyse droplet deformations as well as the front and rear apparent contact angles during motion. Secondly, the influence of viscosity on the droplet velocity as a function of the applied voltage was studied. This has revealed that low Reynolds number droplet motion can be described by the simple laminar viscous model of Brochard. Finally, the influence of the dielectric thickness on the droplet dynamics was studied. It is shown that droplet velocity is limited by a saturation effect of the driving electrostatic force and that this phenomenon is very similar to that occurring in static experiments.},

The HMS employed a three electrodes configuration architecture, while GO of various concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 mg/ml would serve as the sensing medium. The surface of the working electrode was decorated with GO through drop-casting technique. Several types of heavy metal ions such as lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and cadmium (Cd) were used in this study. The concentration of each was prepared according to the maximum exposure limit imposed by World Health Organization, with Pb (10 ppm), Hg (1 ppm), and Cd (5 ppm). The sensing performance was found to be proportionate to GO concentration when the sensor was exposed to 10 ppm of Pb. On selectivity test using 1 mg/ml of GO, the sensor exhibited superior sensitivity towards 10 ppm of Pb, \textasciitilde{} 1666.6\%; followed by 5 ppm of Cd, \textasciitilde 512.8\%, while 1 ppm of Hg being the least detected, \textasciitilde 10.5\%.

Rapid, reliable detection and identification of this pathogen in food and environmental sources is key to safeguarding the food supply. Traditional microbiological culture techniques have been the ‘gold standard’ for State and Federal regulators. Unfortunately, the time to result is too long to effectively monitor foodstuffs, especially those with very short shelf lives. Advances in traditional microbiology and molecular biology over the past 25 years have greatly improved the speed at which this pathogen is detected. Nonetheless, food and environmental samples possess a distinctive set of challenges for these newer, more rapid methodologies. Furthermore, more detailed identification and subtyping strategies still rely heavily on the availability of a pure isolate. However, major shifts in DNA sequencing technologies are meeting this challenge by advancing the detection, identification and subtyping of Salmonella towards a culture-independent diagnostic framework. This review will focus on current approaches and state-of-the-art next-generation advances in the detection, identification and subtyping of Salmonella from food and environmental sources.},

  abstract = {Digital (droplet) microfluidics (DµF) is a powerful platform for automated lab-on-a-chip procedures, ranging from quantitative bioassays such as RT-qPCR to complete mammalian cell culturing. The simple MEMS processing protocols typically employed to fabricate DµF devices limit their functionality to two dimensions, and hence constrain the applications for which these devices can be used. This paper describes the integration of vertical functionality into a DµF platform by stacking two planar digital microfluidic devices, altering the electrode fabrication process, and incorporating channels for reversibly translating droplets between layers. Vertical droplet movement was modeled to advance the device design, and three applications that were previously unachievable using a conventional format are demonstrated: (1) solutions of calcium dichloride and sodium alginate were vertically mixed to produce a hydrogel with a radially symmetric gradient in crosslink density; (2) a calcium alginate hydrogel was formed within the through-well to create a particle sieve for filtering suspensions passed from one layer to the next; and (3) a cell spheroid formed using an on-chip hanging-drop was retrieved for use in downstream processing. The general capability of vertically delivering droplets between multiple stacked levels represents a processing innovation that increases DµF functionality and has many potential applications.},

  abstract = {Increased use of digital microfluidic (DMF) biochips has fueled the replacement of expensive healthcare and biochemical laboratory procedures with low-cost, fully-automated, miniaturized integrated systems. Dilution and mixing of fluid samples in a certain ratio are two fundamental primitives needed in sample preparation, which is an essential component of almost all protocols. Most of the existing dilution algorithms used in droplet-based microfluidic systems deploy a sequence of (1 : 1) mix-split steps, where two unit volume droplets of different concentrations are mixed, followed by a balanced split operation to obtain two equal-sized droplets. In this work, we introduce a simulation-guided optimization procedure (SIMOP) for achieving the target concentrations while optimizing multiple factors according to user-specified priority levels. The SIMOP algorithm produces a given concentration while optimizing each criterion as desired. Experimental results favorably demonstrate the performance of the proposed procedure compared to many previous algorithms used for single-target dilution. We also study the impact of errors caused by unbalanced droplet splitting on the accuracy of target concentration obtained by SIMOP sequences. Experimental study reveals that SIMOP outperforms previous algorithms from the perspective of volumetric error management that may occur in reaction paths. The proposed technique may find many potential applications to robust sample preparation needed in diverse areas of biomedical engineering and healthcare domains.},

  abstract = {Significance             Microfluidic systems promise to improve the analysis and synthesis of materials, biological or otherwise, by lowering the required volume of fluid samples, offering a tightly controlled fluid-handling environment, and simultaneously integrating various chemical processes. To build these systems, designers depend on microfabrication techniques that restrict them to arranging their designs in two dimensions and completely fabricating their design in a single step. This study introduces modular, reconfigurable components containing fluidic and sensor elements adaptable to many different microfluidic circuits. These elements can be assembled to allow for 3D routing of channels. This assembly approach allows for the application of network analysis techniques like those used in classical electronic circuit design, facilitating the straightforward design of predictable flow systems.           ,              Microfluidic systems are rapidly becoming commonplace tools for high-precision materials synthesis, biochemical sample preparation, and biophysical analysis. Typically, microfluidic systems are constructed in monolithic form by means of microfabrication and, increasingly, by additive techniques. These methods restrict the design and assembly of truly complex systems by placing unnecessary emphasis on complete functional integration of operational elements in a planar environment. Here, we present a solution based on discrete elements that liberates designers to build large-scale microfluidic systems in three dimensions that are modular, diverse, and predictable by simple network analysis techniques. We develop a sample library of standardized components and connectors manufactured using stereolithography. We predict and validate the flow characteristics of these individual components to design and construct a tunable concentration gradient generator with a scalable number of parallel outputs. We show that these systems are rapidly reconfigurable by constructing three variations of a device for generating monodisperse microdroplets in two distinct size regimes and in a high-throughput mode by simple replacement of emulsifier subcircuits. Finally, we demonstrate the capability for active process monitoring by constructing an optical sensing element for detecting water droplets in a fluorocarbon stream and quantifying their size and frequency. By moving away from large-scale integration toward standardized discrete elements, we demonstrate the potential to reduce the practice of designing and assembling complex 3D microfluidic circuits to a methodology comparable to that found in the electronics industry.},

Significant research in this area has been related to the simulation and modeling of droplet motion, demonstration of different drop actuation techniques on laboratory-scale prototypes, and droplet routing and scheduling for more efficient assay procedures. This paper introduces the basics of the control analysis and design of a DMS, which is a relatively unexplored area in digital microfluidics. This paper starts with a discussion on a simplified dynamic model of droplet motion in a planar array of cells, and continues with more complicated dynamic models that are necessary to realize the structure of an appropriate closed-loop control system for the DMS. The control analysis and design includes both the transient and steady-state responses of the DMS under external driving forces. The proposed control analysis and design approach is implemented into SIMULINK® models to demonstrate the performance of the DMS through simulation using the system parameters previously reported in the literature.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) are now being extensively used to automate several biochemical laboratory protocols such as clinical analysis, point-of-care diagnostics, or DNA sequencing. In many biological assays, e.g., bacterial susceptibility tests and cellular response analysis, samples or reagents are required in multiple concentration (or dilution) factors, satisfying certain gradient patterns such as linear, exponential, or parabolic. Dilution gradients are traditionally prepared using continuous-flow microfluidic devices. Unfortunately, most of them suffer from inflexibility and non-programmability, and they require large volumes of costly stock-solutions. DMFBs, on the other hand, are shown to produce, more efficiently, samples with multiple dilution factors. However, none of the existing DMFBbased algorithms utilize the properties of the gradient-profile while optimizing reactant-cost and sample-preparation time. In this work, we explore the underlying combinatorial attributes of different gradients and harnessed them for efficient production of the desired concentration profile. For linear gradients, we present theoretical results concerning the number of mix-split operations and waste production, and prove an upper bound on on-chip storage requirement. A cost-effective method for generating a wide class of exponential gradients is also proposed. Finally, in order to handle a complex-shaped gradient, we posit a digitalgeometric technique to approximate it with a sequence of linear gradients. Experimental results on various gradient-profiles are presented in support of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic (DMF) biochips offer a versatile platform for implementing several laboratory based biochemical protocols. These tiny chips can electrically control the dynamics of nanoliter volume of discrete fluid droplets on an electrode array with desired actuation patterns. One important step in biochemical sample preparation is dilution, where the objective is to prepare a fluid with a desired concentration factor. Bioassays implemented on DMF biochips may require several different concentration values of the same sample. In this paper, we propose a scheme in which a set of different target droplets (target concentration values ranged between 0\% and 100\%) can be produced using 0\% concentration (buffer solution) and 100\% concentration (sample/reagent), with an error bounded above by 1 2n+1 , where concentration values are rounded-off by an n-bit binary fraction. Simulation results show that significant amount of savings in the number of mix-split steps and waste droplets can be achieved in comparison with the repeated use of existing single target based methods for generating multiple concentration factors.},

The prerequisite part of the investigation of droplet splitting is to understand the electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) based droplet actuation. This thesis demonstrates that not only the EWOD actuation is a self-feedback system - implying that the actuation force depends on the position of the droplet, but also the size of the droplet affects the magnitude of actuation force. However, a sensing mechanism is essential for complex operations, e.g. dispensing and splitting. One contribution of this thesis is a novel method of sensing the droplet position that requires connections to the two adjacent electrodes in the lower plate only.},

For a major class of DMFBs droplet actuation is depend on the rule of electrowetting-on-dielectric, where separate droplets of nano liter volume can be manipulated using 2D array of electrodes. Most important design automation issues in DMFBs is the concurrent routing of droplets inside a 2D array. The reason of droplet steering is needed to plan the movement of a number of droplets in a time synchronized mode within a 2D array while minimizing resource consumption and within optimum latest arrival time. The droplets may be classified as homogeneous or heterogeneous. In case of heterogeneous droplet routing, major issue is the avoidance of cross contamination where as for homogeneous droplet routing sharing of electrodes among different route paths for minimum resource utilization remains the main focus. In our paper, we put forward an algorithm for routing of heterogeneous droplet inDMFBs. We further developed a routing simulator that graphically displays detailed route performance for heterogeneous droplets within a predefined DMFB layout. We have used benchmark suite I and III to analysis our algorithm.},

In this paper, an innovative portable device for both quantitative and semiquantitative electrochemical analysis is presented. This device can operate autonomously without the need of relying on other devices (e.g., PC, tablets, or smartphones) thanks to built-in Wi-Fi connectivity. The developed hardware is integrated into a cloud-based platform, exploiting the cloud computational power to perform innovative algorithms for calibration (e.g., Machine Learning tools). Results and configurations can be accessed through a web page without the installation of dedicated APPs or software. The electrical input/output characteristic was measured with a dummy cell as a load, achieving excellent linearity. Furthermore, the device response to five different concentrations of potassium ferri/ferrocyanide redox probe was compared with a bench-top laboratory instrument. No difference in analytical sensitivity was found. Also, some examples of application-specific tests were set up to demonstrate the use in real-case scenarios. In addition, Support Vector Machine algorithm was applied to semi-quantitative analyses to classify the input samples into four classes, achieving an average accuracy of 98.23\%.

Important applications for silver‐based GDEs are the chlor‐alkali and the CO               2               electrolysis processes in which silver catalyzes the oxygen‐ or carbon dioxide reduction reaction. The wetting of the porous GDEs is of utmost importance for the achieved performance of the electrode: a completely dry electrode will result in low current densities due to the reduced active surface area while on the other hand, a completely flooded electrode will deteriorate the access of the gaseous reactant. Therefore, we investigated silver‐based GDEs for the oxygen reduction reaction with different amounts of the hydrophobic agent polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and analyzed the potential‐induced wetting behavior (electrowetting). The electrolyte breakthrough was recorded by a digital microscope and subsequently evaluated via imaging analysis of the observed breached electrolyte droplets. In order to characterize the wetting state during transition to the steady‐state, we applied electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements and retrieved the double‐layer capacitance. Our results indicate that a higher overvoltage facilitates the breakthrough of electrolytes through the gas‐diffusion electrode. Surprisingly, a faster breakthrough of electrolyte was observed for electrodes with higher PTFE content. Porometry measurements revealed that the GDE with low PTFE content has a monomodal pore size distribution, whereas electrodes with higher PTFE amount exhibit a bimodal pore size distribution. In GDEs with monomodal pore size distribution the time in which the double layer capacitance is leveling off correlates with the breakthrough time of the electrolyte. In summary, we emphasize that the wetting of GDEs is a complex interplay of the applied potential, electrode composition, and resulting porous structure which requires further advanced measurements and analysis considering the parameters affecting the wetting behavior as a whole.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to model the “macroscopic” functioning of droplet-based microfluidic networks, i.e., the speed and trajectory of droplets across a network of microfluidic elements. To this end, we first give a quick overview of microfluidic basics and main governing rules. Based on such principles, we derive mathematical models of the fundamental components of a microfluidic network and, then, we identify the set of variables that capture the dynamic state of the system. This allows us to define a simple way to simulate the “macroscopic” evolution of the microfluidic network, predicting the path followed by the droplets in the circuits. To validate the model, we compare the simulation results with the experimental outcomes we obtained from a simple but representative microfluidic circuit, which has been realized in our laboratory, and with other circuits tested in previous works. Finally, we apply our theoretical model to a more complex usecase, consisting in a microfluidic network with bus topology, and we draw some final considerations about the performance of such a network.},

While many force spectroscopy assays exist that allow probing of mechanics of bioparticles, most of them require immobilization of and direct contact with the particle and can only measure a single particle at a time. Here, we introduce quantitative acoustophoresis (QAP) as a simple alternative that uses an acoustic standing wave field to directly determine cellular compressibility and density of many cells simultaneously in a contact-free manner. First, using polymeric spheres of different sizes and materials, we verify that our assay data follow the standard acoustic theory with great accuracy. We furthermore verify that our technique not only is able to measure compressibilities of living cells but can also sense an artificial cytoskeleton inside a biomimetic vesicle. We finally provide a thorough discussion about the expected accuracy our approach provides. To conclude, we show that compared to existing methods, our QAP assay provides a simple yet powerful alternative to study the mechanics of biological and biomimetic particles.},

  abstract = {We present a highly efficient simulation method for the calculation of three-dimensional quasi-static interface shapes under the influence of electric fields. The method is especially useful for the simulation of microfluidic systems driven by electrowetting on dielectrics because it accounts automatically and inherently for the highly non-trivial interface shape in the vicinity of the triple-phase contact. In particular, the voltage independence of the local contact angle predicted based on analytical considerations is correctly reproduced in all our simulations. For the calculation of the shape of the interface, the geometry is triangulated and the mesh nodes are shifted until the system energy becomes minimal. The same mesh is also used to calculate the electric field using the boundary-element method. Therefore, only the surface of the geometry needs to be meshed, and no volume meshes are involved. The method can be used for the simulation of closed systems with a constant volume (e.g., droplet-based microfluidics) while preserving the volume very precisely as well as open systems (e.g., the liquid–air interface within micro-cavities or capillaries). Additional effects, such as the influence of gravitational forces, can easily be taken into account. In contrast to other efficient simulations, such as the volume-of-fluid, level-set, or phase-field methods, ideally, sharp interfaces are obtained. We calculate interface shapes for exemplary systems and compare with analytical as well as experimental results.},

  abstract = {Interfaces between a water droplet and a network of pillars produce eventually superhydrophobic, self-cleaning properties. Considering the surface fraction of the surface in interaction with water, it is possible to tune precisely the contact angle hysteresis (CAH) to low values, which is at the origin of the poor adhesion of water droplets, inducing their high mobility on such a surface. However, if one wants to move and position a droplet, the lower the CAH, the less precise will be the positioning on the surface. While rigid surfaces limit the possibilities of actuation, smart surfaces have been devised with which a stimulus can be used to trigger the displacement of a droplet. Light, electron beam, mechanical stimulation like vibration, or magnetism can be used to induce a displacement of droplets on surfaces and transfer them from one position to the targeted one. Among these methods, only few are reversible, leading to anisotropy-controlled orientation of the structured interface with water. Magnetically driven superhydrophobic surfaces are the most promising reprogramming surfaces that can lead to the control of wettability and droplet guidance.},

These were based on the fabrication of polyaniline nanoparticle films onto screen printed interdigitated electrodes using inkjet printing and their integration into a polymer microfabricated device with polytetrafluroethylene membrane and air flow path between the membrane and the sensor. Samples of ammonia in phosphate buffered saline of 52\>μL were measured using electrochemical impedance. While water vapour and ions from the buffer did result in a decrease in sensor impedance, this was eradicated by displacement of the headspace above the sensor with air. This, in combination with the adjustment of the sample to pH to 11 allowed the quantification of ammonia from 0 to 200\>μM with a limit of detection of 25\>μM. The device has the potential to be used for sensitive, low volume measurement applications of ammonia at point‐of‐test and point‐of‐care.},

Analysis is often restricted to estimating values of charge transfer resistances without interpretation and ignoring other electrical equivalent circuit components. In this article, the important basics of electrochemical impedance for electrochemical sensors and biosensors are presented, focussing on the necessary electrical circuit elements. This is followed by examples of its use in characterisation and in electroanalytical applications, at the same time demonstrating how fuller use can be made of the information obtained from complete modelling and analysis of the data in the spectra, the values of the circuit components and their physical meaning.

The interrogation involved two steps which were analyzed using various mathematical modeling techniques to determine the “goodness” of the sensor and to correct its output for small changes due to aging and environmental conditions. The first interrogation was a physical interrogation of the flow path into the sensor by supplying a driving force at the face of the sensor, either by exhaled human breath, or by acoustic sound pressure applied to diffusion barriers protecting the sensor, ensuring that the flow path was sufficiently open for detection of hazardous gases. The second interrogation was an electronic interrogation of the sensor itself, achieved by applying a small potential or current pulse to the working electrode of the sensor and deconvoluting its response to make small corrections to the sensor signal. These two steps provide periodic, real-time, and automatic surveillance and correction of AES, increasing robustness, reliability and accuracy, and user confidence, while decreasing calibration frequency, maintenance, and cost-of-ownership. Validation testing over sensors of various designs indicated a greater than 98\% reliability of the sensor/instrument interrogation technique.},

  abstract = {Background: The use of acoustic forces to manipulate particles or cells at the microfluidic scale (i.e. acoustophoresis), enables non-contact, label-free separation based on intrinsic cell properties such as size, density and compressibility. Acoustophoresis holds great promise as a cell separation technique in several research and clinical areas. However, it has been suggested that the force acting upon cells undergoing acoustophoresis may impact cell viability, proliferation or cell function via subtle phenotypic changes. If this were the case, it would suggest that the acoustophoresis method would be a less useful tool for many cell analysis applications as well as for cell therapy. Methods:We investigate, for the first time, several key aspects of cellular changes following acoustophoretic processing. We used two settings of ultrasonic actuation, one that is used for cell sorting (10 Vpp operating voltage) and one that is close to the maximum of what the system can generate (20 Vpp). We used microglial cells and assessed cell viability and proliferation, as well as the inflammatory response that is indicative of more subtle changes in cellular phenotype. Furthermore, we adapted a similar methodology to monitor the response of human prostate cancer cells to acoustophoretic processing. Lastly, we analyzed the respiratory properties of human leukocytes and thrombocytes to explore if acoustophoretic processing has adverse effects. Results:BV2 microglia were unaltered after acoustophoretic processing as measured by apoptosis and cell turnover assays as well as inflammatory cytokine response up to 48 h following acoustophoresis. Similarly, we found that acoustophoretic processing neither affected the cell viability of prostate cancer cells nor altered their prostate-specific antigen secretion following androgen receptor activation. Finally, human thrombocytes and leukocytes displayed unaltered mitochondrial respiratory function and integrity after acoustophoretic processing. Conclusion: We conclude that microchannel acoustophoresis can be used for effective continuous flow-based cell separation without affecting cell viability, proliferation, mitochondrial respiration or inflammatory status.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidics is a promising fluid processing technology used in lab-on-achip applications to perform chemical synthesis, particle filtration, immunoassays, and other biological protocols. Traditional digital microfluidic (DMF) devices consist of a 2D grid of coated electrodes over which droplets are manipulated. Selective activation of the electrodes results in an electrowetting effect that deforms the droplets and can move them around the electrode grid. More recently, electrowetting on dielectric has also been used to eject droplets and transfer them between opposing surfaces. This has given rise to new 3D DMF devices capable of more sophisticated routing patterns that can minimize crosscontamination between different biological reagents used during operation. A better understanding of electrowetting-induced droplet ejection is critical for the future development of efficient 3D DMF devices.},

  abstract = {Food and water contamination cause safety and health concerns to both animals and humans. Conventional methods for monitoring food and water contamination are often laborious and require highly skilled technicians to perform the measurements, making the quest for developing simpler and cost-effective techniques for rapid monitoring incessant. Since the pioneering works of Whitesides’ group from 2007, interest has been strong in the development and application of microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (µPADs) for food and water analysis, which allow easy, rapid and cost-effective point-of-need screening of the targets. This paper reviews recently reported µPADs that incorporate different detection methods such as colorimetric, electrochemical, fluorescence, chemiluminescence, and electrochemiluminescence techniques for food and water analysis.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) is one of the most versatile methods used to control the wettability of liquids using electrical input. In most applications, EWOD is applied using physical wiring, which may restrict its application to implantable EWOD devices. In order to resolve this issue, we have studied and developed a wirelessly powered EWOD by using planar coils at the receiver that are fabricated out of a printed circuit board (PCB) by means of standard micro photolithography. Unlike conventional, bulky, spool coil type, the planar coil type lends itself to compact design and easy integration with EWOD chips. The present wireless powering principle is based on magnetic induction, which is very efficient when the transmitter and receiver coils are close to each other. The voltage obtained at the receiver is much higher than typically required EWOD voltages ({$>$}50V) using a high transmission frequency (\textasciitilde MHz). The span of the EWOD contact angle is over 40°. In addition, amplitude modulation (AM) is implemented in the present wireless powering setup, followed by demodulation, in order to oscillate droplets at low frequency. This technique ensures smooth and reliable droplet movements. The wirelessly powered EWOD is used to transport a droplet and is mounted in a mini-boat which it powers and propels.},

In this study, we show that the rotation of linear aggregates of micro-particles can be achieved under the action of acoustic field pressure. This novel manipulation is investigated by tracking polystyrene beads of different sizes through the 3D imaging features of digital holography (DH). From our analysis it is understood that the positioning of the micro-particles and their aggregations are associated with the effect of bulk acoustic radiation forces. The observed rotation is instead found to be compatible with the presence of acoustic streaming patterns as evidenced by our modelling and the resulting numerical simulation. Furthermore, the rotation frequency is shown to depend on the input voltage applied on the acoustic device. Finally, we demonstrate that we can take full advantage of such rotation by combining it with quantitative phase imaging of DH for a significant lab-on-a-chip biomedical application. In fact, we demonstrate that it is possible to put in rotation a linear aggregate of erythrocytes and rely on holographic imaging to achieve a full phase-contrast tomography of the aforementioned aggregate.},

  abstract = {This study proposed a fabrication method for thin, film-based, transparent, and flexible digital microfluidic devices. A series of characterizations were also conducted with the fabricated digital microfluidic devices. For the device fabrication, the electrodes were patterned by laser ablation of 220 nm-thick indium tin oxide (ITO) layer on a 175 µm-thick polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate. The electrodes were insulated with a layer of 12 µm-thick polyethylene (PE) film as the dielectric layer, and finally, a surface treatment was conducted on PE film in order to enhance the hydrophobicity. The whole digital microfluidic device has a total thickness of less than 200 µm and is nearly transparent in the visible range. The droplet manipulation with the proposed digital microfluidic device was also achieved. In addition, a series of characterization studies were conducted as follows: the contact angles under different driving voltages, the leakage current density across the patterned electrodes, and the minimum driving voltage with different control algorithms and droplet volume were measured and discussed. The UV–VIS spectrum of the proposed digital microfluidic devices was also provided in order to verify the transparency of the fabricated device. Compared with conventional methods for the fabrication of digital microfluidic devices, which usually have opaque metal/carbon electrodes, the proposed transparent and flexible digital microfluidics could have significant advantages for the observation of the droplets on the digital microfluidic device, especially for colorimetric analysis using the digital microfluidic approach.},

Here, we present a digital acoustofluidic method to manipulate cell spheroids and organoids with unprecedented dexterity. By introducing localized vibrations via a C-shaped integrated digital transducer (IDT), we can generate a trapping node to immobilize cell spheroids with a diameter ranging from 20 μm to 300 μm. Moreover, we digitally trapped multiple cell spheroids atop of the C-shaped IDTs within a closed or open microfluidic chamber. By programming the trapping nodes within a 3 x 3 C-shaped IDT array, we can precisely position cell spheroids into designed patterns. We also demonstrated that our digital acoustofluidic device can accurately control the interaction of spheroid cells and organoids with excellent biocompatibility. Along with a simple fabrication and setup, our digital acoustofluidic method can provide precisely manipulate and position various cell spheroids or organoids in a contactless, label-free, and highly biocompatible manner.

  abstract = {Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) technology has been considered as a promising candidate for digital microfluidic (DMF) applications due to its outstanding flexibility and integrability. The dielectric layer with a hydrophobic surface is the key element of an EWOD device, determining its driving voltage, reliability, and lifetime. Hereby, inspired by the ionic-liquid-filled structuring polymer with high capacitance independent on thickness, namely ion gel (IG), we develop a polymer (P)-ion gelamorphous fluoropolymer, namely, PIGAF, composite film as a replaceable hydrophobic dielectric layer for fabrication of a high-efficiency and stable EWOD-DMF device at relatively low voltage. The results show that the proposed EWOD devices using the PIGAF-based dielectric layer can achieve a large contact angle (θ) change of ∼50° and excellent reversibility with a contact angle hysteresis of ≤5° at a relatively low voltage of 30 Vrms. More importantly, the EWOD actuation voltage did not change obviously with the PIGAF film thickness in the range of several to tens of microns, enabling the thickness of the film to be adjusted according to the demand within a certain range while keeping the actuation voltage low. An EWOD-DMF device can be prepared by simply stacking a PIGAF film onto a PCB board, demonstrating stable droplet actuation (motion) at 30 Vrms and 1 kHz as well as a maximum moving velocity of 69 mm/s at 140 Vrms and 1 kHz. The PIGAF film was highly stable and reliable, maintaining excellent EWOD performance after multiple droplet manipulations (≥50 cycles) or long-term storage of 1 year. The proposed EWOD-DMF device has been demonstrated for digital chemical reactions and biomedical sensing applications.},

In the presented system, the PDMS layer acts as both insulation and hydrophobic material. An electronic board controls all the signals needed for the actuation and sensing functionalities of the EWOD system. Sessile drop experiments show the saturation of the contact angle at negative bias voltage applied to the droplet. This behavior is ascribed to trapped carrier in the PDMS layer and explains the movement of the droplet toward the grounded electrode found in EWOD experiment. The procedure chosen for the drop movement achieves speed around 5cm/s with applied voltages around 200V. Detection of drop position is successfully achieved implementing the time-constant method, which evaluates the variation of electrode capacitance induced by the droplet presence on the PDMS surface corresponding to the metal electrode.},

Cellulose, and modified cellulose, has been used for centuries for making chemical measurements but devices made with this material traditionally suffered from either poor detection limits and/or limited ability to provide quantitative measurements. μPADs address these problems by patterning paper to create microfluidic channel networks that can direct flow to different regions of the device without the need for external pumps used in most traditional microfluidic devices. Furthermore, because the devices are made from cellulose or modified cellulose using inexpensive manufacturing methods, the devices can be inexpensive and disposable. The ability to carry out multiplexed analysis without external pumps using inexpensive, disposable devices makes μPADs ideal for point-of-care (POC) analysis. The interest in μPADs has led to a number of excellent comprehensive reviews in the field; in this review, we do not attempt to reference the entire field but instead seek to highlight major developments as well as areas that will be important for future development of this field.},

  abstract = {The outstanding versatility of graphene for surface functionalization has been exploited by its decoration with synthesized polypyrrole (PPy) nanoparticles (NPs). A green, facile, and easily scalable for mass production nanocomposite development was proposed, and the resulting PPy@Graphene was implemented in chemoresistive gas sensors able to detect trace levels of ammonia (NH3) under room-temperature conditions. Gas exposure for 5 min revealed that the presence of nanoparticles decorating graphene entail greater sensitivity (13-fold) in comparison to the bare graphene performance. Noteworthy, excellent repeatability (0.7\% of relative error) and a low limit of detection of 491 ppb were obtained, together with excellent longterm stability. Besides, an extensive material characterization was conducted, and vibration bands obtained via Raman spectroscopy confirmed the formation of PPy NPs, while X-ray spectroscopy (XPS) revealed the relative abundance of the different species, as polarons and bipolarons. Additionally, XPS analyses were conducted before and after NH3 exposure to assess the PPy aging and the changes induced in their physicochemical and electronic properties. Specifically, the gas sensor was tested during a 5-month period, demonstrating significant stability over time, since just a slight decrease (11\%) in the responses was registered. In summary, the present work reports for the first time the use of PPy NPs decorating graphene for gas-sensing purposes, revealing promising properties for the development of unattended gas-sensing networks for monitoring air quality.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is the movement of a particle in a non‐uniform electric field due to the interaction of the particle's dipole and spatial gradient of the electric field. DEP is a subtle solution to manipulate particles and cells at microscale due to its favorable scaling for the reduced size of the system. DEP has been utilized for many applications in microfluidic systems. In this review, a detailed analysis of the modeling of DEP‐based manipulation of the particles is provided, and the recent applications regarding the particle manipulation in microfluidic systems (mainly the published works between 2007 and 2010) are presented.},

  abstract = {In this study, acoustophoresis and dielectrophoresis are utilized in an integrated manner to combine the two different operations on a single polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chip in sequential manner, namely, particle wash (buffer exchange) and particle separation. In the washing step, particles are washed with buffer solution with low conductivity for dielectrophoretic based separation to avoid the adverse effects of Joule heating. Acoustic waves generated by piezoelectric material are utilized for washing, which creates standing waves along the whole width of the channel. Coupled electro-mechanical acoustic 3D multi-physics analysis showed that the position and orientation of the piezoelectric actuators are critical for successful operation. A unique mold is designed for the precise alignment of the piezoelectric materials and 3D side-wall electrodes for a highly reproducible fabrication. To achieve the throughput matching of acoustophoresis and dielectrophoresis in the integration, 3D side-wall electrodes are used. The integrated device is fabricated by PDMS molding. The mold of the integrated device is fabricated using high-precision mechanical machining. With a unique mold design, the placements of the two piezoelectric materials and the 3D sidewall electrodes are accomplished during the molding process. It is shown that the proposed device can handle the wash and dielectrophoretic separation successfully.},

  abstract = {Microfluidics-based biochips offer exciting possibilities for highthroughput sequencing, parallel immunoassays, blood chemistryfor clinical diagnostics, DNA sequencing, and environmental toxicity monitoring. The complexity of microfluidic devices is expected to become significant in the near future due to the need for multiple and concurrent biochemical assays on multifunctional and reconfigurable platforms. This paper presents early work on topdown system-level computer-aided design (CAD) tools for the synthesis, testing and reconfguration of microfluidic biochips. Synthesis tools map behavioral descriptions to a droplet-based microfluidic biochip and generate an optimized schedule of assay operations, the binding of assay operations to functional units, and the layout and droplet flow-paths. Cost-effective testing techniques lead to the detection of manufacturing defects and operational faults. Reconfiguration techniques, incorporated in these CAD tools, can easily bypass faults once they are detected. Thus the biochip user can concentrate on the development of the nano- and micro-scale bioassays, leaving assay optimization and implementation details to design automation tools.},

This article presents the characteristics of EWOD device with aluminum oxide (Al2O3, er \& 10) deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD), for the first time as the high-k dielectric for lowering the EWOD driving voltage substantially. The EWOD device of the single-plate configuration was fabricated by several steps for the control electrode array of 1 mm 9 1 mm squares with 50 lm space, the dielectric layer of 1,270 A˚ thick ALD Al2O3, the reference electrode of 20 lm wide line electrode, and the hydrophobic surface treatment by Teflon-AF coating, respectively. We observed the movement of a 2 ll water droplet in an air environment, applying a voltage between one of the control electrodes and the reference electrode in contact with the droplet. The droplet velocity exponentially depending on the applied voltage below 15 V was obtained. The measured threshold voltage to move the droplet was as low as 3 V which is the lowest voltage reported so far in the EWOD researches. This result opens a possibility of manipulating droplets, without any surfactant or oil treatment, at only a few volts by EWOD using ALD Al2O3 as the dielectric.},

  abstract = {The electrochemical reduction of nitrate and ammonium ion oxidation has been performed with the cathode (Al) and anode (Ti/RuO2) in the explosive industry wastewater polluted with a significant quantity of NO3− and NH4+. For this, the influences of various other cathode materials (Fe, Cu, and C), the current density (j = 35.71 to 142.86 A m−2), wastewater pH (pH = 3−12), and treatment time (t = 180 min) were analyzed for nitrate ion reduction, ammonium ion oxidation, nitrite ion generation, and total nitrogen (TN) degradation. The maximum nitrate removal and TN removal efficiencies were found to be ≈51 and ≈63\% at j = 142.86 A m−2 and wastewater natural pH after 180 min treatment time, respectively. In this condition, SEC was calculated to be 74.4 kWh (kg NO3− reduced)−1. The mechanistic analysis suggested that the atomic hydrogen molecules, H+, and e− help in the nitrate ion reduction and the available Cl− ion in the wastewater helps in the oxidation of the ammonium ion into gaseous nitrogen through the electrochemical process. The new and used electrodes were characterized by FE-SEM, AFM, and XRD techniques. Electrodes were also characterized within untreated and treated wastewater through CV and EIS analysis. The in situ generated oxidizing species were identified by the pnitrosodimethylaniline (RNO) bleaching test. Pseudo-first-order and nth-order kinetic models were applied, and the reaction rate was calculated to understand the reaction rate of the nitrate reduction. The approximate operational cost estimation has been performed for the lab-scale batch reactor treatment of the explosive industry wastewater. No scum or sludge was produced throughout the treatment process. This study helps to understand the parametric, mechanistic, and kinetic aspects of electrochemical nitrate reduction and oxidation of the previously present and produced ammonium ion in the explosive industry wastewater.},

The application of such microfluidic platforms is greatly increased in the area of biosensors geared towards point-of-care diagnostics. Together, the merger of microfluidics and biosensors has generated miniaturized devices for sample processing and sensitive detection with quantitation. We believe that microfluidic biosensors (biosensors-on-chip) are essential for developing robust and cost effective point-of-care diagnostics. This review is relevant to a variety of disciplines, such as medical science, clinical diagnostics, LOC technologies including MEMs/NEMs, and analytical science.

A numerical model accounting for sensor geometry, test-piece geometry and real permittivity, and metal electrode thickness has been developed to calculate the capacitance of the sensors when in contact with a planar test-piece comprising up to four layers. Compared with a disk-and-ring coplanar capacitive sensor developed previously, the interdigital configurations are predicted to have higher signal-to-noise ratio and better accuracy in materials characterization. The disk-and-ring configuration, on the other hand, possesses advantages such as deeper penetration depth and better immunity to lift-off variations.},

  abstract = {Water pollution seriously affects human health. Accurate and rapid detection and timely treatment of toxic substances in water are urgently needed. A stacked multilayer electrostatic printing technique was developed for making nanofiber-based microfluidic chips for water-quality testing. Nanofiber membrane matrix structures for microfluidic devices were fabricated by electrospinning. A hydrophobic barrier was then printed through electrostatic wax printing. This process was repeatedly performed to create three-dimensional nanofiber-based microfluidic analysis devices (3D-µNMADs). Flexible printing enabled one-step fabrication without the need for additional alignment or adhesive bonding. Practical applications of 3D-µNMADs include a colorimetric platform to quantitatively detect iron ion concentrations in water. There is also great potential for personalized point-of-care testing. Overall, the devices offer simple fabrication processes, flexible prototyping, potential for mass production, and multi-material integration.},

In this review, the recent research progress in microfluidic synthesis and bio-detection applications of QDs is discussed. The definitions of different QDs are first introduced, and the advances in microfluidic-based fabrication of quantum dots are summarized with a focus on perovskite QDs and carbon QDs.

This is due to its unique advantages such as simple and “power free” operation, easy assembly, great compatibility with auto control systems, and dual functionality of magnetic particles (actuation and target attachment). Over the past decades, magnetic DMF technique has gained a widespread attention in many fields such as sample‐to‐answer molecular diagnostics, immunoassays, cell assays, on‐demand chemical synthesis, and single‐cell manipulation. In the first part of this review, we summarised features of magnetic DMF. Then, we introduced the actuation mechanisms and fabrication of magnetic DMF. Furthermore, we discussed five main applications of magnetic DMF, namely drug screening, protein assays, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cell manipulation, and chemical analysis and synthesis. In the last part of the review, current challenges and limitations with magnetic DMF technique were discussed, such as biocompatibility, automation of microdroplet control systems, and microdroplet evaporation, with an eye on towards future development.},

  abstract = {The invention of microfluidic lab-on-a-chip alleviates the burden of traditional biochemical laboratory procedures which are often very expensive. Device miniaturization and increasing design complexity have mandated a shift in digital microfluidic lab-on-a-chip design from traditional manual design to computer-aided design (CAD) methodologies. As an important procedure in the lab-on-a-chip layout CAD, the lab-on-a-chip component placement determines the physical location and the starting time of each operation such that the overall completion time is minimized while satisfying nonoverlapping constraint, resource constraint, and scheduling constraint. In this paper, a multiscale variation-aware optimization technique based on integer linear programming is proposed for the lab-on-a-chip component placement. The simulation results demonstrate that without considering variations, our technique always satisfies the design constraints and largely outperforms the state-of-the-art approach, with up to 65.9\% reduction in completion time. When considering variations, the variation-unaware design has the average yield of 2\%, while our variation-aware technique always satisfies the yield constraint with only 7.7\% completion time increase.},

In this case, however, a highly sensitive on‐chip detection method is important for the monitoring of chemical reactions as well as for the detection of analytes inside the channel because the detection volume in a micrometer‐size channel is extremely small. Recently, a surface‐enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) technique is being regarded as a potential candidate for the highly sensitive detection of analytes in a microfluidic chip. This review provides a general survey and an in‐depth look at recent developments in SERS techniques for the biological/environmental analysis of minute analytes in a microfluidic chip.},

  abstract = {Electrical impedance biosensors are powerful and continuously being developed for various biological sensing applications. In this line, the sensitivity of impedance biosensors embedded with microfluidic technologies, such as sheath flow focusing, dielectrophoretic focusing, and interdigitated electrode arrays, can still be greatly improved. In particular, reagent consumption reduction and analysis time-shortening features can highly increase the analytical capabilities of such biosensors. Moreover, the reliability and efficiency of analyses are benefited by microfluidics-enabled automation. Through the use of mature microfluidic technology, complicated biological processes can be shrunk and integrated into a single microfluidic system (e.g., lab-on-a-chip or micro-total analysis systems). By incorporating electrical impedance biosensors, hand-held and bench-top microfluidic systems can be easily developed and operated by personnel without professional training. Furthermore, the impedance spectrum provides broad information regarding cell size, membrane capacitance, cytoplasmic conductivity, and cytoplasmic permittivity without the need for fluorescent labeling, magnetic modifications, or other cellular treatments. In this review article, a comprehensive summary of microfluidics-based impedance biosensors is presented. The structure of this article is based on the different substrate material categorizations. Moreover, the development trend of microfluidics-based impedance biosensors is discussed, along with difficulties and challenges that may be encountered in the future.},

The low voltage allows quick and accurate dispensing of droplets without dielectric breakdown. Nanoliter-sized (\textasciitilde 7.6-nL) butanol-styrene droplets were formed using 133 Vrms at 900 Hz. Microliter-sized oil droplets (\textasciitilde 0.6 to 10.5 μL) were formed using high voltage (460 to 672 Vrms at 100 Hz). Oil-water emulsions were formed and moved horizontally, overcoming frictional and surface tension forces. Large oil droplets were also moved to a wider electrode spacing, where the emulsion can take the spherical shape of a target. This was only achieved by transporting the emulsion down an inclined slope (45 deg) using gravity to augment the electric force. All the steps are in place to form targets from oil-water-oil and water-oil-water emulsions; only the dielectrophoretic centering and polymerization processes, which were demonstrated previously, must be added.},

  abstract = {Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) combine high electrical conductivity with high surface area and chemical stability, which makes them very promising for chemical sensing. While water quality monitoring has particularly strong societal and environmental impacts, a lot of critical sensing needs remain unmet by commercial technologies. In the present review, we show across 20 water monitoring analytes and 90 references that carbon nanotube-based electrochemical sensors, chemistors and field-effect transistors (chemFET) can meet these needs. A set of 126 additional references provide context and supporting information. After introducing water quality monitoring challenges, the general operation and fabrication principles of CNT water quality sensors are summarized. They are sorted by target analytes (pH, micronutrients and metal ions, nitrogen, hardness, dissolved oxygen, disinfectants, sulfur and miscellaneous) and compared in terms of performances (limit of detection, sensitivity and detection range) and functionalization strategies. For each analyte, the references with best performances are discussed. Overall, the most frequently investigated analytes are H+ (pH) and lead (with 18\% of references each), then cadmium (14\%) and nitrite (11\%). Micronutrients and toxic metals cover 40\% of all references. Electrochemical sensors (73\%) have been more investigated than chemistors (14\%) or FETs (12\%). Limits of detection in the ppt range have been reached, for instance Cu(II) detection with a liquid-gated chemFET using SWCNT functionalized with peptide-enhanced polyaniline or Pb(II) detection with stripping voltammetry using MWCNT functionalized with ionic liquid-dithizone based bucky-gel. The large majority of reports address functionalized CNTs (82\%) instead of pristine or carboxyl-functionalized CNTs. For analytes where comparison is possible, FETbased and electrochemical transduction yield better performances than chemistors (Cu(II), Hg(II), Ca(II), H2O2); non-functionalized CNTs may yield better performances than functionalized ones (Zn(II), pH and chlorine).},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a high-performance droplet router for digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) design. Due to recent advancements in bio-MEMS, the design complexity and the scale of a DMFB are expected to explode in near future, thus requiring strong support from CAD as in conventional VLSI design. Among multiple design stages of a DMFB, droplet routing which schedules the movement of each droplet in a time-multiplexed manner is a critical challenge due to high complexity as well as large impacts on performance. Our algorithm first routes a droplet with higher bypassibility which less likely blocks the movement of the others. When multiple droplets form a deadlock, our algorithm resolves it by backing off some droplets for concession. A final compaction step further enhances timing as well as fault-tolerance by tuning each droplet movement greedily. Experimental results on hard benchmarks show that our algorithm achieves over 35x and 20x better routability with comparable timing and fault-tolerance than the popular prioritized A* search [2] and the state-of-the-art network-flow based algorithm [18], respectively.},

This platform features (a) a 90 Pogo pin interface for digital microfluidic control, (b) an integrated (and motorized) photomultiplier tube for chemiluminescent detection, and (c) a magnetic lens assembly which focuses magnetic fields into a narrow region on the surface of the DMF device, facilitating up to eight simultaneous digital microfluidic magnetic separations. The new platform was used to implement a three-level full factorial design of experiments (DOE) optimization for thyroid-stimulating hormone immunoassays, varying (1) the analyte concentration, (2) the sample incubation time, and (3) the sample volume, resulting in an optimized protocol that reduced the detection limit and sample incubation time by up to 5-fold and 2-fold, respectively, relative to those from previous work. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a DOE optimization for immunoassays in a microfluidic system of any format. We propose that this new platform paves the way for a benchtop tool that is useful for implementing immunoassays in near-patient settings, including community hospitals, physicians’ offices, and small clinical laboratories.},

The results were in good agreement with the results of an image-based analysis, which was performed by using an electrolyte liquid (Na2SO4)/oil (n-decane) system with a surfactant (Tween® 80) to alter the interfacial tension. The maximum deviation of the contact angle and interfacial tension values determined using EWOD from the values determined using the image analysis were 2.8° and less than 1\,mN/m, respectively.},

  abstract = {The digital nucleic acid assay is a precise, sensitive, and reproducible method for determining the presence of individual target molecules separated in designated partitions; thus, this technique can be used for the nucleic acid detection. Here, we propose a multifunctional micropattern array capable of isolating individual target molecules into partitions and simultaneous on-site cell lysis to achieve a direct DNA extraction and digitized quantification thereof. The multifunctional micropattern array is fabricated by the deposition of a copolymer film, poly(2dimethylaminomethyl styrene-co-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pDH), directly on a microfluidic chip surface via the photoinitiated chemical vapor deposition process, followed by hydrophobic microcontact printing (μCP) to define each partition for the nucleic acid isolation. The pDH layer is a positively charged surface, which is desirable for the bacterial lysis and DNA capture, while showing exceptional water stability for more than 24 h. The hydrophobic μCP-treated pDH surface is stable under aqueous conditions at a high temperature (70 °C) for 1 h and enables the rapid and reliable formation of thousands of sessile microdroplets for the compartmentalization of an aqueous sample solution without involving bulky and costly microfluidic devices. By assembling the multifunctional micropattern array into the microfluidic chip, the isothermal amplification in each partition can detect DNA templates over a concentration range of 0.01−2 ng/μL. The untreated bacterial cells can also be directly compartmentalized via the microdroplet formation, followed by the on-site cell lysis and DNA capture on the compartmentalized pDH surface. For Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enteritidis, and Staphylococcus aureus cells, cell numbers ranging from 1.4 × 104 to 1.4 × 107 can be distinguished by using the multifunctional micropattern array, regardless of the cell type. The multifunctional micropattern array developed in this study provides a novel multifunctional compartmentalization method for rapid, simple, and accurate digital nucleic acid assays.},

This study investigates such enhancements via an openstructure design and a capacitive feedback system. It has a femto-farad level resolution and demonstrates a high operating speed (approximately 10 ms), effective ink dosing, and large color area change (approximately 92\%). The feedback system for the precise control of the color area is verified by testing under a wide range of interfacial tension. The system reduces the deviation of color contrast by 85\%. Working with high fidelity with large disturbances, which are represented by interfacial variations, the system shows robust performance against other disturbances, such as temperature variation and contact angle hysteresis.},

In this paper, we analyze the efficiency of a numerical lattice Boltzmann model to simulate basic transport operations of sub-millimeter liquid droplets in electrowetting actuated Hele-Shaw cells. We use a two-phase three-dimensional D3Q19 lattice Boltzmann scheme driven by a Shan–Chentype mesoscopic potential in order to simulate the gas–liquid equilibrium state of a liquid droplet confined between two solid plates. The contact angles at the liquid–solid–gas interface are simulated by taking into consideration the interaction between fluid particles and solid nodes. The electrodes are designed as regions of tunable wettability on the bottom plate and the contact angles adjusted by changing the interaction strength of the liquid with these regions. The transport velocities obtained with this approach are compared to predictions from analytical models and very good agreement is obtained.},

DMF devices open entirely new and promising pathways for multiplex analysis and reaction occurring in a miniaturized format, thus allowing for healthcare decentralization from major laboratories to point-of-care with accurate, robust and inexpensive molecular diagnostics. Here, we shall focus on DMF platforms specifically designed for nucleic acid amplification, which is key for molecular diagnostics of several diseases and conditions, from pathogen identification to cancer mutations detection.

  abstract = {Microfluidic-based platforms have become a hallmark for chemical and biological assays, empowering micro- and nano-reaction vessels. The fusion of microfluidic technologies (digital microfluidics, continuous-flow microfluidics, and droplet microfluidics, just to name a few) presents great potential for overcoming the inherent limitations of each approach, while also elevating their respective strengths. This work exploits the combination of digital microfluidics (DMF) and droplet microfluidics (DrMF) on a single substrate, where DMF enables droplet mixing and further acts as a controlled liquid supplier for a high-throughput nano-liter droplet generator. Droplet generation is performed at a flow-focusing region, operating on dual pressure: negative pressure applied to the aqueous phase and positive pressure applied to the oil phase. We evaluate the droplets produced with our hybrid DMF–DrMF devices in terms of droplet volume, speed, and production frequency and further compare them with standalone DrMF devices. Both types of devices enable customizable droplet production (various volumes and circulation speeds), yet hybrid DMF–DrMF devices yield more controlled droplet production while achieving throughputs that are similar to standalone DrMF devices. These hybrid devices enable the production of up to four droplets per second, which reach a maximum circulation speed close to 1540 µm/s and volumes as low as 0.5 nL.},

Here, we explore the thermal, structural, and electrical properties of Parylene C, and further present a variety of electronic devices featuring this polymer: transistors, capacitors, and digital microfluidic (DMF) devices. We evaluate transistors produced with Parylene C as a dielectric, substrate, and encapsulation layer, either semitransparent or fully transparent. Such transistors exhibit steep transfer curves and subthreshold slopes of 0.26 V/dec, negligible gate leak currents, and fair mobilities. Furthermore, we characterize MIM (metal–insulator–metal) structures with Parylene C as a dielectric and demonstrate the functionality of the polymer deposited in single and double layers under temperature and AC signal stimuli, mimicking the DMF stimuli. Applying temperature generally leads to a decrease in the capacitance of the dielectric layer, whereas applying an AC signal leads to an increase in said capacitance for double-layered Parylene C only. By applying the two stimuli, the capacitance seems to suffer from a balanced influence of both the separated stimuli. Lastly, we demonstrate that DMF devices with double-layered Parylene C allow for faster droplet motion and enable long nucleic acid amplification reactions.},

Other aspects of micro/nano acoustofluidics are examined: atomization, translation, mixing, jetting, and particle manipulation in the context of sessile drops and fluid mixing and pumping, particle manipulation, and formation of droplets in the context of closed channels, plus the most recent results at the nanoscale. These achievements will enable applications across the disciplines of chemistry, biology, medicine, energy, manufacturing, and we suspect a number of others yet unimagined.

  abstract = {Electrowetting refers to an electrostatically induced reduction in the contact angle of an electrically conductive liquid droplet on a surface. Most designs ground the droplet by either sandwiching the droplet with a grounding plate on top or by inserting a wire into the droplet. Washizu and others have developed systems capable of generating droplet motion without a top plate while allowing the droplet potential to float. In contrast to these designs, we demonstrate an electrowetting system in which the droplet can be electrically grounded from below using thin conductive lines on top of the dielectric layer. This alternative method of electrically grounding the droplet, which we refer to as groundingfrom-below, enables more robust droplet translation without requiring a top plate or wire. We present a concise electrical-energy analysis that accurately describes the distinction between grounded and nongrounded designs, the improvements in droplet motion, and the simplified control strategy associated with grounding-from-below designs. Electrowetting on a single planar surface offers flexibility for interfacing to liquidhandling instruments, utilizing droplet inertial dynamics to achieve enhanced mixing of two droplets upon coalescence, and increasing droplet translation speeds. In this paper, we present experimental results and a number of design issues associated with the grounding-frombelow approach.},

For example, ammonium is considered to be a quality indicator of natural waters as well as a potential biomarker of an enzymatic byproduct in key physiological reactions. Among the classical analytical methods used for the detection of ammonium ions, potentiometric ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) have attracted special attention in the scientific community because of their advantages such as cost-effectiveness, user-friendly features, and miniaturization ability, which facilitate easy portable measurements. Regarding the analytical performance, the key component of ISEs is the selective receptor, labelled as an ionophore in ISE jargon. Indeed, the preference of an ionophore for ammonium amongst other ions (               i.e.               , selectivity) is a factor that primarily dictates the limit of detection of the electrode when performing measurements in real samples. A careful assessment of the literature for the last 20 years reveals that nonactin is by far the most employed ammonium ionophore to date. Despite the remarkable cross-interference of potassium over the ammonium response of nonactin-based ISEs, analytical applications comprising water quality assessment, clinical tests in biological fluids, and sweat monitoring during sports practice have been successfully researched. Nevertheless, there is evident difficulty in the determination of close-to-micromolar levels of ammonium in real samples with a significant potassium background level (               i.e.               , millimolar concentration). This fact has fostered the search for a large variety of ammonium ionophores over the years, which are critically inspected herein. Overall, we provide an easily readable state of the art accompanied by a comprehensive description of other types of ammonium electrodes, including commercially available units. We conclude that newer breakthroughs are still required in the field to reach the desired analytical applications.},

Although many static and dynamic models focusing on droplet motion induced by electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) already exist, some dynamic features do not fit these models well, especially the dynamic saturation phenomenon. In this paper, a dynamic saturation model of droplet motion on the single-plate EWOD device is presented. The phenomenon that droplet velocity is limited by a dynamic saturation effect is precisely predicted. Based on this model, the relationship between droplet motion and device physics is extensively discussed. The static saturation phenomenon is treated with a double-layer capacitance electric model, and it is demonstrated as one critical factor determining the dynamics of droplet motion. This work presents the relationship between dynamics of electrowetting induced droplet motion and device physics including device structure, surface material and interface electronics, which helps to better understand electrowetting induced droplet motions and physics of digital microfluidics systems.},

  abstract = {Fast and reliable diagnoses are invaluable in clinical care. Samples (e.g., blood, urine, and saliva) are collected and analyzed for various biomarkers to quickly and sensitively assess disease progression, monitor response to treatment, and determine a patient’s prognosis. Processing conventional samples entails many manual time-consuming steps. Consequently, clinical specimens must be processed by skilled technicians before antigens or nucleic acids are detected, and these are often present at dilute concentrations. Recently, several automated microchip technologies have been developed that potentially offer many advantages over traditional bench-top extraction methods. The smaller length scales and more refined transport mechanisms that characterize these microfluidic devices enable faster and more efficient biomarker enrichment and extraction. Additionally, they can be designed to perform multiple tests or experimental steps on one integrated, automated platform. This review explores the current research on microfluidic methods of sample preparation that are designed to aid diagnosis, and covers a broad spectrum of extraction techniques and designs for various types of samples and analytes.},

Although a number of platforms have been specifically designed for the general public and are supported by a vast array of on‐line tutorials, this subject is not normally included in university chemistry curricula. Aiming to provide the basic concepts of hardware and software, this article is focused on the design and use of a simple module to control a series of PDMS‐based valves. The module is based on a low‐cost microprocessor (Teensy) and open‐source software (Arduino). The microvalves were fabricated using thin sheets of PDMS and patterned using CO               2               laser engraving, providing a simple and efficient way to fabricate devices without the traditional photolithographic process or facilities. Synchronization of valve control enabled the development of two simple devices to perform injection (1.6 ± 0.4 μL/stroke) and mixing of different solutions. Furthermore, a practical demonstration of the utility of this system for microscale chemical sample handling and analysis was achieved performing an on‐chip acid–base titration, followed by conductivity detection with an open‐source low‐cost detection system. Overall, the system provided a very reproducible (98\%) platform to perform fluid delivery at the microfluidic scale.},

But the miniaturization of the energy‐storage components is significantly limited by their energy density. Electrode materials with adequate electrochemical active surfaces are therefore required for improving performance. 2D materials with ultralarge specific surface areas offer a broad portfolio of the development of high‐performance micro‐supercapacitors in spite of their several critical drawbacks. An architecture engineering strategy is therefore developed to break these natural limits and maximize the significant advantages of these materials. Based on the approaches of phase transformation, intercalation, surface modification, material hybridization, and hierarchical structuration, 2D architectures with improved conductivity, enlarged specific surface, enhanced redox activity, as well as the unique synergetic effect exhibit great promise in the application of miniaturized supercapacitors with highly enhanced performance. Herein, the architecture engineering of emerging 2D materials beyond graphene toward optimizing the performance of micro‐supercapacitors is discussed, in order to promote the application of 2D architectures in miniaturized energy‐storage devices.},

The design of interdigital capacitor (IDCs) sensor is carried out in such a way that it would be suitable for microelectronic technology. The basic geometry of IDCs is defined by some parameters such as: number of electrodes N, electrode width W, electrode length L and the separation between electrodes G. The interactions between IDCs sensitive coating and analyte induced a change in the sensors capacitance due to the permittivity variation of the sensitive layer and to the change in polymer thickness (swelling). In this work, a fairly new approach of IDCs based sensor in terms of capacitance calculation has been presented. The results have been obtained from the modeling of the sensors geometry 2D and 3D using multi-physics simulation software COMSOL. The effects of some geometry parameters coupled with polymeric films swelling measurements have been studied.},

During droplet manipulation within an EWOD DMF device, the menisci of the droplets carry valuable information, including fluid properties, droplet size, position, and dynamics. Recognizing and analyzing these droplet menisci can provide insights into reaction kinetics and device defects, enabling reliable feedback control for improved device operation. To achieve reliable control of EWOD DMF devices, this study focuses on the recognition of droplet menisci using a deep learning approach. The U-Net model, a highly effective deep learning architecture for image segmentation tasks, is integrated into the present study. A convolutional neural network with the U-Net architecture is implemented, and image segmentation is performed to accurately identify droplet menisci. The network is trained using a diverse dataset containing images of droplet under various conditions. Model parameters are optimized to ensure high accuracy and robust performance. Experimental tests are conducted on images of droplets in different conditions, and the trained network successfully recognizes menisci with a model accuracy of 98 \%.},

Numerical solutions of the flow speed as a function of downstream position show excellent agreement with experiment. The only adjustable parameter is the inlet film height, which is controlled by the ratio of the reservoir pressure to the shear stress applied to the liquid stream. In the limiting cases where this ratio is either much smaller or much larger than unity, the rivulet speed shows a power law dependency on w, |dT/dx| and V.

  abstract = {Surface acoustic wave (SAW) is a well-proven tweezer serving various applications such as particle manipulation, cell trapping and separations, fluid mixing, and biosensing. SAWs can cause significant heat generation due to acoustothermal heating as established experimentally. Theoretical understanding of acoustothermal heating is limited, primarily due to the difficulties presented by multiple time scales inherent in this phenomenon. We present a theoretical model based on a multiple scale perturbation approach to solve the fluid flow and heat transfer equations for SAW-driven acoustothermal heating of a Newtonian fluid in a microchannel. The first order fields are oscillatory with the same frequency as that of the SAW, whereas the second order components are time-averaged to account for the mean flow and temperature fields. We find that the temperature rise depends solely on the acoustic energy density and its conversion into internal energy via pressure work on the fluid and hydrodynamic transportation of heat. For a fixed aspect ratio, an increase in system size essentially increases the conversion of acoustic energy into internal energy, leading to an increase in temperature rise. On the other hand, an increase in SAW frequency for a given system size causes the acoustic energy density to increase and thereby increases the temperature rise.

  abstract = {Seeking optimized infectious pathogen detection tools is of primary importance to lessen the spread of infections, allowing prompt medical attention for the infected. Among nucleic-acid-based sensing techniques, loop-mediated isothermal amplification is a promising method, as it provides rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of microbial and viral pathogens and has enormous potential to transform current point-of-care molecular diagnostics. In this review, the advances in LAMP-based point-of-care diagnostics assays developed during the past few years for rapid and sensitive detection of infectious pathogens are outlined. The numerous detection methods of LAMP-based biosensors are discussed in an end-point and real-time manner with ideal examples. We also summarize the trends in LAMP-on-a-chip modalities, such as classical microfluidic, paper-based, and digital LAMP, with their merits and limitations. Finally, we provide our opinion on the future improvement of on-chip LAMP methods. This review serves as an overview of recent breakthroughs in the LAMP approach and their potential for use in the diagnosis of existing and emerging diseases.},

Paper has micro-porous capillary-like networks which are responsible for flow of solvents instead of pumps or electronic power, making paper an ideally usable tool. Microfluidic paper-based analytical devices use fabricated paper devices on which hydrophilic zones are formed within hydrophobic barriers. Hydrophilic zones act as regions for actual analytical purposes, whereas hydrophobic zones act to demarcate separate zones from one another. Clinically, these devices have been proved to be excellent point-of-caredevices in diagnosis which can bypass use of costly and time-consuming laboratory techniques. In the presented review, the basic principles and components involved in the design of paper-based devices were then summarised in understandable manner. Further, various applications in different fields were also compiled in the form of text under different sections and tables. Paper-based analytical devices may serve as an excellent tool in variety of analytical works as these techniques are simple, rapid, economic, and require less human power or trainings.

Understanding of the electrostatic properties of digital microfluidics, like voltage distribution and capacitance is somewhat limited. Therefore, information about the exact applied voltage across test sample, its current position on the device is required for effective analysis. In this work voltage analysis will provide the behaviour of the voltage distribution around the droplet, while capacitance analysis will allow for the ability to indicate the current position of droplet and to identify the composition of the fluid.},

As the requisite voltage reduction is a key challenging design issues, to implement all the tasks using triangular electrodes that are possible in square electrode arrays as well, is a tedious job. Furthermore, to deal with this new design deploying triangular electrodes, we have analyzed all the necessary decisive factors including fluidic constraints to ensure safe droplet movements and other modular operations together with mixing and routing. Moreover, an algorithm has been developed to find a route for a given source and destination pair in this newly designed DMFB. Finally, we have included a comparative study between this new design and the existing one while encountering the above mentioned issues.},

  abstract = {Microfluidics-based biochips consist of microfluidic arrays on rigid substrates through which movement of fluids is tightly controlled to facilitate biological reactions. Biochips are soon expected to revolutionize biosensing, clinical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and drug discovery. Critical to the deployment of the biochips in such diverse areas is the dependability of these systems. Thus robust testing and diagnosis techniques are required to ensure adequate level of system dependability. Due to the underlying mixed technology and mixed energy domains, such biochips exhibit unique failure mechanisms and defects. In this article efficient parallel testing and diagnosis algorithms are presented that can detect and locate single as well as multiple faults in a microfluidic array without flooding the array, a problem that has hampered realistic implementation of several existing strategies. The fault diagnosis algorithms are well suited for built-in self-test that could drastically reduce the operating cost of microfluidic biochip. Also, the proposed alogirthms can be used both for testing and fault diagnosis during field operation as well as increasing yield during the manufacturing phase of the biochip. Furthermore, these algorithms can be applied to both online and offline testing and diagnosis. Analytical results suggest that these strategies that can be used to design highly dependable biochip systems.},

Various types of diagnosis procedures are performed on it through a sequence of modular operations like sample preparation, mixing, and detection. Mixing is the most important operation of DMFB as the outcome of the experiment is almost dominated by mixing. A good mixing of corresponding sample and reagent gives proper result while an improper mixing leads to erroneous result, which may be the reason to discard the assay. So, our objective is the betterment of mixing operation.

  abstract = {Digital microfluidics (DMF) is a platform that enables highly reconfigurable and automated fluidic operations using a generic device architecture. A unique hallmark of DMF is its “flexibility”: a generic device design can be used and reused for many different, divergent fluidic operations. The flexibility of DMF is compromised when devices are permanently modified with embedded sensors. Here we introduce a solution to the “flexibility gap” between fluidic operations in digital microfluidics and embedded sensors: “plug-n-play DMF” (PnP-DMF). In PnP-DMF, devices are designed to allow for rapid and seamless exchange of sensors depending on the application needs. This paper provides “proof of concept” for PnP-DMF using commercial biosensors for glucose and β-ketone, a custom paperbased electrochemical sensor for lactate, and a generic screen-printed electroanalytical cell. We demonstrate that hot-swapping sensors between experiments allows for convenient implementation of complex processes such as automated analysis of blood samples by standard addition. Finally, we explored the suitability for using PnP sensors in tandem with other sensing modalities, combining biosensor-based electrochemical measurement of glucose with a chemiluminescent magnetic bead-based sandwich immunoassay for insulin. The latter is notable, as it constitutes the first report of an analysis of different analytes in both the supernatant and precipitate from a single sample-aliquot in a microfluidic device. The results presented here highlight the versatility of PnP-DMF, illustrating how it may be useful for a wide range of applications in diagnostics and beyond.},

However, retrieval of individual magnetic beads from these arrays has not been realized until now despite having great potential for studying captured targets at the individual level. In this paper, optical tweezers were implemented on a digital microfluidic platform for accurate manipulation of single magnetic beads seeded in a microwell array. Successful optical trapping of magnetic beads was found to be dependent on Brownian motion of the beads, suggesting a 99\% chance of trapping a vibrating bead. A tailormade experimental design was used to screen the effect of bead type, ionic buffer strength, surfactant type, and concentration on the Brownian activity of beads in microwells. With the optimal conditions, the manipulation of magnetic beads was demonstrated by their trapping, retrieving, transporting, and repositioning to a desired microwell on the array. The presented platform combines the strengths of digital microfluidics, digital bioassays, and optical tweezers, resulting in a powerful dynamic microwell array system for single molecule and single cell studies.},

  abstract = {Since the Lab on a Chip concept was introduced in the 1990s, a lot of scientific advancements have occurred. However, large scale commercial realization of microfluidic technology is being prevented by the lack of standardization. There seems to be a gap between Lab on a Chip systems developed in the lab and those that are manufacturable on a large scale in a fab. In this paper, we propose a modular platform which makes use of standardized parts. Using this platform, a functional-based method of designing microfluidic systems is envisioned. To obtain a certain microfluidic function, a bottom-up design is made. This results in micro fluidic building blocks that perform a microfluidic function. This microfluidic building block is then stored in a library, ready for reuse in the future. Key characteristics are shown for several basic microfluidic building blocks, developed according to a footprint and interconnect standard by various players in the microfluidic world. Such a library of reusable and interoperable microfluidic building blocks is important to fill the gap between lab and fab, as it reduces the time-to-market by lowering prototype time cycles. The wide support of key European players active in microfluidics, which is shown by an ISO workshop agreement (IWA 23:2016), makes this approach more likely to succeed compared to earlier attempts in modular microfluidics.},

Acoustic radio frequency filters, for instance, are integral parts of wireless devices. SAWs in particular find applications in life sciences and microfluidics for sensing and mixing of tiny amounts of liquids. In addition to this continuously growing number of applications, SAWs are ideally suited to probe and control elementary excitations in condensed matter at the limit of single quantum excitations. Even collective excitations, classical or quantum are nowadays coherently interfaced by SAWs. This wide, highly diverse, interdisciplinary and continuously expanding spectrum literally unites advanced sensing and manipulation applications. Remarkably, SAW technology is inherently multiscale and spans from single atomic or nanoscopic units up even to the millimeter scale. The aim of this Roadmap is to present a snapshot of the present state of surface acoustic wave science and technology in 2019 and provide an opinion on the challenges and opportunities that the future holds from a group of renown experts, covering the interdisciplinary key areas, ranging from fundamental quantum effects to practical applications of acoustic devices in life science.},

To avoid extreme medical conditions of subjects, regular monitoring of their glucose levels has been suggested. The most common method that has been in use is the pinprick method for glucose monitoring which carries the risk of contamination as well as irritation. One possible approach called noninvasive technique can be adopted to avoid this major concern. This paper presents designing Inter-Digital-Sensor (IDS) for non-invasive sensing of the glucose level. The sensor-based chip once mounted onto the upper arm or pinkie finger of diabetes subject, is able to sense different glucose levels concentration as impedance plots. A set of several simulation results has been obtained using COMSOL for getting optimized dimensions of the sensor digits. This research has presented the generation of an electric field and intensity by using electrode of known length with element spacing varying from 250µm to 600µm developed over 15mm x 20mm sensor area. An ID of 475µm width spacing with ten (10) digits producing 2.33 pF of capacitance value with impedance resonating at 13 GHz of frequency is reported in this paper.},

  abstract = {The dominant forcing mechanism for particle manipulation using SSAW is shown to be spatially dependent when travelling components are considered.           ,              The use of ultrasonic fields to manipulate particles, cells and droplets has become widespread in lab on a chip (LOC) systems. There are two dominant actuation methods, the use of bulk acoustic waves (BAW) or surface acoustic waves (SAW). The development of BAW actuated systems have been underpinned by a robust understanding of the link between the ultrasonic field and forces which can be generated. In this work, we examine this link for standing surface acoustic waves (SSAW) comparing the relative strengths of streaming induced drag and acoustic radiation forces on suspended particles. To achieve this we have employed boundary conditions which accurately capture the travelling wave components of the pseudo-standing wave field, describe the key features of the acoustic radiation force fields and the acoustic streaming fields which can be generated, and finally we show that the relative importance of these two mechanisms is spatially dependant within a fluid chamber. The boundary condition used models the SSAW as two counter-propagating travelling waves, rather than assuming a standing wave directly. This allows the accurate inclusion of energy decay as the SAW couples into the fluid chamber and the resulting travelling wave component. This study shows that this previously neglected complexity of the SAW field is a critical factor in the nature of the resultant streaming field, as it gives rise to strong streaming rolls at the channel walls, which we validate experimentally. These rolls result in spatial variations of the dominant forces which in turn varies particle migration patterns spatially across the fluid domain.},

  abstract = {The statics of soft electrowetting is not affected by the viscoelasticity of the soft dielectric, but the dynamics is.           ,              Electrowetting is a commonly used tool to manipulate sessile drops on hydrophobic surfaces. By applying an external voltage over a liquid and a dielectric-coated surface, one achieves a reduction of the macroscopic contact angles for increasing voltage. The electrostatic forces all play out near the contact line, on a scale of the order of the thickness of the solid dielectric layer. Here we explore the case where the dielectric is a soft elastic layer, which deforms elastically under the effect of electrostatic and capillary forces. The wetting behaviour is quantified by measurements of the static and dynamic contact angles, complemented by confocal microscopy to reveal the elastic deformations. Even though the mechanics near the contact line is highly intricate, the macroscopic contact angles can be understood from global conservation laws in the spirit of Young–Lippmann. The key finding is that, while elasticity has no effect on the static electrowetting angle, the substrate's viscoelasticity completely dictates the spreading dynamics of electrowetting.},

In contrast, microfluidic chip-based technologies provide promising alternatives. The presence of environmental contaminants, especially bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens and their toxins, is creating a major public health problem. The detection of microbial communities in environmental samples is the first step to recognizing these organisms and insuring health and safety against their infection. This review addresses both the existing and innovative technologies for the detection of pathogens present in the environmental samples. First, impacts and challenges related to pathogens in the environmental samples are discussed, and standard techniques for their identification are addressed. Next, the microfluidic technologies are introduced as an alternative strategy with a particular focus on the detection of environmental contaminants. Challenges that still need to be overcome are also discussed. The review concludes with a section on paper-based microfluidic device and a discussion on future prospects.},

Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) exploits the dielectric properties of thin insulator films to enhance the charge density and hence boost the electrowetting effect. The presence of charges results in an electrically induced spreading of the droplet which permits purposeful manipulation across a hydrophobic surface. Here, we demonstrate EWOD-based protocol for sample processing and detection of four categories of antigens, using an automated surface actuation platform, via two variations of an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) methods. The ELISA is performed on magnetic beads with immobilized primary antibodies which can be selected to target a specific antigen. An antibody conjugated to HRP binds to the antigen and is mixed with H2O2/Luminol for quantification of the captured pathogens. Assay completion times of between 6 and 10 min were achieved, whilst minuscule volumes of reagents were utilized.},

Here, we demonstrate standing surface acoustic wave based “acoustic tweezers” that can trap and manipulate single microparticles, cells, and entire organisms (i.e.,               Caenorhabditis elegans               ) in a single-layer microfluidic chip. Our acoustic tweezers utilize the wide resonance band of chirped interdigital transducers to achieve real-time control of a standing surface acoustic wave field, which enables flexible manipulation of most known microparticles. The power density required by our acoustic device is significantly lower than its optical counterparts (10,000,000 times less than optical tweezers and 100 times less than optoelectronic tweezers), which renders the technique more biocompatible and amenable to miniaturization. Cell-viability tests were conducted to verify the tweezers’ compatibility with biological objects. With its advantages in biocompatibility, miniaturization, and versatility, the acoustic tweezers presented here will become a powerful tool for many disciplines of science and engineering.},

  abstract = {The use of acoustophoretic separation devices provides a feasible means in biomedical diagnostics for label-free separation of diseased cells. Separation via acoustophoresis, however, has been restricted mainly to size contrast. Thermally-assisted acoustophoresis, as a newly-developed approach, integrates acoustic and thermal actuators on the same platform, enabling a stiffness-based separation when adjusted properly. Using this method, we have demonstrated the possibility of separating cell-mimicking liposomes based on their membrane stiffness. In a temperature-tuned microchannel with an overlaid ultrasonic standing wave, the acoustic contrast factor of a liposome is mainly determined according to its compressibility compared to that of medium. The sign of this factor was observed to flip to a negative value at a specific temperature, unique to the composition of the liposome. This sign switch was hypothesized to be due to the thermotropic phase transitions in the liposome’s membrane upon which an apparent effect on the compressibility is experienced by the liposome. By choosing the midpoint of the existing temperature window for two different compositions, within which liposomes were mechanically distinct enough to become differentiable in the acoustic radiation field, we examined the separation efficiency under different flow rate conditions.},

  abstract = {Temperature is a critical—yet sometimes overlooked—parameter in microfluidics. Microfluidic devices can experience heating inside their channels during operation due to underlying physicochemical phenomena occurring therein. Such heating, whether required or not, must be monitored to ensure adequate device operation. Therefore, different techniques have been developed to measure and control temperature in microfluidic devices. In this contribution, the operating principles and applications of these techniques are reviewed. Temperature-monitoring instruments revised herein include thermocouples, thermistors, and custom-built temperature sensors. Of these, thermocouples exhibit the widest operating range; thermistors feature the highest accuracy; and custom-built temperature sensors demonstrate the best transduction. On the other hand, temperature control methods can be classified as external- or integrated-methods. Within the external methods, microheaters are shown to be the most adequate when working with biological samples, whereas Peltier elements are most useful in applications that require the development of temperature gradients. In contrast, integrated methods are based on chemical and physical properties, structural arrangements, which are characterized by their low fabrication cost and a wide range of applications. The potential integration of these platforms with the Internet of Things technology is discussed as a potential new trend in the field.},

  abstract = {Self-assembly is a process that operates over a vast range of length and time scales. Microfluidic technology has been proven to be a powerful tool to manipulate micro- and nano-scale substrates with precise control over size and speed using various fluidic materials and properties. In this review, we discuss the current status of microfluidic technology in manipulating fluid dynamics and interfacial phenomena which influence self-assembly process and resulted structures. The self-assembled materials/structures were summarized and discussed as the sequence of the objective size at the micro-, nano- and molecular scale. Overall, microfluidics is becoming a useful tool to manipulate various fluids regarding to physical and chemical properties, being inherently suitable for self-assembly process control.},

  abstract = {Most electroanalytical techniques require the precise control of the potentials in an electrochemical cell using a potentiostat. Commercial potentiostats function as “black boxes,” giving limited information about their circuitry and behaviour which can make development of new measurement techniques and integration with other instruments challenging. Recently, a number of lab-built potentiostats have emerged with various design goals including low manufacturing cost and field-portability, but notably lacking is an accessible potentiostat designed for general lab use, focusing on measurement quality combined with ease of use and versatility. To fill this gap, we introduce DStat (http://microfluidics.utoronto.ca/dstat), an open-source, general-purpose potentiostat for use alone or integrated with other instruments. DStat offers picoampere current measurement capabilities, a compact USB-powered design, and user-friendly cross-platform software. DStat is easy and inexpensive to build, may be modified freely, and achieves good performance at low current levels not accessible to other lab-built instruments. In head-to-head tests, DStat’s voltammetric measurements are much more sensitive than those of “CheapStat” (a popular open-source potentiostat described previously), and are comparable to those of a compact commercial “black box” potentiostat. Likewise, in head-to-head tests, DStat’s potentiometric precision is similar to that of a commercial pH meter. Most importantly, the versatility of DStat was demonstrated through integration with the open-source DropBot digital microfluidics platform. In sum, we propose that DStat is a valuable contribution to the “open source” movement in analytical science, which is allowing users to adapt their tools to their experiments rather than alter their experiments to be compatible with their tools.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidics (DMF) is an emerging technique for manipulating small volumes of liquids. DMF is particularly well suited for analytical applications as it allows automated handling of discrete samples, and it has been integrated with several inline analysis techniques. However, examples of the integration of DMF with electroanalytical methods are notably scarce, and those that have been reported rely on external electrodes that impose limitations on complexity. To combine the full capabilities of DMF with voltammetry, we designed a platform featuring a three-electrode electrochemical cell integrated in a microfabricated DMF device, removing the need for external electrodes and allowing for complete droplet control. The performance of the DMF/voltammetry system is comparable to that of a commercial screen printed electrode, and the new platform was applied to generating a calibration series for acetaminophen with a limit of detection of 76 μM and good precision (4\% average RSD), all with minimal human intervention. We propose that this platform and variations thereof may be a useful new tool for microscale electroanalysis and will be a complementary system to existing inline analysis techniques for DMF.},

  abstract = {Salmonella is a pathogenic bacterium capable of causing serious food-borne illness, which has caused worldwide concern. It can enter the food supply chain at various stages of production, distribution, and marketing. Due to its high prevalence, it is necessary to develop effective and efficient methods for the identification, detection, and monitoring of Salmonella at an early stage. While traditional detection technologies often have long detection times, complex operation and low sensitivity, emerging biosensor technologies combine novel nanomaterials with signal amplification methods to achieve improved performance. Biosensors show several advantages over traditional assays in terms of specificity, accuracy, and sensitivity and show superiority in rapid response. They are now seen as promising alternative tools since they are accessible and applicable approaches for rapid detection. In recent years, there has been a boom in the development of biosensors for the detection of foodborne Salmonella. This paper focuses on the comparison of new methods for the detection of optical and electrochemical biosensors in recent years, analyzes the different separation strategies and determination methods used, and provides an outlook on the future development of biosensors for the detection of Salmonella.},

This paper presents the design and development of a standalone, point-ofsource, portable, low-cost, automated and integrated microfluidic system for quick detection and quantification of nitrite. Based on multiphysics simulations, a disposable polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic device was employed to carry out the controlled Griess reaction based assay. A low-cost 3D printed syringe pump was developed to inject the sample and reagent. Photometric detection was employed using light emitting diode (LED) and photodiode. A transimpedance amplifier circuit was designed and fabricated to achieve amplified photodiode output with reduced noise. An off-the-shelf microprocessor was used to integrate the whole system and a smartphone application (app) was developed to control the complete system and store the data. Interaction between the application and the microprocessor was achieved using Bluetooth connectivity. Spectrophotometric validation was performed and a calibration equation was obtained which was used to convert the device voltage output to absorption, through specially programmed android app. All the components were integrated in a 3D printed platform whose virtues such as ease of usage and affordability makes, quantification of nitrite, a simple and real time process wherein the limit of detection and limit of quantification values are found to be 0.07103 ppm and 0.21524 ppm respectively with good repeatability.},

Soil health is determined by quantifying nutrients and physical parameters that are required to be in optimum range depending on the cropping pattern. In line with this, the current work presents an integrated, low-cost, microfluidic-based system for the detection of three such parameters namely – nitrite, pH and electrical conductivity (EC). A filtration protocol using different grades of Whatman filter paper was established to detect the said parameters using a suspension of soil. A multiplexed polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) device was designed and fabricated to test for EC and nitrite. The device employed a conductivity cell with copper electrodes, connected in series with a resistor, powered using an oscillating power source. Griess reaction-based photometric detection using an LED and photodiode was used to quantify nitrite. A transimpedance amplifier circuit was designed and fabricated to amplify the photodiode output. pH detection was achieved using a commercially available pH probe and an Arduino pH breakout board. A low-cost 3D printed syringe pump was developed to achieve flow control. Atmega 328P (onboard Arduino Uno) was used to integrate the subsystems. A smartphone application was built to control the system and store geotagged data. Bluetooth protocol was used to communicate between the smartphone application and Arduino. Standards and real soil samples were tested using the developed microfluidic system.},

A commercial inkjet-printed circuit board (PCB) printer was used to fabricate the IDEs on a glass substrate. The inkjet printer was optimized for printing IDEs on a glass substrate using a carbon ink with a specified viscosity. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in the frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz was employed for chemical sensing applications using an electrochemical workstation. The IDE sensors demonstrated good nitrite quantification abilities, detecting a low concentration of 1 ppm. Taste simulating chemicals were used to experimentally analyze the ability of the developed sensor to detect and quantify tastes as perceived by humans. The performance of the inkjet-printed IDE sensor was compared with that of the IDEs fabricated using maskless direct laser writing (DLW)-based photolithography. The DLW–photolithography-based fabrication approach produces IDE sensors with excellent geometric tolerances and better sensing performance. However, inkjet printing provides IDE sensors at a fraction of the cost and time. The inkjet printing-based IDE sensor, fabricated in under 2 min and costing less than USD 0.3, can be adapted as a suitable IDE sensor with rapid and scalable fabrication process capabilities.},

Droplet is actuated into unique behaviours depending on the applied SAW power. A wide range of droplet based applications have been employed utilizing these behaviours.

  abstract = {Background: Excessive collection of platelets is an unwanted side effect in current centrifugation-based peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) apheresis. We investigated a novel microchip-based acoustophoresis technique, utilizing ultrasonic standing wave forces for the removal of platelets from PBPC products. By applying an acoustic standing wave field onto a continuously flowing cell suspension in a micro channel, cells can be separated from the surrounding media depending on their physical properties. StudyDesignandMethods:PBPC samples were obtained from patients (n = 15) and healthy donors (n = 6) and sorted on an acoustophoresis-chip. The acoustic force was set to separate leukocytes from platelets into a target fraction and a waste fraction, respectively. The PBPC samples, the target and the waste fractions were analysed for cell recovery, purity and functionality. Results: The median separation efficiency of leukocytes to the target fraction was 98\% whereas platelets were effectively depleted by 89\%. PBPC samples and corresponding target fractions were similar in the percentage of CD34+ hematopoetic progenitor/stem cells as well as leukocyte/lymphocyte subset distributions. Median viability was 98\%, 98\% and 97\% in the PBPC samples, the target and the waste fractions, respectively. Results from hematopoietic progenitor cell assays indicated a preserved colony-forming ability post-sorting. Evaluation of platelet activation by P-selectin (CD62P) expression revealed a significant increase of CD62P+ platelets in the target (19\%) and waste fractions (20\%), respectively, compared to the PBPC input samples (9\%). However, activation was lower when compared to stored blood bank platelet concentrates (48\%). Conclusion: Acoustophoresis can be utilized to efficiently deplete PBPC samples of platelets, whilst preserving the target stem/progenitor cell and leukocyte cell populations, cell viability and progenitor cell colony-forming ability. Acoustophoresis is, thus, an interesting technology to improve current cell processing methods.},

Motivated by that, the design automation community has spent considerable efforts and proposed numerous methods on automating the design process for corresponding microfluidic devices. For many of them, however, it often remains unclear whether the (automatically) generated design indeed works as intended and/or satisfies its purpose. Simulations, e.g., based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can help here as they allow for studying the behavior of microfluidic devices without the need for actual fabrication. However, the setup and configuration of CFD simulations is timeconsuming and requires extensive expertise—some of the reasons why it is hardly utilized in the design automation community yet. In this work, we propose a workflow that improves upon this state of the art by automating intermediate steps and highlighting the parameters that are relevant to the specific use case. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed workflow for fluid mixing in channel-based microfluidics.},

  abstract = {The microfluidics approach allows not only the continuous production of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) but also an accurate reaction parameter control in their synthesis.           ,              Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly porous crystalline materials formed by the coordination of organic ligands with metal clusters. Despite the significant progress in their development over the last few years and their applications in various classic and emerging fields, the control of their shape and size remains a challenge, in particular the search for more efficient and environmentally friendly syntheses. In this context, the microfluidics approach allows not only the continuous production of MOFs but also an accurate reaction parameter control in their synthesis, representing a step towards intensification, versatility and scalability in the use of MOFs. Microfluidics also offers the possibility of synthesizing effective and defect free MOF-based hollow fiber membranes saving reactants as compared to conventional methods. This review is devoted to highlighting the multitude of synergies appearing when dealing with MOFs and microfluidics, not only in the bare synthesis of MOFs and their hierarchical structures but also when fabricating hollow fiber membranes with important applications in the separation field.},

  abstract = {Acoustophoresis has become a powerful tool to separate microparticles and cells, based on their material and biophysical properties, and is gaining popularity in clinical and biomedical research. One major application of acoustophoresis is to measure the compressibility of cells and small organisms, which is related to their contents. The cell compressibility can be extracted from the acoustic mobility, which is the main output of acoustic migration experiments, if the material properties and sizes of reference particles, the size of the cells, and the surrounding medium are known. Accurate methods to measure and calibrate the acoustic energy density in acoustophoresis systems are therefore critical. In this Perspective, polystyrene microparticles have become the most commonly used reference particles in acoustophoresis, due to their similar biophysical properties to cells. We utilized a two-step focusing method to measure the relative acoustic mobility of polystyrene beads of various sizes and colors and present a quantitative analysis of the variation in acousto-mechanical properties of polystyrene microparticles, showing a large spread in their material properties. A variation of more than 25\% between different particle types was found. Thus, care is required when relying on polystyrene particles as a reference when characterizing acoustofluidics systems or acousto-mechanical properties of cells.},

  abstract = {Detection of the presence, size and speed of microdroplets in microfluidic devices is presented using commercially available capacitive sensors which make the droplet based microfluidic systems scalable and inexpensive. Cross-contamination between the droplets is eliminated by introducing a passivation layer between the sensing electrodes and droplets. A simple T-junction generator is used to generate droplets in microchannels. Coplanar electrodes are used to form a capacitance through the microfluidic channel. The change in capacitance due to the presence of a droplet in the sensing area is detected and used to determine the size and speed of the droplet. The design of a single pair of electrodes is used to detect the presence of a droplet and the interdigital finger design is used to detect the size and speed of the droplet. An analytical model is developed to predict the detection signal and guide the experimental optimization of the sensor geometry. The measured droplet information is displayed through a Labview interface in real-time. The use of capacitance sensors to monitor droplet sorting at a T-junction is also presented. The discussions in this paper can be generalized to any droplet detection application and can serve as a guideline in sensor selection.},

This involved dispensing droplets from a reservoir, measuring the volume of both the droplet and the reservoir droplet and then returning the daughter droplet to the original reservoir. The repetition of this process over the course of several hundred iterations offers, for the first time, a long-term view of droplet dispensing in DMF devices. Results indicate that the ratio between the spacer thickness and the electrode size influences the reliability of droplet dispensing. In addition, when the separation between the plates is large, the volume of the reservoir greatly affects the reproducibility in the volume of the dispensed droplets, creating “reliability regimes.” We conclude that droplet dispensing exhibits superior reliability as inter-plate device spacing is decreased, and the daughter droplet volume is most consistent when the reservoir volume matches that of the reservoir electrode.},

  abstract = {When making a droplet flow device what material should you use? What fabrication methods are available and will surface treatments be required? This review offers a guide, with examples, to making robust droplet flow devices.           ,              Since the first reports two decades ago, droplet-based systems have emerged as a compelling tool for microbiological and (bio)chemical science, with droplet flow providing multiple advantages over standard single-phase microfluidics such as removal of Taylor dispersion, enhanced mixing, isolation of droplet contents from surfaces, and the ability to contain and address individual cells or biomolecules. Typically, a droplet microfluidic device is designed to produce droplets with well-defined sizes and compositions that flow through the device without interacting with channel walls. Successful droplet flow is fundamentally dependent on the microfluidic device – not only its geometry but moreover how the channel surfaces interact with the fluids. Here we summarise the materials and fabrication techniques required to make microfluidic devices that deliver controlled uniform droplet flow, looking not just at physical fabrication methods, but moreover how to select and modify surfaces to yield the required surface/fluid interactions. We describe the various materials, surface modification techniques, and channel geometry approaches that can be used, and give examples of the decision process when determining which material or method to use by describing the design process for five different devices with applications ranging from field-deployable chemical analysers to water-in-water droplet creation. Finally we consider how droplet microfluidic device fabrication is changing and will change in the future, and what challenges remain to be addressed in the field.},

  abstract = {A high degree of beam steering is demonstrated using an electrowetting-driven liquid prism. While prism devices have typically relied on complex and expensive laboratory setups, such as high-vacuum facilities for fabrication of dielectric layers, this work utilizes a simple dip-coating method to provide an ion gel layer as a dielectric, offering 2 or 3 orders higher specific capacitance (c ≈ 10\,μF/cm2) than that of conventional dielectrics. Analytical studies present the effects of liquid selection and arrangement on overall prism performance. For experimental demonstrations of high-performance beam steering, we not only selected two immiscible liquids of water and 1-bromonaphthalene (1-BN) oil which provide the large refractive index difference (nwater\,=\,1.33 and n1-BN\,=\,1.65 at λ\,=\,532\,nm) between them, but also utilized a double-stacked prism configuration which increases the number of interfaces for incoming light to be steered. At a prism apex angle of φ\,=\,27°, we were able to achieve significantly large beam steering of up to β\,=\,19.06°, which is the highest beam steering performance ever demonstrated using electrowetting technology.},

We developed a closed-form solution for the inverse problem of the thin-film evolution equation, allowing us to obtain the projection pattern required in order to achieve a desired topography. We experimentally implement the method using a computer controlled light projector, which illuminates any desired pattern onto the bottom of a fluidic chamber patterned with heat–absorbing metal pads. The resulting heat map induces surface tension gradients in the liquid–air interface, giving rise to thermocapillary flow that deforms the liquid surface. If a polymer is used for the liquid film, it can then be photocured to yield a solid device. Based on the inverse-problem solutions and using this system, we demonstrate the fabrication of several diffractive optical elements, including phase masks for extended depth of field imaging, and for three-dimensional localization microscopy. The entire process, from projection to solidification, is completed in less than five minutes, and yields a sub-nanometric surface quality without any post-processing.},

  abstract = {An ideal on-site chemical/biochemical analysis system must be inexpensive, sensitive, fully automated and integrated, reliable, and compatible with a broad range of samples. The advent of digital microfluidic lab-on-a-chip (LoC) technology offers such a detection system due to the advantages in portability, reduction of the volumes of the sample and reagents, faster analysis times, increased automation, low power consumption, compatibility with mass manufacturing, and high throughput. We describe progress towards integrating sample collection onto a digital microfluidic LoC that is a component of a cascade impactor device. The sample collection is performed by impacting airborne particles directly onto the surface ofthe chip. After the collection phase, the surface ofthe chip is washed with a micro-droplet of solvent. The droplet will be digitally directed across the impaction surface, dissolving sample constituents. Because ofthe very small droplet volume used for extraction ofthe sample from a wide collection area, the resulting solution is relatively concentrated and the analytes can be detected after a very short sampling time (1 mm) due to such pre-concentration. After the washing phase, the droplet is mixed with specific reagents that produce colored reaction products. The concentration of the analyte is quantitatively determined by measuring absorption at target wavelengths using a simple light emitting diode and photodiode setup. Specific applications include automatic measurements of major inorganic ions in aerosols, such as sulfate, nitrate and ammonium, with a time resolution of 1 mm and a detection limit of 30 ng/m3. We have already demonstrated the detection and quantification of nitroaromatic explosives without integrating the sample collection. Other applications being developed include airborne bioagent detection.},

  abstract = {This paper presents basic bubble manipulations, including transporting, splitting, and merging, by dielectrophoresis (DEP) in an oil environment. In our presented method, bubbles are placed between parallel plates in an oil medium of a low vapor pressure, which eliminates the possibility of changing the gaseous composition of the bubble caused by evaporation of the medium. DEP has been previously investigated to actuate dielectric droplets and is adopted here to drive the oil environment as well as the immersed bubbles between parallel plates. In our experiment, air bubbles of 0.3 l were successfully transported in a 20 cSt silicone oil medium between a 75 m-high parallel plate gap. In addition, 0.6 l air bubbles were successfully split into two 0.3 l air bubbles, and then merged again by DEP. These successful manipulations make digital gaseous lab-on-a-chip a reality.},

  abstract = {On-chip digital microfluidic flowmetry can be designed and incorporated into standard microfluidic devices for high-precision multiplexed microflow measurements.           ,                             The accurate monitoring and control of liquid flow at low flow rates have become increasingly important in contemporary biomedical research and industrial monitoring. Inspired by the drop-counting principle implemented in a clinical gravity drip, we propose a novel microfluidic flowmetry technology for polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based conventional microfluidic devices, known as a microfluidic digital meter-on-chip (DMC), to achieve on-chip and localized microflow measurements with ultrahigh precision and a wide tunable range. The DMC technology primarily relies on capillarity, unlike a gravity drip, to induce a characteristic interfacial droplet pinch-off process, from which digital microflowmetry devices can discretize continuous flow into countable transferred liquid units with consistent quantifiable volumes. Enabled by the passive discretization principle and optical transparency, the DMC device requires no external energy input or bulky control equipment, and a non-contact wireless optical detection scheme using a smartphone can be conveniently used as a readout module. Moreover, the DMC technology achieves an ultrahigh flow-to-frequency sensitivity (6.59 Hz (μL min               −1               )               −1               ) and resolution (droplet transfer volume down to 2.5 nL, nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than in previously reported work, resulting in ultralow flow rates of 1 μL min               −1               ). In addition, the flow rate measurement range covers up to 80 μL min               −1               and down to at least 150 nL min               −1               (over 100 times lower than reported similar digital flowmetry on the same time scale) using the current device configuration. Benefiting from its simple device architecture and adaptability, the versatile DMC technology can be seamlessly integrated with various microfluidic and nanofluidic devices for drug delivery and biochemical analysis, serving as a promising technology platform for next-generation highly demanding microflow measurements.},

Various analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction patterns, scanning electron micrograph, transmission electron microscope, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, UV–Vis absorption spectra and Fourier transform infrared spectra were used to determine the structure, composition and morphology of the as-prepared samples. It can be concluded that MnTMPyP cations were inserted into interlayer spacing of the [NbWO6]- nanosheets and arranged in an inclined single layer at 58°. The MnTMPyP/NbWO6 nanocomposites modified electrode exhibited excellent electro-catalytic oxidation activity toward nitrite in 0.2 mol L-1 and pH 7.0 phosphate buffer solution. Additionally, the oxidation peak current is proportional to the square root of scan rates, indicating that the redox reaction of nitrite is a typical diffusion-controlled process. Also, the sensitivity and detection limit for nitrite at the modified electrode was evaluated as 3.80 9 10-5 mol L-1 over a concentration range from 1.20 9 10-4 to 3.57 9 10-3 mol L-1 by using differential pulse voltammetry.},

There are various active and passive microfluidic particle manipulation techniques where Acoustophoresis is a powerful technique showing high cell viability. The use of disposable glass capillaries for acoustophoresis, instead of cleanroom fabricated glass-silicon chip can potentially bring down the cost factor substantially, aiding the realization of this technique for real-world diagnostic devices. Unlike available chips and capillary-based microfluidic devices, we report milliliter-scale platform able to accommodate 1ml of a sample for acoustophoresis based processing on a market available glass capillary. Although it is presented as a generic platform but as a demonstration we have shown that polystyrene suspending medium sample can be processed with trapping efficiency of 87\% and the up-concentration factor of 10 times in a flow through manner i.e., at 35µl/min. For stationary volume accommodation, this platform practically offers 50 times more sample handling capacity than most of the microfluidic setups. Furthermore, we have also shown that with diluted blood (0.6\%) in a flow-through manner, 82\% of the white blood cells (WBCs) per ml could be kept trapped. This milliliter platform could potentially be utilized for assisting in sample preparation, plasma separation as well as a flow-through immunoassay assay development for clinical diagnostic applications.},

This demonstration proves the concept that electrochemical sensors can be seamlessly integrated with sample preparation units in a digital microfluidic platform. More significantly, the successful on-chip fabrication of a sensor array indicates that sensors become reconfigurable and have longer lifetime in a digital microfluidic platform. The on-chip fabrication of ion-selective electrodes includes electroplating Ag followed by forming AgCl layer by chemical oxidation and depositing a thin layer of desired polymer-based ion selective membrane on one of the sensor electrodes. In this study, potassium ionophores work as potassium ion channels and make the membrane selective to potassium ions. This selectiveness results in the voltage difference across the membrane layer, which is correlated with potassium ion concentration. The calibration curve of the fabricated potassium-selective electrode demonstrates the slope of 58 mV/dec for potassium concentration in KCl sample solutions and shows good agreement with the ideal Nernstian response. The proposed sensor platform is an outstanding candidate for a portable home-use for continuous monitoring of ions thanks to its advantages such as easy automation of sample preparation and detection processes, elongated sensor lifetime, minimal membrane and sample consumption, and user-definable/ reconfigurable sensor array.},

They are usually used as single-rod measuring chains in different designs, which are manufactured using precision mechanical manufacturing and assembling technologies. The paper describes a microsystem technology approach for the fabrication of miniaturized electrochemical sensors. The ceramic HTCC (high-temperature co-fired ceramic) and LTCC (low-temperature co-fired ceramic) multilayer technology enables suitable processes for the manufacturing of robust and miniaturized sensor arrays with a high functional density. Design, manufacture, and electrochemical performance of the novel ceramic multilayer-based sensor array are presented in the paper using various examples. An adapted material and process development was carried out for the sensitive functional films. Special thick-film pastes for the detection of the pH value as well as NH4+, K+, Ca2+, and Cu2+ ion concentrations in aqueous solutions were developed. Ion-sensitive thick-film membranes were deposited on a ceramic multilayer sensor platform by means of screen-printing. All ISEs, integrated in the sensor array, showed suitable electrochemical performances including a very quick response (several seconds) combined with a high sensitivity (exhibiting Nernstian behaviour) in the tested measuring range. The obtained sensitivities were around 57\,mVper\>decade: for the pH sensor, 30\,mVper\>decade for calcium, 53\,mVper\>decade for potassium, and 57\,mVper\>decade for ammonium. Depending on the application, different sensitive electrodes on the ceramic sensor array can be combined as required.},

Additional components (such as heaters, centrifuges, mixers, etc.) are required in practical applications on DMF devices. In this paper, a DMF chip interconnection method based on electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) was proposed. An open modified slippery liquid-infused porous surface (SLIPS) membrane was used as the dielectric-hydrophobic layer material, which consisted of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane and silicone oil. Indium tin oxide (ITO) glass was used to manufacture the DMF chip. In order to test the relationship between the splicing gap and droplet moving, the effect of the different electrodes on/off time on the minimum driving voltage when the droplet crossed a splicing gap was investigated. Then, the effects of splicing gaps of different widths, splicing heights, and electrode misalignments were investigated, respectively. The experimental results showed that a driving voltage of 119 V was required for a droplet to cross a splicing gap width of 300 µm when the droplet volume was 10 µL and the electrode on/off time was 600 ms. At the same time, the droplet could climb a height difference of 150 µm with 145 V, and 141 V was required when the electrode misalignment was 1000 µm. Finally, the minimum voltage was not obviously changed, when the same volume droplet with different aqueous solutions crossed the splicing gap, and the droplet could cross different chip types. These splicing solutions show high potential for simultaneous detection of multiple components in human body fluids.},

  abstract = {As interdigitated array electrodes (IDAEs) become increasingly common in analytical systems for rapid characterization of samples, physical insight into locationspecific electrochemical performance and functionality of these IDAEs is vital. Such characterization can be performed through the use of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), which is a powerful noninvasive physical methodology for determining electrochemical and topographic characteristics of complex samples. Depth scan SECM imaging was performed for the generation of 2D current maps of an IDAE relative to an ultramicroelectrode (UME) position in the x−z plane. Hundreds of probe approach curves (PACs) and horizontal sweeps were obtained from one depth scan image by simply extracting vertical and horizontal cross-sectional lines. These experimental PACs and sweeps were further characterized through comparison with simulation generated curves through modeling of the experimental system. An UME approach to and horizontal sweep across asymmetric systems such as an IDAE were explored in this paper. Full 3D models of finite element analysis were developed for the above SECM system, providing a deeper understanding of the above PACs and horizontal sweeps by means of SECM feedback in correlation with local concentration profiles. Especially, the transition region of an IDAE, where conductive and insulating substrates meet, was extensively investigated in this work.},

The microfluidic platform implements the transport of fluids, meanwhile the electronic module is on charge of the activation, heating and the interface with the user. The impulsion is based on the combination between pressurized chambers and the valves that control the pass of fluid. In particular, in this paper, an example of application of the lab protocol is reported. The experiments show the behaviour of the whole system under the required specifications.

For the study of static problems that can be written in terms of minimization of an energy, a boundary integral method for the computation of charge density distributions is developed. We illustrate its use with the computation of static shapes of charged drops over a flat surface and under the influence of an external potential. For the study of dynamic problems, where drops can move over a solid substrate we develop a phase-field model. Such models replace the sharp interfaces between two fluids by a so-called diffuse interface. We illustrate the use of the phase-field model with the calculation of drops spreading and moving in an electrowetting system.},

We present a unique acoustophoretic concept for the contactless transport and handling of matter in air. Spatiotemporal modulation of the levitation acoustic field allows continuous planar transport and processing of multiple objects, from near-spherical (volume of 0.1–10 μL) to wire-like, without being limited by the acoustic wavelength. The independence of the handling principle from special material properties (magnetic, optical, or electrical) is illustrated with a wide palette of application experiments, such as contactless droplet coalescence and mixing, solid–liquid encapsulation, absorption, dissolution, and DNA transfection. More than a century after the pioneering work of Lord Rayleigh on acoustic radiation pressure, a path-breaking concept is proposed to harvest the significant benefits of acoustic levitation in air.},

However, common approaches, such as inkjet or electrohydrodynamic printing, are well suited only for materials with low viscosity or specific electromagnetic properties, respectively. While in-air acoustophoretic forces are material-independent, they are typically weak and have yet to be harnessed for printing materials. We introduce an acoustophoretic printing method that enables drop-on-demand patterning of a broad range of soft materials, including Newtonian fluids, whose viscosities span more than four orders of magnitude (0.5 to 25,000 mPa·s) and yield stress fluids (τ               0               {$>$} 50 Pa). By exploiting the acoustic properties of a subwavelength Fabry-Perot resonator, we have generated an accurate, highly localized acoustophoretic force that can exceed the gravitational force by two orders of magnitude to eject microliter-to-nanoliter volume droplets. The versatility of acoustophoretic printing is demonstrated by patterning food, optical resins, liquid metals, and cell-laden biological matrices in desired motifs.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with microfluidic studies for lab-on-a-chip development. The first goal was to develop microsystems immediately usable by biologists for complex protocol integrations. All fluid operations are performed on nano-liter droplet independently handled solely by electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) actuation. A bottom-up architecture was used for chip design due to the development and validation of elementary fluidic designs, which are then assembled. This approach speeds up development and industrialization while minimizing the effort in designing and simplifying chip-fluidic programming. Dispensing reproducibility for 64 nl droplets obtained a CV below 3\% and mixing time was only a few seconds. Ease of the integration was demonstrated by performing on chip serial dilutions of 2.8-folds, four times. The second part of this paper concerns the development of new innovative fluidic functions in order to extend EWOD-actuated digital fluidics’ capabilities. Experiments of particle dispensing by EWOD droplet handling are reported. Finally, work is shown concerning the coupling of EWOD actuation and magnetic fields for magnetic bead manipulation.},

  abstract = {This work develops a technology for actuating droplets of any size without the requirement for high voltages or active control systems, which are typically found in competitive systems. The droplet actuation relies on two microelectrodes separated by a variable gap distance to generate an electrostatic gradient. The physical mechanism for the droplet motion is a combination of liquid dielectrophoresis and electrowetting. Investigating the system behavior as a function of the driving frequency identified the relative contribution of these two mechanisms and the optimum operating conditions. A fixed signal frequency of 0.5 kHz actuated various liquids and contaminants. Droplet actuation was demonstrated on several platforms, including linear, radial-symmetric, and bilateral-symmetric droplet motion. The electrode designs are scalable and can be fabricated on a flexible and optically transparent substrate: these key advancements will enable consumer applications that were previously inaccessible. A self-cleaning platform was also tested under laboratory conditions and on the road. This technology has significant potential in microfluidics and self-cleaning platforms, for example, in the automotive sector to clean body parts, camera covers, and sensors.},

  abstract = {Biosensors are powerful analytical devices that detect and quantify target analytes in a sample. Due to their high selectivity and sensitivity, enzymes, proteins, antibodies, peptides, and whole cells are commonly used as sensing elements in biosensors. However, the design and optimization of biosensors can be challenging due to the complexity of these biomolecules and their interactions with target analytes. In recent years, computational methods have emerged as powerful tools for designing and optimizing biosensors, enabling researchers to predict the behavior of biomolecules and their interactions with target analytes. Computational fluid mechanics can aid in the design of microfluidic systems for biosensing applications. In contrast, molecular dynamic simulation, molecular docking, quantum mechanics, and virtual screening methods can be used to predict the behavior of biomolecules at the atomic level and study the binding kinetics and thermodynamics of interactions. This paper critically discusses the use of computational methods in biosensors, focusing on enzyme-based, protein-based, antibody-based, peptide-based, and whole-cell-based biosensors. We also review using computational fluid mechanics, molecular dynamic simulation, molecular docking, quantum mechanics, and virtual screening methods in biosensor design and optimization. Additionally, we discuss the applications of these computational methods and biosensors in healthcare, environmental monitoring, food safety, biodefense, and security.

  abstract = {Rapid prototyping is a critical step in the product development cycle of miniaturized chemical and bioanalytical devices, often categorized as lab-on-a-chip devices, biosensors, and micro-total analysis systems.           ,              Rapid prototyping is a critical step in the product development cycle of miniaturized chemical and bioanalytical devices, often categorized as lab-on-a-chip devices, biosensors, and micro-total analysis systems. While high throughput manufacturing methods are often preferred for large-volume production, rapid prototyping is necessary for demonstrating and predicting the performance of a device and performing field testing and validation before translating a product from research and development to large volume production. Choosing a specific rapid prototyping method involves considering device design requirements in terms of minimum feature sizes, mechanical stability, thermal and chemical resistance, and optical and electrical properties. A rapid prototyping method is then selected by making engineering trade-off decisions between the suitability of the method in meeting the design specifications and manufacturing metrics such as speed, cost, precision, and potential for scale up. In this review article, we review four categories of rapid prototyping methods that are applicable to developing miniaturized bioanalytical devices, single step, mask and deposit, mask and etch, and mask-free assembly, and we will focus on the trade-offs that need to be made when selecting a particular rapid prototyping method. The focus of the review article will be on the development of systems having a specific arrangement of conductive or semiconductive materials.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Over the past decade, dielectrophoresis (DEP) has evolved into a powerful, robust and flexible method for cellular characterization, manipulation, separation and cell patterning. It is a field with widely varying disciplines, as it is quite common to see DEP integrated with a host of applications including microfluidics, impedance spectroscopy, tissue engineering, real‐time PCR, immunoassays, stem‐cell characterization, gene transfection and electroporation, just to name a few. The field is finally at the point where analytical and numerical polarization models can be used to adequately describe and characterize the dielectrophoretic behavior of cells, and there is ever increasing evidence demonstrating that electric fields can safely be used to manipulate cells without harm. As such, DEP is slowly making its way into the biological sciences. Today, DEP is being used to manipulate individual cells to specific regions of space for single‐cell assays. DEP is able to separate rare cells from a heterogeneous cell suspension, where isolated cells can then be characterized and dynamically studied using nothing more than electric fields. However, there is need for a critical report to integrate the many new features of DEP for cellular applications. Here, a review of the basic theory and current applications of DEP, specifically for cells, is presented.},

Conducting polymer hydrogels seem to be a very promising materials, since they present many of the necessary properties to be used as biosensors. Furthermore, their properties can be shaped and enhanced by designing conductive polymer hydrogel-based composites with more specific functionalities depending on the end application.

A thin layer doped with basic dyes is coated on the optical fiber for sensing by using the sol-gel method. The thicknesses of sol-gel layers, which play a key role in the sensitivity of the LPFG sensor, were carefully studied. Experimental results show that LPFG with a functional layer of ∼340 nm has the best sensing performance, and the detection limit is 0.08 ppm. The response time of the sensor is less than one minute, and the sensor has good repeatability with a short recovery time. Compared with other organic molecules and ions in water, the proposed LPFG sensor has not only good reusability, but also selectivity for the detection of ammonia.},

  abstract = {Microfluidic separation technology has garnered significant attention over the past decade where particles are being separated at a micro/nanoscale in a rapid, low-cost, and simple manner. Amongst a myriad of separation technologies that have emerged thus far, acoustic microfluidic separation techniques are extremely apt to applications involving biological samples attributed to various advantages, including high controllability, biocompatibility, and non-invasive, label-free features. With that being said, downsides such as low throughput and dependence on external equipment still impede successful commercialization from laboratory-based prototypes. Here, we present a comprehensive review of recent advances in acoustic microfluidic separation techniques, along with exemplary applications. Specifically, an inclusive overview of fundamental theory and background is presented, then two sets of mechanisms underlying acoustic separation, bulk acoustic wave and surface acoustic wave, are introduced and discussed. Upon these summaries, we present a variety of applications based on acoustic separation. The primary focus is given to those associated with biological samples such as blood cells, cancer cells, proteins, bacteria, viruses, and DNA/RNA. Finally, we highlight the benefits and challenges behind burgeoning developments in the field and discuss the future perspectives and an outlook towards robust, integrated, and commercialized devices based on acoustic microfluidic separation.},

Herein, we report an acoustically‐propelled, magnetic‐guided, erythrocyte‐mimicking hemoglobin micromotor with oxygen‐carrying capability. These hemoglobin micromotors were fabricated by encapsulating magnetic nanoparticles in hybrid hemoglobin/calcium carbonate microparticles, followed by covalently layer‐by‐layer assembly of hemoglobin multilayers. The asymmetric distribution of magnetic nanoparticles enables these micromotors to move rapidly under the propulsion of an acoustic field. The velocity of acoustophoretic motion of hemoglobin micromotors increases with the increase of input voltage of acoustic field, up to 58.2 μm·s               –1               at 10 V. The hemoglobin micromotors are directionally navigated by applying an external magnetic field, and also could pass through microchannels toward the targeted region. Moreover, such hemoglobin micromotors show effective oxygen loading and releasing capability, holding considerable promise as a new platform for oxygen delivery applications.},

Detailed mathematical discussion shows that threshold force for mobilization is a function of droplet size and liquid parameters, and droplet velocity after depinning is a function of applied thermal gradient, droplet size and liquid parameters. The device with Ti as micro-heater, Au film as pad, Cr/Au as controlling electrode arrays, high quality SiO2 film as dielectric layer on glass substrate is fabricated by silicon bulk process and employs fluorocarbon polymer as hydrophobic layer to functionalize the surface to be hydrophobic so as to facilitate droplet transportation. Test results show that transportation velocity of 3 µl DI water and silicone oil can reach 0.1 mm/s and 1 mm/s respectively at a voltage of 7 V. Driving voltage, transportation velocity of droplets and effect of contact angle hysteresis are discussed and the results are in agreement with theoretical results. The results provide some practical guidelines for the design of microfluidic chips based on thermocapillary actuation. In this study, we demonstrated that thermocapillary actuation of droplets is tunable and the chip can find great application in lab-on-a-chip due to its simple structure and low-cost fabrication process.},

  abstract = {Motion control is widely used in industrial applications since machinery, robots, conveyor bands use smooth movements in order to reach a desired position decreasing the steady error and energy consumption. In this paper, a new Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) -type fuzzy logic controller (FLC) tuning strategy that is based on direct fuzzy relations is proposed in order to compute the PID constants. The motion control algorithm is composed by PID-type FLC and S-curve velocity profile, which is developed in C/C++ programming language; therefore, a license is not required to reproduce the code among embedded systems. The self-tuning controller is carried out online, it depends on error and change in error to adapt according to the system variations. The experimental results were obtained in a linear platform integrated by a direct current (DC) motor connected to an encoder to measure the position. The shaft of the motor is connected to an endless screw; a cart is placed on the screw to control its position. The rise time, overshoot, and settling time values measured in the experimentation are 0.124 s, 8.985\% and 0.248 s, respectively. These results presented in part 6 demonstrate the performance of the controller, since the rise time and settling time are improved according to the state of the art. Besides, these parameters are compared with different control architectures reported in the literature. This comparison is made after applying a step input signal to the DC motor.},

In this paper, we consider the use of cyclic voltammetry and chronocoulometry to allow for the determination of the real electrochemical area of screen-printed electrochemical sensing platforms, highlighting to experimentalists the various parameters that need to be diligently considered and controlled in order to obtain useful measurements of the real electroactive area.},

The depFFF method can not only exploit intrinsic tumor cell properties so that labeling is unnecessary but can also deliver unmodified, viable tumor cells for culture and/or all types of molecular analysis. We investigated tumor cell recovery efficiency as a function of cell loading for a 25\,mm wide × 300\,mm long depFFF chamber. More than 90\% of tumor cells were recovered for small samples but a larger chamber will be required if similarly high recovery efficiencies are to be realized for 10\,mL blood specimens used CTC analysis in clinics. We show that the factor limiting isolation efficiency is cell–cell dielectric interactions and that isolation protocols should be completed within ∼15\,min in order to avoid changes in cell dielectric properties associated with ion leakage.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new method to construct microfluidic devices especially useful for bulk acoustic wave (BAW)-based manipulation of cells and microparticles. To obtain efficient acoustic focusing, BAW devices require materials that have high acoustic impedance mismatch relative to the medium in which the cells/microparticles are suspended and materials with a high-quality factor. To date, silicon and glass have been the materials of choice for BAW-based acoustofluidic channel fabrication. Siliconand glass-based fabrication is typically performed in clean room facilities, generates hazardous waste, and can take several hours to complete the microfabrication. To address some of the drawbacks in fabricating conventional BAW devices, we explored a new approach by micromachining microfluidic channels in aluminum substrates. Additionally, we demonstrate plasma bonding of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) onto micromachined aluminum substrates. Our goal was to achieve an approach that is both low cost and effective in BAW applications. To this end, we micromachined aluminum 6061 plates and enclosed the systems with a thin PDMS cover layer. These aluminum/PDMS hybrid microfluidic devices use inexpensive materials and are simply constructed outside a clean room environment. Moreover, these devices demonstrate effectiveness in BAW applications as demonstrated by efficient acoustic focusing of polystyrene microspheres, bovine red blood cells, and Jurkat cells and the generation of multiple focused streams in flow-through systems.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) and dielectrowetting (DEW) are two major principles to drive droplets in digital microfluidics. EWOD is effective to manipulate (create, transport, split, and merge) conductive droplets being currently used for many biological, chemical, and optical applications. DEW can also manipulate droplets but more efficiently with dielectric (nonconductive) fluids. A digital microfluidic platform efficiently operable by both EWOD and DEW would offer higher versatility in handling a wide range of fluids, regardless of their conductivities. In this regard, this article presents a new hybrid electrode design enabling EWOD and DEW to drive various kinds of droplet fluids on a single platform. In addition, a slippery liquid‐infused surface (SLIPS) is integrated with the hybrid electrodes. The SLIPS is well known to resist biofouling and repel sticky fluids, which endows the hybrid electrodes with much wider application spectra. As a result, the present SLIPS‐integrated hybrid electrodes facilitate actuating various kinds of fluids which would not be driven by conventional EWOD and/or DEW electrodes. This paper presents the successful transportation of not only conductive fluids including water, protein solution, glycerol, and honey but also nonconductive fluids including dodecane, silicone oil, and light and heavy crude oil, all driven by the SLIPS‐integrated hybrid electrodes. The performance comparisons among solid, interdigitating, and hybrid electrodes are made by testing both conductive and nonconductive droplets.},

  abstract = {Rivers are important natural resources of a country as they provide a wide range of ecosystem services. However, the problem is that rivers in Malaysia are badly degraded due to mismanagement, neglect, pollution and abuse. River management in Malaysia is largely based on the government-centric top-down model which is sectoral-based. This model is ineffective as it has no private sector, NGO and public engagement and support. This paper aims to examine various types of river management models to identify the ones that can be effective in Malaysia. The methodology used a mixture of literature review of existing river management models, secondary data on published journal papers, reports and books on river management. Results of selected river management conferences are also studied, examined and findings synthesized. Primary data is also compiled with selected in-depth qualitative interviews with key government officers, managers of private companies, NGO officers and village heads. Results show that the government (various levels) is traditionally the responsible party in managing rivers, but increasingly, the public, NGOs, businesses and other stakeholders are actively involved. Results also show that holistic river management with active engagement of all stakeholders is necessary. In Malaysia, rivers are found to be intricately intertwined with all aspects of development. It was concluded that the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model is an effective river management model in Malaysia as it conserves the river and its environment, and brings together all parties for building their capacities in river management towards achieving many Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).},

  abstract = {Both passive and active microfluidic chips are used in many biomedical and chemical ap‑plications to support fluid mixing, particle manipulations, and signal detection. Passive microfluidic devices are geometry‑dependent, and their uses are rather limited. Active microfluidic devices in‑clude sensors or detectors that transduce chemical, biological, and physical changes into electrical or optical signals. Also, they are transduction devices that detect biological and chemical changes in biomedical applications, and they are highly versatile microfluidic tools for disease diagnosis and organ modeling. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the significant advances that have been made in the development of microfluidics devices. We will discuss the function of mi‑crofluidic devices as micromixers or as sorters of cells and substances (e.g., microfiltration, flow or displacement, and trapping). Microfluidic devices are fabricated using a range of techniques, includ‑ing molding, etching, three‑dimensional printing, and nanofabrication. Their broad utility lies in the detection of diagnostic biomarkers and organ‑on‑chip approaches that permit disease modeling in cancer, as well as uses in neurological, cardiovascular, hepatic, and pulmonary diseases. Biosensor applications allow for point‑of‑care testing, using assays based on enzymes, nanozymes, antibodies, or nucleic acids (DNA or RNA). An anticipated development in the field includes the optimization of techniques for the fabrication of microfluidic devices using biocompatible materials. These devel‑opments will increase biomedical versatility, reduce diagnostic costs, and accelerate diagnosis time of microfluidics technology.},

Besides, EIS is one of the few techniques that has been proven useful for membrane fouling detection. Electrodes are some of the most essential components for analytes detection applications with EIS. With the advances in printing technology, the fabrication of advanced printed electrode systems with miniature designs and improved sensitivity for electrochemical sensing is made possible. This review addresses recent advances in printed electrodes for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy with the emphasis placed on discussing the use of printed electrodes for membrane fouling detection. Common electrode designs and materials for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are discussed, along with practical examples of these printed electrodes. The commonly used printing techniques for the fabrication of printed electrodes are also deliberated. The successful realization of printed electrodes for EIS requires careful design of electrodes, proper selection of electrode materials, as well as optimization of the printing process. It is expected that printed electrodes will be widely accepted for EIS sensing applications and will facilitate the creation of low‐cost high‐performance sensing devices.},

One of the most important stages in this process requires rapid and effective identification of pathogenic bacteria responsible for diseases. Current gold standard techniques of bacterial detection include culture methods, polymerase chain reactions, and immunoassays. However, their use is fraught with downsides with high turnaround time and low accuracy being the most prominent. This imposes great limitations on their eventual application as point‐of‐care devices. Over time, innovative detection techniques have been proposed and developed to curb these drawbacks. In this review, a systematic summary of a range of biosensing platforms is provided with a strong focus on technologies conferring high detection sensitivity and specificity. A thorough analysis is performed and the benefits and drawbacks of each type of biosensor are highlighted, the factors influencing their potential as point‐of‐care devices are discussed, and the authors' insights for their translation from proof‐of‐concept systems into commercial medical devices are provided.},

A digital microfluidic system typically consists of a planar array of cells with electrodes that control the droplets. The primary challenge in using droplet-based systems is that they require the simultaneous coordination of a potentially large number of droplets on the array as the droplets move, mix, and split. In this paper we describe a general-purpose system that uses simple algorithms and yet is versatile. First, we present a semi-automated approach to generate the array layout in terms of components. Next, we discuss simple algorithms to select destination components for the droplets and a decentralized scheme for components to route the droplets on the array. These are then combined into a reconfigurable system that has been simulated in software to perform analyses such as the DNA polymerase chain reaction. The algorithms have been able to successfully coordinate hundreds of droplets simultaneously and perform one or more chemical analyses in parallel. Because it is challenging to analytically characterize the behavior of such systems, simulation methods to detect potential system instability are proposed.},

  abstract = {The complexity of droplet microfluidics grows with the implementation of parallel processes and multiple functionalities on a single device. This poses a severe challenge to the engineer designing the corresponding microfluidic networks. In today’s design processes, the engineer relies on calculations, assumptions, simplifications, as well as his/her experiences and intuitions. To validate the obtained specification of the microfluidic network, usually a prototype is fabricated and physical experiments are conducted thus far. In case the design does not implement the desired functionality, this prototyping iteration is repeated—obviously resulting in an expensive and time-consuming design process. To avoid unnecessary debugging loops involving fabrication and testing, simulation methods could help to initially validate the specification of the microfluidic network before any prototype is fabricated. However, state-of-the-art simulation tools come with severe limitations, which prevent their utilization for practically relevant applications. More precisely, they are often not dedicated to droplet microfluidics, cannot handle the required physical phenomena, are not publicly available, and can hardly be extended. In this work, we present an advanced simulation approach for droplet microfluidics that addresses these shortcomings and, eventually, allows simulating practically relevant applications. To this end, we propose a simulation framework at the one-dimensional analysis model, which directly works on the specification of the design, supports essential physical phenomena, is publicly available, and is easy to extend. Evaluations and case studies demonstrate the benefits of the proposed simulator: While current state-of-the-art tools were not applicable for practically relevant microfluidic networks, the proposed simulator allows reducing the design time and costs, e.g., of a drug screening device from one person month and USD 1200, respectively, to just a fraction of that.},

The objective of this flow is to facilitate fast assay synthesis while minimally compromising the quality of results. In particular, we show that a virtual topology, which constrains the allowable locations of assay operations such as mixing, dilution, sensing, etc., in lieu of traditional placement, can significantly speed up the synthesis process without significantly lengthening assay execution time. We present a base virtual topology and show how it can be leveraged to reduce algorithmic runtimes and guarantee rout ability. We later present several variations of the virtual topology and present experimental results demonstrating best-design practices. We present two binding solutions. The first is a left-edge binding algorithm, while the second is a more intelligent path-based binding algorithm that leverages spatial and temporal locality to produce superior results.},

Progress has been made particularly with regard to (sub-) microstructure technology and material sciences. Improvements are displayed based on the impact on a new generation of SAW sensors working efficiently in liquid media, from modeling to the fabrication steps of the individual components. It is explained, which obstacles have to be overcome for applications to the bioanalytical field. SAW sensors are shown to be extremely useful for the analysis of both small and large molecules as well as whole cells interacting with an immobilized binding partner. The output signal gives information about the pure mass loading, intrinsic properties of bound materials, or viscoelastic effects like structural rearrangements. Different setups are shown that minimize the influence of physical bulk effects on the sensor signal, e.g. salt content and viscosity. The choice of materials which can be used for sensible surfaces are presented, enabling the development of completely new coupling chemistries. Finally, the advantages compared to other biosensor technologies are pointed out.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting-based microdrop manipulation has received considerable attention owing to its wide applications in numerous scientific areas based on the digital microfluidics (DMF) technology. However, the techniques for highly precise droplet handling in such microscopic systems are still unclear. In this work, the deformation, speed, and stability of droplet transporting in closed electrowetting-based DMF systems are comprehensively investigated with both theoretical and numerical analyses. First, a theoretical model is derived which governs the droplet motion and includes the influences of the key electrowetting system parameters. After that, a finite volume formulation with a two-step projection method is used for solving the microfluidic flow on a fixed numerical domain. The liquid-gas interface of the droplet is tracked by a coupled level-set and volume-of-fluid method, and the surface tension at the interface is computed by the continuum surface force scheme. A parametric study has been carried out to examine the effects of the static contact angles (θs,ON and θs,OFF), hysteresis effect (Δθ), channel height (H), and electrode size (LE) on droplet shape, speed, and deformation during transport, which unanimously shows that droplet length, neck width, and transport stability are directly related to a dimensionless parameter κ* that only comprises θs,ON, θs,OFF, H, LE, and the hysteresis angle Δθ. Based on the results, the scaling laws for estimating droplet shape and stability of the transport process have been developed, which can be used for promoting the accuracy and efficiency of droplet manipulation in a large variety of droplet-based DMF applications.},

A great deal of effort has been devoted to advancing this technology by means of enhancing droplet speed and stability. In this work, we numerically investigate the continuous droplet transport process in a parallel-plate EWOD DMF device with a previously proposed “stripped electrode” design and compare it with the transport motion of the conventional “square electrode” design. The microfluidic droplet motion is solved by a finite volume formulation on a fixed computational domain. The gas-liquid interface of a droplet is captured by a coupled level-set and volume-of-fluid scheme with the surface tension force at the interface computed by the continuum surface force method. A simplified viscous stress scheme reliant on the Hele-Shaw flow model is used to evaluate the viscous forces exerted by the parallel plates. The numerically simulated transport processes of the “stripped electrode” and “square electrode” designs show good agreement with the experimental results. Furthermore, a parametric study is conducted in which the influences of the strip number, activated contact angle, and gap spacing between the plates on droplet transport speed and stability are examined. It has been found that both the transport speed and stability can be noticeably improved by the “stripped electrode” design, which can be adopted for promoting the transport efficiency in a large number of droplet-based applications utilizing parallel-plate EWOD DMF systems.},

In this work, we propose a new configuration comprising only stripped electrodes of rectangular shape for the closed electrowetting-on-dielectric digital microfluidic (EWOD DMF) system and investigate its parallel microdrop generation outcomes via a numerical approach. The microfluidic droplet motion is solved by a finite-volume scheme on a fixed computational domain. The numerical model is verified by an experimental study of microdrop production from an EWOD DMF device with three different electrode designs. After model verification, we examine the influences of the equilibrium contact angle and the spacing of the microchannel on stripped electrode based microdrop generation outcomes and discover five different regimes including the phenomena of satellite droplet formation and separation cessation. Despite the various generation outcomes, the daughter droplet size is found to vary linearly with a dimensionless EWOD parameter κ*. More importantly, for all successful generations, the deviation of the daughter droplet size from that of the stripped electrode is smaller than 3.5\%, which even reaches zero in proper conditions. This new configuration can be utilized as a convenient alternative for electrowetting-induced parallel microdrop production with excellent precision and controllability.},

  abstract = {Two-phase flow microfluidics is emerging as a popular technology for a wide range of applications involving high throughput such as encapsulation, chemical synthesis and biochemical assays. Within this platform, the formation and merging of droplets inside an immiscible carrier fluid are two key procedures: (i) the emulsification step should lead to a very well controlled drop size (distribution); and (ii) the use of droplet as micro-reactors requires a reliable merging. A novel trend within this field is the use of additional active means of control besides the commonly used hydrodynamic manipulation. Electric fields are especially suitable for this, due to quantitative control over the amplitude and time dependence of the signals, and the flexibility in designing micro-electrode geometries. With this, the formation and merging of droplets can be achieved on-demand and with high precision. In this review on two-phase flow microfluidics, particular emphasis is given on these aspects. Also recent innovations in microfabrication technologies used for this purpose will be discussed.},

  abstract = {A simple and low budget microfabrication method compatible with mass production was developed for the integration of electrodes for capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection (C4D) in Lab on a Chip devices. Electrodes were patterned on a printed circuit board using standard processing. This was followed by lamination–photolithography–lamination to cover the electrodes in dry film photoresist (DFR) using an office laminator. This resulted in a flush, smooth surface on top of the detection electrodes, enabling subsequent integration of a microfluidic network at a distance dictated by the thickness of the DFR (17 m, 30 m and 60 m were used in this work). This process was applied to create two types of detectors, re-usable detectors to be used in combination with a separate microfluidic network and integrated detectors where the microfluidic network is irreversibly sealed to the detector. A poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) slab containing the microfluidic network was positioned on top of the re-usable detectors to create the PDMS hybrid devices. The integrated DFR devices were created by patterning and sealing the microchannel in DFR using subsequent lamination and lithographic steps. The sensitivity of the C4D made using this new technology for small inorganic cations was between 6 and 20 M, which is comparable with devices made using significantly more advanced technologies. Where the 17 m film slightly improved the sensitivity, the use of 30 m thick insulating films was preferred as these did not impose significant restrictions on the applicable field strengths.},

  abstract = {Electrohydrodynamic wetting manipulation plays a major role in modern microfluidic technologies such as lab-on-a-chip applications and digital microfluidics. Liquid dielectrophoresis (LDEP) is a common driving mechanism, which induces hydrodynamic motion in liquids by the application of nonhomogeneous electrical fields. Among strategies to analyze droplet movement, systematic research on the influence of different frequencies under AC voltage is missing. In this paper, we therefore present a first study covering the motion characteristics of LDEP-driven droplets of the dielectric liquids ethylene glycol and glycerol carbonate in the driving voltage frequency range from 50 Hz to 1600 Hz. A correlation between the switching speed of LDEP-actuated droplets in a planar electrode configuration and the frequency of the applied voltage is shown. Hereby, motion times of different-sized droplets could be reduced by up to a factor of 5.3. A possible excitation of the droplets within their range of eigenfrequencies is investigated using numerical calculations. The featured fluidic device is designed using larger-sized electrodes rather than typical finger or strip electrodes, which are commonly employed in LDEP devices. The influence of the electrode shape is considered simulatively by studying the electric field gradients.},

We focus on its theoretical model, and a mathematical expression of the capacitance value is derived by solving a Laplace equation with Hankel transform. The finite element method is employed to verify the analytical result. Different control parameters are discussed, and each contribution to the capacitance value of the capacitor is obtained. On this basis, we analyze and optimize the structure parameters of a segmented coplanar capacitive tilt sensor, and three models with different positions of the electrode gap are fabricated and tested. The experimental result shows that the model (whose electrode-gap position is 10 mm from the electrode center) realizes a high sensitivity: 0.129 pF/˝ with a non-linearity of {$<$}0.4\% FS (full scale of ˘40˝). This finding offers plenty of opportunities for various measurement requirements in addition to achieving an optimized structure in practical design.},

However, conventional methods for               K               d               characterization usually involve a multi-step process and time-consuming operations for incubation, washing, and detection, thus causing problems, such as time delays, microbead loss, degradation of sensitive molecules, and personal errors. Here we demonstrate an automated ligand binding affinity evaluation platform (Auto-affitech) using digital microfluidics (DMF), with individual droplets at the microliter level, programmed to rapidly perform the incubation and separation of target-beads and binding ligands. Because the loss of the beads influences the detection results, we propose a new strategy for magnetic bead separation using DMF, termed the bidirectional separation method. By splitting one droplet into two asymmetric droplets, high bead retention efficiency (89.57\% ± 0.05\%) and high washing efficiency (99.59\% ± 0.17\%, with four washings) were obtained. We demonstrate the determination of               K               d               of an aptamer–protein system (EpCAM and its corresponding aptamer SYL3C) and an antigen–antibody system (H5N1 antigen and antibody), proving the capability and universality of Auto-affitech in various receptor–ligand systems. Integrating all the sample processing procedures, the Auto-affitech not only saves manual labor and minimizes personal errors, but also conserves samples and shortens analysis time. Overall, this platform successfully demonstrates to be an automated approach for dissociation constant evaluation and exhibits great potential for highly efficient screening of ligands.},

  abstract = {The heat transport capacity of traditional heat pipes is limited by the capillary pressure generated in the internal wick that pumps condensate to the evaporator. Recently, the authors conceptualized a novel heat pipe architecture, wherein wick-based pumping is replaced by electrowetting (EW)-based pumping of microliter droplets in the adiabatic section. An electrowetting heat pipe (EHP) can overcome the capillary limit to heat transport capacity and enable compact, planar, gravity-insensitive, and ultralow power consumption heat pipes that transport kiloWatt heat loads over extended distances. This work develops a novel technique for rapid, scalable fabrication of EW-based devices and studies critical microfluidic operations underlying the EHP, with the objective of predicting the key performance parameters of the EHP. Devices are fabricated on a printed circuit board (PCB) substrate with mechanically-milled electrodes, and a removable polyimide dielectric film. The first set of experiments uncovers the maximum channel gap (1 mm) for reliable EW-based pumping; this parameter determines the heat transport capacity of the EHP, which scales linearly with the channel gap. The second set of experiments uncovers the maximum channel gap (375 microns) at which EW voltages can successfully split droplets. This is an important consideration which ensures EHP operability in the event of unintentional droplet merging. The third set of experiments demonstrate and study EW-induced droplet generation from an open-to-air reservoir, which mimics the interface between the condenser and adiabatic sections of the EHP. The experimental findings predict that planar, water-based EHPs with a (10 cm by 4 mm) cross section can transport 1.6 kW over extended distances ({$>$}1 m), with a thermal resistance of 0.01 K W−1.},

Through designing the biosensor in such a way that it becomes a membrane with holes, we can apply a droplet on it and push or pull it through the membrane by means of a pressure difference. Contrary to traditional microfluidics for, e.g., flow cells where the analyte flows over the sensor, the flow is now directed through the sensor. We have implemented this scheme in silicon-on-insulator biosensors and have demonstrated in a first proof-of-principle experiment, an improvement in delivery time of at least a factor of three.},

  abstract = {A study on water quality status of Tekala River, Selangor, Malaysia was conducted at two sampling times. A total of six sampling stations were selected along the river representing the upstream (S1 and S2), the middle stream (S3 and S4) and the downstream (S5 and S6) of the Tekala River. In this study, in-situ and ex-situ analyses were conducted to determine the quality of Tekala River. Physical, chemical and biological parameters included biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (SOD), ammoniacal nitrogen, total suspended solids (TSS), dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, temperature, total dissolved solid (TDS), salinity, conductivity, Escherichia coli, coliform and macroinvertebrate. According to the result obtained from this study, Tekala River is classified under Class I and Class II based on water quality index and National water quality standard. Two-way ANOVA showed a significant difference between parameters (ammoniacal nitrogen, BOD, pH, temperature, conductivity, DO and TDS) of sampling station. Significant difference was found between ammoniacal nitrogen, pH and temperature with sampling time. The correlation test revealed that there is relationship between Escherichia coli with ammoniacal nitrogen, temperature and DO. There is also relationship found between coliform with pH and BOD.},

Here, a label-free lateral dielectrophoresis-based microfluidic sorting platform that can digitally quantify and separate microalgae into six outlets based on the degree of their intracellular lipid content is presented. In this microfluidic system, the degree of cellular lateral displacement is inversely proportional to the intracellular lipid level, which was successfully demonstrated using               Chlamydomonas reinhardtii               cells. Using this functionality, a quick digital quantification of sub-populations that contain different intracellular lipid level in a given population was achieved. In addition, the degree of lateral displacement of microalgae could be readily controlled by simply changing the applied DEP voltage, where the level of gating in the intracellular lipid-based sorting decision could be easily adjusted. This allowed for selecting only a very small percentage of a given population that showed the highest degree of intracellular lipid content. In addition, this approach was utilized through an iterative selection process on natural and chemically mutated microalgal populations, successfully resulting in enrichment of high-lipid-accumulating microalgae. In summary, the developed platform can be exploited to quickly quantify microalgae lipid distribution in a given population in real-time and label-free, as well as to enrich a cell population with high-lipid-producing cells, or to select high-lipid-accumulating microalgal variants from a microalgal library.},

  abstract = {Micro-nanofluidic technology is widely used in food safety testing, drug screening, new material synthesis and bioengineering. Droplet microfluidic technology is an important branch of micro-nanofluidic technology. The microdroplet technology can produce high-throughput monodisperse droplets. The droplet technology overcomes many problems of continuous flow, such as small sample reagent volume, no cross-contamination, and rapid chemical reaction. So microdroplets have an important position in the fields of single cell analysis, gene sequencing, and real-time diagnosis. This review focuses on the different methods and applications of microdroplet generation in microfluidics. The droplet generation methods are passive and active methods. The passive method does not require external force, while the active method requires external force such as external electric field, magnetic field, acoustic field, and laser field. It is predicted that the quantitative generation of droplets on demand in microfluidics will be the important direction for future research. This review provides new ideas for the applications of the quantitative generation of microdroplets on demand in microfluidics.},

Around 75 percent of the pathogens causing these infections are of animal origin. Point-of-care tests (POCT) and point-of-need tests (PONT) have been established in order to directly provide accurate and rapid diagnostics at field level, the patient bed-side or at the site of outbreaks. These assays can help physicians and decision makers to take the right action without delay. Typically, POCT and PONT rely on genomic identification of pathogens or track their immunological fingerprint. Recently, protocols for metagenomic diagnostics in the field have been developed. In this review, we give an overview of the latest developments in portable diagnostic methods. In addition, four mobile platforms for the implementation of these techniques at point-of-care and point-of-need are described. These approaches can provide reliable diagnostics and surveillance, especially in low resource settings as well as at the level of one health.},

This review mainly focuses on the recent developments towards the droplet manipulation on LIS with different mechanisms induced by various external stimuli, including thermo, light, electric, magnetism, and mechanical force. First, the droplet condition on LIS, determined by the properties of the droplet, the lubricant and substrate, is illustrated. Droplet manipulation via altering the droplet regime realized by different mechanisms, such as varying slipperiness, electrostatic force and wettability, is discussed. Moreover, some applications on droplet manipulation employed in various filed, including microreactors, microfluidics, etc., are also presented. Finally, a summary of this work and possible future research directions for the transport of droplets on smart LIS are outlined to promote the development of this field.},

Moreover, the connectivity of smartphones gives the possibility to share and provide real‐time results when needed, whether in health diagnostics, environmental monitoring, immunoassays or food safety. Undoubtedly, the marriage of smartphones and microfluidics has a brilliant future in building low cost and easily operable systems for analysis in the field, realizing the idea of people's “smartlife”. The aim of this review is to present and summarize the main advantages and disadvantages of the use of smartphones as well as to take a closer look at some novel achievements published during the last couple of years.

  abstract = {The ability to selectively move and trap proteins is core to their effective use as building blocks and for their characterization. Analytical and preparative strategies for proteins have been pursued and modeled for nearly a hundred years, with great advances and success. Core to all of these studies is the separation, isolation, purification, and concentration of pure homogeneous fractions of a specific protein in solution. Processes to accomplish this useful solution include biphasic equilibrium (chromatographies, extractions), mechanical, bulk property, chemical equilibria, and molecular recognition. Ultimately, the goal of all of these is to physically remove all non-like protein molecules—to the finest detail: all atoms in the full three-dimensional structure being identical down the chemical bond and bulk structure chirality. One strategy which has not been effectively pursued is exploiting the higher order subtle electrical properties of the protein-solvent system. The advent of microfluidic systems has enabled the use of very high electric fields and welldefined gradients such that extremely high resolution separations of protein mixtures are possible. These advances and recognition of these capabilities have caused a re-evaluation of the underlying theoretical models and they were found to be inadequate. New theoretical descriptions are being considered which align more closely to the total forces present and the subtlety of differences between similar proteins. These are focused on the interfacial area between the protein and hydrating solvent molecules, as opposed to the macroscale assumptions of homogeneous solutions and particles. This critical review examines all data which has been published that place proteins in electric field gradients which induce collection of those proteins, demonstrating a force greater than dispersive effects or countering forces. Evolving theoretical constructs are presented and discussed, and a general estimate of future capabilities using the higher order effects and the high fields and precise gradients of microfluidic systems is discussed.},

  abstract = {The large-scale electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) digital microfluidic platforms always require complex electrode-addressing schemes and high-cost fabrication methods of dielectric and hydrophobic layers. Hence, the voltage polarity-dependent electrowetting was used to actuate droplets with asymmetric printed circuit board (PCB) electrodes on an open slippery liquid-infused porous surface (SLIPS) chip. The V-shaped, convex-shaped, and curve-shaped coplanar asymmetric electrode arrays were designed to achieve the directional motion of a droplet by a square wave voltage signal. The operation ranges of voltage amplitude and frequency for continuously actuating a 10 µl droplet were obtained on the three asymmetric electrode arrays. Our results found that the curve-shaped electrode array has a broader voltage operation range than the other two for continuous pumping of a 10 µl droplet. It is because the droplet has a long effective width of contact line with the front curve-shaped electrode and does not overlap with the rear electrode during the movement. Meanwhile, a reconfigurable convex-shaped electrode structure was also proposed to achieve bidirectional actuation of a droplet by controlling the square wave voltage. This work provides a low-cost, straightforward electrodeaddressing scheme for designing digital microfluidic devices.},

To understand the variability and to improve the biomedical requirement of a single cell, its analysis has become a key technique in biological and biomedical research. With a physical boundary of microchannels and microstructures, single cells are efficiently captured and analyzed, whereas electric forces sort and position single cells. Various microfluidic techniques have been exploited to manipulate single cells through hydrodynamic and electric forces. Digital microfluidics (DMF), the manipulation of individual droplets holding minute reagents and cells of interest by electric forces, has received more attention recently. Because of ease of fabrication, compactness and prospective automation, DMF has become a powerful approach for biological application. We review recent developments of various microfluidic chips for analysis of a single cell and for efficient genetic screening. In addition, perspectives to develop analysis of single cells based on DMF and emerging functionality with high throughput are discussed.},

The electrowetting phenomenon on modified SLIPS was investigated first, and it exhibited an up to 55° contact angle difference with respect to voltage polarity while the threshold voltage was reduced to only 2 V. Then, a coplanar electrode experiment was designed to study the performance of droplet manipulation on several modified SLIPS samples with different vertically placed times and silicon oil viscosities. The optimal condition for preparing a modified SLIPS membrane is that a sample is placed vertically for 2 hours after infusing 10 cSt silicon oil, on which the droplet can be driven with the fastest velocity, and the activation voltage for moving a droplet is only 8 V. Finally, multi-droplet simultaneous and continuous manipulation on modified SLIPS in bi-direction on a loop of square electrodes was achieved. Interestingly, unlike asymmetric electrowetting, actuation methods on a solid insulator and hydrophobic layers, the droplet actuation velocity was not limited by the contact angle saturation effect and always increased with the applied voltage on modified SLIPS. This method achieves a very wide range of droplet continuous manipulation velocities from 0.075 mm s               −1               to 123 mm s               −1               under 20 V to 500 V applied voltage and the continuous droplet actuation voltage exhibits at least a 15-fold decrease compared to that of an unmodified SLIPS membrane.},

  abstract = {Point of care (PoC) diagnostics are at the focus of government initiatives, NGOs and fundamental research alike. In high-income countries, the hope is to streamline the diagnostic procedure, minimize costs and make healthcare processes more efficient and faster, which, in some cases, can be more a matter of convenience than necessity. However, in resource-limited settings such as low-income countries, PoC-diagnostics might be the only viable route, when the next laboratory is hours away. Therefore, it is especially important to focus research into novel diagnostics for these countries in order to alleviate suffering due to infectious disease. In this review, the current research describing the use of PoC diagnostics in resource-limited settings and the potential bottlenecks along the value chain that prevent their widespread application is summarized. To this end, we will look at literature that investigates different parts of the value chain, such as fundamental research and market economics, as well as actual use at healthcare providers. We aim to create an integrated picture of potential PoC barriers, from the first start of research at universities to patient treatment in the field. Results from the literature will be discussed with the aim to bring all important steps and aspects together in order to illustrate how effectively PoC is being used in low-income countries. In addition, we discuss what is needed to improve the situation further, in order to use this technology to its fullest advantage and avoid “leaks in the pipeline”, when a promising device fails to take the next step of the valorization pathway and is abandoned.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The combination of ammonia fuel and proton‐conducting fuel cells (PCFCs) technology may provide an ideal clean energy system for the future, considering matured NH               3               synthesis technology and transportation and storage infrastructure, the high energy density of NH               3               , and the high efficiency of fuel cells. However, poor catalytic activity of the anode for NH               3               decomposition, quick performance degradation due to the ammonia induced nickel coarsening, difficult sintering, and insufficient proton conductivity of electrolytes are the main challenges for stable and high‐power generation from ammonia‐fueled PCFCs. Herein, a new Ba(Zr               0.1               Ce               0.7               Y               0.1               Yb               0.1               )               0.95               Pd               0.05               O               3−                                δ                              perovskite is reported as a key anode component and electrolyte, which demonstrates multifunctionalities and tackles most challenges of conventional PCFCs. The incorporation of a small amount of Pd boosts catalytic activity of the nickel‐perovskite cermet anode for NH               3               decomposition and increases proton conductivity from the creation of B‐site cation deficiency and electrolyte sintering. The corresponding thin‐film electrolyte PCFC delivers a maximum power density of 724~mW cm               –2               at 650~°C operated on NH               3               , much higher than the similar cell without Pd incorporation (450~mW cm               –2               ). Furthermore, no apparent performance decay is observed for the cell operated at 550~°C in H               2               and NH               3               for 350 h, making it highly promising for practical applications.},

Interfacing tools are required both for loading preconfigured microtiter-plate (MTP)-based sample collections into droplets and for dispensing the used droplets samples back into MTPs for subsequent storage or further processing. Here, we present a collection of Digital Microfluidic Pipetting Tips (DMPTs) with integrated facilities for droplet generation and manipulation together with a robotic system for its operation. This combination serves as a bidirectional sampling interface for sample transfer from wells into droplets (w2d) and vice versa droplets into wells (d2w). The DMPT were designed to fit into 96-deep-well MTPs and prepared from glass by means of microsystems technology. The aspirated samples are converted into the channel-confined droplets’ sequences separated by an immiscible carrier medium. To comply with the demands of dose-response assays, up to three additional assay compound solutions can be added to the sample droplets. To enable different procedural assay protocols, four different DMPT variants were made. In this way, droplet series with gradually changing composition can be generated for, e.g., 2D screening purposes. The developed DMPT and their common fluidic connector are described here. To handle the opposite transfer d2w, a robotic transfer system was set up and is described briefly.},

  abstract = {A nonionic particle placed in the gradient of an electric field experiences the dielectrophoretic force which scales linearly with the gradient of the electric field squared. The proportionality constant is the dielectrophoretic susceptibility, that is, a linear transport coefficient. For proteins in solution, it is mostly affected by the following two parameters: the squared dipole moment and the cavity susceptibility accounting for cross-correlations of the protein dipole with the hydration shell (protein−water Kirkwood factor). Both of these parameters enter the dielectric increment of the solution which fully specifies the dielectrophoretic susceptibility. The link between these two measurable properties is proven here to hold using molecular dynamics simulations of solvated proteins. The dielectrophoretic susceptibility for proteins is in the range of 104, significantly exceeding traditional estimates limiting it to values below unity. Part of this large magnitude of the dielectrophoretic response is the cavity susceptibility of the protein−water interface, which significantly exceeds dielectric estimates. The study analyzes local fields inside the protein in terms of the reaction-field and directingfield components. We find that the local field exceeds the external field by a substantial factor described by the local field susceptibility. The electric field produced by water inside the protein is retarded by 3−4 orders of magnitude compared to the bulk.},

  abstract = {Digital (droplet-based) microfluidic systems apply electromagnetic characteristics as the fundamental fluid actuation mechanism. These systems are often implemented in two-dimensional architectures, overcoming one-dimensional continuous flow channel practical issues. The fundamental operation for digital microfluidics requires the creation of an electric field distribution to achieve desired fluid actuation. The electric field distribution is typically non-uniform, enabling creation of net dielectrophoresis (DEP) force. The DEP force magnitude is proportional to the difference between microdroplet and surrounding medium complex dielectric constants, and the gradient of the electric field magnitude squared. Force sign/direction can be manipulated to achieve a force towards higher (positive DEP) or lower (negative DEP) electrostatic energy by tailoring the relative difference between microdroplet and surrounding medium complex dielectric constants through careful selection of the devices fabrication materials. The DEP force magnitudes and directions are applied here for well-controlled and high-speed microdroplet actuation. Control and speed characteristics arise from significant differences in the microdroplet/medium conductivity and the use of a micropin architecture with strong electric field gradients. The implementation, referred to here as a DEP microjet, establishes especially strong axial propulsion forces. Single- and double-micropin topologies achieve strong axial propulsion force, but only the double-micropin topology creates transverse converging forces for stable and controlled microdroplet actuation. Electric field distributions for each topology are investigated and linked to axial and transverse forces. Experimental results are presented for both topologies. The double-micropin topology is tested with biological fluids. Microdroplet actuation speeds up to 25 cm/s are achieved—comparable to the fastest speeds to-date.},

  abstract = {Advances in droplet-based digital microfluidics have led to the emergence of biochips for automating laboratory procedures in biochemistry and molecular biology. These devices enable the precise control of microliter of nanoliter volumes of biochemical samples and reagents. They combine electronics with biology, and integrate various bioassay operations, such as sample preparation, analysis, separation, and detection. Compared to conventional laboratory procedures, which are cumbersome and expensive, miniaturized digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) offer the advantages of higher sensitivity, lower cost, system integration, and less likelihood of human error. This tutorial paper provides an overview of DMFBs and describes emerging computer-aided design (CAD) tools for the automated synthesis and optimization of biochips, from physical modeling to fluidic-level synthesis and then to chip-level design. By efficiently utilizing the electronic design automation (EDA) technique on emerging CAD tools, users can concentrate on the development of nanoscale bioassays, leaving chip optimization and implementation details to design-automation tools.},

  abstract = {Microfluidic biochips are replacing the conventional biochemical analyzers, and are able to integrate on-chip all the basic functions for biochemical analysis. The “digital” microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) are manipulating liquids not as a continuous flow, but as discrete droplets on a two-dimensional array of electrodes. Basic microfluidic operations, such as mixing and dilution, are performed on the array, by routing the corresponding droplets on a series of electrodes. The challenges facing biochips are similar to those faced by microelectronics some decades ago. To meet the challenges of increasing design complexity, computer-aided-design (CAD) tools are being developed for DMFBs. This paper provides an overview of DMFBs and describes emerging CAD tools for the automated synthesis and optimization of DMFB designs, from fluidic-level synthesis and chip-level design to testing. Design automations are expected to alleviate the burden of manual optimization of bioassays, time-consuming chip designs, and costly testing and maintenance procedures. With the assistance of CAD tools, users can concentrate on the development and abstraction of nanoscale bioassays while leaving chip optimization and implementation details to CAD tools.},

Several different electrode patterns were tested under the same conditions. The results indicate that condensation on a cooled flat surface was increased using electrowetting (EW) by accelerating the slow coalescence process where smaller droplets join to form larger droplets and leave behind a dry surface for new droplets to form. A pattern consisting of 100-lm wide interdigitated electrodes separated by 100-lm gaps showed the fastest growth in droplet size. The largest droplets formed with such a pattern had approximately 30 times larger volume than the largest droplets formed on the surface when electrowetting was not applied. Finer patterns exhibited a larger overall condensation rate, where the electrowetting method showed up to a 56\% increase in overall water condensation.},

  abstract = {As in many low- and middle-income countries around the world, thousands of local communities in Southeast Asia rely on river water to sustain their livelihoods. However, poor water quality threatens the health of both humans and ecosystems. The aim of this review was to examine the available literature to investigate how health outcomes in Malaysia have been studied and reported as directly attributable to human infections from river water. Computer-aided searches from 10 electronic databases were undertaken, with searches limited to the English language and publication dates since January 2010. The literature search revealed that the predominant river water infections identified in Malaysia were bacterial (coliforms, Salmonella spp., typhoid, leptospirosis, melioidosis), viral (including dengue, hepatitis, enterovirus), parasitic infections including amoebiasis, giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis, helminth infections, Blastocystis infections and sarcocystosis. No studies were found that have attempted to evaluate the impact of water related infection on human health longitudinally. Moreover, the possibility of integrated water governance systems that could reduce infection and improve water quality, particularly for marginalized groups have not been discussed or studied. Several cross-sectional studies identified infections at a point in time, but large longitudinal data sets of water infection parameters and how they influence human health outcomes have not been reported. Using Malaysia as a demonstration case study, we suggest a number of recommendations based on using a systems approach to tackle the challenges involved in data collection and integration, which is central to the understanding, strategic planning and management of water-borne infections.},

  abstract = {The dielectrophoresis (DEP) data reported in the literature since 1994 for 22 different globular proteins is examined in detail. Apart from three cases, all of the reported protein DEP experiments employed a gradient field factor ∇E2m that is much smaller (in some instances by many orders of magnitude) than the \textasciitilde 4 × 1021 V2/m3 required, according to current DEP theory, to overcome the dispersive forces associated with Brownian motion. This failing results from the macroscopic Clausius–Mossotti (CM) factor being restricted to the range 1.0 {$>$} CM {$>$} −0.5. Current DEP theory precludes the protein’s permanent dipole moment (rather than the induced moment) from contributing to the DEP force. Based on the magnitude of the β-dispersion exhibited by globular proteins in the frequency range 1 kHz–50 MHz, an empirically derived molecular version of CM is obtained. This factor varies greatly in magnitude from protein to protein (e.g., \textasciitilde 37,000 for carboxypeptidase; \textasciitilde 190 for phospholipase) and when incorporated into the basic expression for the DEP force brings most of the reported protein DEP above the minimum required to overcome dispersive Brownian thermal effects. We believe this empirically-derived finding validates the theories currently being advanced by Matyushov and co-workers.},

The time-averaged effective electrical wetting tension, which is a function of AC frequency, is computed by integrating the Maxwell stress. The computed wetting tension is compared with the experimental result converted from the separately obtained contact-angle data. There is a good agreement between the two results at a low-frequency range and a qualitative agreement at a high-frequency range. Interestingly, the numerical results show that the electric-field strength decreases remarkably in the insulating layer near the TCL as the AC frequency increases. This decrease may account for the delay of the dielectric breakdown of an insulating layer in the AC case, which could be related to the contact-angle saturation phenomenon.},

As one of the frontend operations on digital microfluidic biochips, sample preparation plays an important role in biochemical assays and applications. For fast and high-throughput biochemical applications, it is critical to develop an automated design methodology for sample preparation. Prior work in this area does not provide solutions to the problem of design automation for sample preparation. Moreover, it is critical to ensure the correctness of droplets and recover from errors efficiently during sample preparation. Published work on error recovery is inefficient and impractical for sample preparation. Therefore, in this paper, we present an automated design methodology for sample preparation, including architectural synthesis, layout synthesis, and dynamic error recovery. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on real-life biochemical applications to demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency. Compared to prior work, the proposed algorithm can achieve up to 48.39\% reduction in sample preparation time.},

This paper proposes a dilution/mixing method with high utilization of intermediate droplets for preparing biochemical samples of multiple target concentrations on DMFBs. It provides the first solution to the problem of generating samples of multiple target concentrations. Unlike prior work in which the preparation of droplets of multiple target concentrations has to be carried out sequentially, this proposed approach takes a global view and all the target concentrations are processed concurrently. In addition, this is also the first approach that minimizes the number of waste droplets by utilizing intermediate droplets. Finally, the number of mixing steps can be reduced, leading to reduced completion time for sample preparation. The number of waste droplets is minimized by reducing the number of intermediate concentrations produced during sample preparation. Usable intermediate droplets are subsequently utilized to further reduce wastage. Simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve up to 71\% reduction in the number of waste droplets and up to 50\% reduction in sample preparation time.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) play an important role in the healthcare industry due to its advantages such as low-cost, portability, and efficiency. According to the recent market report, the growth of biochips market is twice than before. However, as the enormous business opportunities grow, piracy attacks, which are exploited by unscrupulous people to gain illegal profits, become a severe threat to DMFBs. To prevent piracy attacks, the conventional approach uses secret keys to perform authentication. Nevertheless, DMFBs only consist of electrodes to control the operations of droplets, and there are no memories and logic gates integrated on it to store secret keys. This makes designing secure defenses of DMFBs against piracy attacks more difficult. Thus, in this paper, we propose the first authentication method for piracy prevention of DMFBs based on a novel Physical Unclonable Function (PUF). The proposed PUF utilizes the inherent variation of electrodes on DMFBs to generate secret keys, so it does not require memory. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed PUF. Finally, we analyze the security of the proposed method against piracy attacks.},

  abstract = {In a biomedical diagnosis with a limited sample volume and low concentration, dropletbased microfluidics, also called digital microfluidics, becomes a very attractive approach. Previously, our group developed a magnetic-beads-based digital microfluidic immunoassay with a bead number of around 100, requiring less than 1 µL of sample volume to achieve a pg/mL level limit of detection (LOD). However, the bead number in each measurement was not the same, causing an unstable coefficient of variation (CV) in the calibration curve. Here, we investigated whether a fixed number of beads in this bead-based digital microfluidic immunoassay could provide more stable results. First, the bead screening chips were developed to extract exactly 100, 49, and 25 magnetic beads with diameters of less than 6 µm. Then, four calibration curves were established. One calibration curve was constructed by using varying bead numbers (50–160) in the process. The other three calibration curves used a fixed number of beads, (100, 49, and 25). The results indicated that the CVs for a fixed number of beads were evidently smaller than the CVs for varying bead numbers, especially in the range of 1 pg/mL to 100 pg/mL, where the CVs for 100 beads were less than 10\%. Furthermore, the calculated LOD, based on the composite calibration curves, could be reduced by three orders, from 3.0 pg/mL (for the unfixed bead number) to 0.0287 pg/mL (for 100 beads). However, when the bead numbers were too high (more than 500) or too low (25 or fewer), the bead manipulation for aggregation became more difficult in the magnetic-beads-based digital microfluidic immunoassay chip.},

  abstract = {The microfluidic technology for function microsphere synthesis has high control precision. However, the throughput is too low for industrial scale-up applications. Current scale-up design focuses on a multi-channel in 2D, in which the distribution uniformity parameter δ increases linearly, resulting in the deterioration of the flow distribution performance. The 3D modular scale-up strategy could greatly alleviate this problem, but no design principles have been developed yet. For the first time, this paper establishes the microfluidic 3D scale-up design criteria. Based on the modular design concept, the design method of 2D and 3D throughput scale-up parameters N and M, distribution uniformity parameters δ and β, and microchannel design parameter KR were proposed. The equivalent resistance coefficient was defined, and the influence of different parameters on a 2D array and 3D stack was analyzed. Furthermore, the error correction method was studied. It was found that the twostage scale-up process contradicted each other. A good scale-up performance of one stage led to the limitation of another stage. Increasing the resistance of each channel Ru could both increase the two-stage scale-up performance, which was an important factor. A single-module scale-up system with 8 channels in a single array and 10 arrays in a vertical stack, which had 80 channels in total, was designed and fabricated based on the proposed design criteria for generating Chitosan/TiO2 composite microspheres. The average particle size was 539.65 µm and CV value was about 3.59\%. The throughput was 480 ml h−1, which effectively increased the throughput scale and the product quality.},

  abstract = {A prototype aerosol detection system is presented that is designed to accurately and quickly measure the concentration of selected inorganic ions in the atmosphere. The aerosol detection system combines digital microfluidics technology, aerosol impaction and chemical detection integrated on the same chip. Target compounds are the major inorganic aerosol constituents: sulfate, nitrate and ammonium. The digital microfluidic system consists of top and bottom plates that sandwich a fluid layer. Nozzles for an inertial impactor are built into the top plate according to known, scaling principles. The deposited air particles are densely concentrated in well-defined deposits on the bottom plate containing droplet actuation electrodes of the chip in fixed areas. The aerosol collection efficiency for particles larger than 100 nm in diameter was higher than 95\%. After a collection phase, deposits are dissolved into a scanning droplet. Due to a sub-microliter droplet size, the obtained extract is highly concentrated. Droplets then pass through an air/oil interface on chip for colorimetric analysis by spectrophotometry using optical fibers placed between the two plates of the chip. To create a standard curve for each analyte, six different concentrations of liquid standards were chosen for each assay and dispensed from on-chip reservoirs. The droplet mixing was completed in a few seconds and the final droplet was transported to the detection position as soon as the mixing was finished. Limits of detection (LOD) in the final droplet were determined to be 11 ppm for sulfate and 0.26 ppm for ammonium. For nitrate, it was impossible to get stable measurements. The LOD of the on-chip measurements for sulfate was close to that obtained by an off-chip method using a Tecan spectrometer. LOD of the on-chip method for ammonium was about five times larger than what was obtained with the off-chip method. For the current impactor collection air flow (1 L/min) and 1 h collection time, the converted LODs in air were: 0.275 µg/m3 for sulfate, 6.5 ng/m3 for ammonium, sufficient for most ambient air monitoring applications.},

Each droplet can be used as one single bioreactor to compartmentalize a big material or biological population, so millions of droplets can be individually screened based on demand, while the sorting function could extract the droplets of interest to a separate pool from the main droplet library. In this paper, we reviewed droplet detection and active sorting methods that are currently still being widely used for high-through screening applications in microfluidic systems, including the latest updates regarding each technology.

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) have been widely used in biochemical experiments with high safety requirements. To ensure the reliability of the experiment, it is necessary to use test droplets to perform off-line and on-line testing for DMFBs. Previous random search algorithms are not fully combined with heuristic information, which increases the randomness of search progress and thus results in suboptimal test paths. To solve this problem, a new test path optimization method based on priority strategy and genetic algorithm is proposed, which reduces the blindness of test path search and improves the convergence effect of the random search algorithm. In this method, priority levels are randomly assigned to the edges of the chip test model. With the fluid constraints, a test droplet moves to the untraversed adjacent edge with the highest priority. If all adjacent edges have been traversed, Floyd algorithm is used to determine the shortest path from the test droplet to untraversed edges, and guide the test droplet to move along the shortest path. After determining the test path according to priority strategy, the priority level on the test path is optimized by genetic algorithm, so that the length of the path is gradually reduced by iteration. In this paper, a single test droplet is used to test given chips. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient, and the shortest path length is equal to the length of the Euler path, indicating that the shortest test path has reached the optimal value. Moreover, for the “deadlock” problem of droplets in on-line testing process, we also provide a solution by using backoff operation.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) is a mechanism that allows physical handling of liquids with only electrical signals, such as digitizing a liquid into tiny droplets and manipulating them on a chip, thus enabling “digital microfluidics”. As an elegantly simple platform free of pumps or valves, EWOD digital microfluidics has been attracting high research interest in the past two decades and has recently been transitioned to a few commercial products in displays and biochemistry. However, the number of labs utilizing this technology is still small, due to the difficulty in translating design intent to manufactured devices. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a cloud-based opensource EWOD cybermanufacturing ecosystem that enables an automatic translation from user requirements to manufactured digital microfluidics. The incubation cyber ecosystem is to be accessible to a wide range of end users, allowing researchers, entrepreneurs, students, and hobbyists alike to focus on their own ideas and applications without having to master the subtleties of EWOD engineering and manufacturing. This can be thought of as an “operating system” for EWOD community, similar to Windows and macOS for people with no computer hardware background. The proposed cyber ecosystem aims to ease the process of designing and eliminate the burden of fabricating EWOD chips so that the user pool is increased and more applications found for EWOD digital microfluidics.},

  abstract = {Interdigital capacitive sensors are applied in nondestructive testing and material property characterization of lowconductivity materials. The sensor performance is typically described based on the penetration depth of the electric field into the sample material, the sensor signal strength and its sensitivity. These factors all depend on the geometry and material properties of the sensor and sample. In this paper, a detailed analysis is provided, through finite element simulations, of the ways in which the sensor’s geometrical parameters affect its performance. The geometrical parameters include the number of digits forming the interdigital electrodes and the ratio of digit width to their separation. In addition, the influence of the presence or absence of a metal backplane on the sample is analyzed. Further, the effects of sensor substrate thickness and material on signal strength are studied. The results of the analysis show that it is necessary to take into account a trade-off between the desired sensitivity and penetration depth when designing the sensor. Parametric equations are presented to assist the sensor designer or nondestructive evaluation specialist in optimizing the design of a capacitive sensor.},

  abstract = {Two methods were studied for selectively measuring the on-chip absorbance of trace sulfate analytes in droplets on a digital microfluidics (DMF) platform. In one method, the direction of measurement was perpendicular to the flat upper and lower surfaces of the DMF platform (vertical), and in the second method, the measurement direction was parallel to the DMF platform surfaces (horizontal). The channel height or the vertical light path length was 0.24 mm, and the droplet diameter was 1 mm. The DMF system employed a silicone oil transport medium whereby a thin, non-uniform oil layer formed between the droplet and the upper/lower plates which was unstable, resulting in randomly formed local oil lenses. The mobile oil lenses caused vertical absorbance measurement errors and uncertainties. The effects of the oil lenses were verified by simulation. Horizontal absorbance measurements were taken with embedded optical fibers (0.2 mm in diameter) aligned over the bottom chip surface in contact with the sides of the droplet, resulting in a horizontal light path length approximately three times that of the vertical light path. Because no oil lenses could form on the droplet’s sides, the stability of repeated horizontal measurements outperformed repeated vertical measurements made on the same droplet and on multiple droplets actuated into the measurement positions. Comparisons were based on measurement standard deviations and limits of detection (LOD). The following LODs and measurement standard deviations were achieved for horizontal measurements of multiple sulfate concentrations in 1.5 µl droplets: 7 ppm for sulfate (0.3–2.7\%) and an R2 value of 0.957 from a least square data fit. Measurements on a commercial plate reader gave comparable results (200 µl liquid in each well, LOD equals 11 ppm, CV equals to 0.2–4\%), even though the absorbance path was larger (0.7 mm). This LOD value means that the chip could detect 10.5 ng of sulfate. LOD values on vertical measurements were also similar, but large measurement errors from numerous outlier points yielded an R2 value of 0.735 and large average measurement standard deviations (36\%).},

This paper provides an overview of DMFBs and describes emerging CAD tools for the automated synthesis and optimization of DMFB designs, from fluidic-level synthesis to chip-level design. Design automations are expected to relieve the design burden of manual optimization of bioassays, time-consuming chip designs, and costly testing and maintenance procedures.

  abstract = {Designs for pin-constrained digital microfluidic biochips (PDMFBs) are receiving much attention because they simplify chip fabrication and packaging, and reduce product cost. To reduce the pin count, broadcast addressing, by minimally grouping electrode sets with non-conflict signal merging, has emerged as a promising solution. Nevertheless, naive signal merging has the potential to cause excessive electrode actuations, which has been reported to have direct and adverse effect on chip reliability. According to recent studies, reliability is an important attribute for PDMFBs particularly developed for medical applications as it directly affects the final medical decision making. However, no research findings have been reported on the reliability problem in pin-constrained designs. To make PDMFBs more feasible for practical applications, we propose in this paper the first matchingbased reliability-oriented broadcast-addressing algorithm for PDMFBs. We identify the factors that affect reliability and incorporate into the design-technique attributes that enhance reliability. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {In point-of-care testing (POCT), tests are performed near patients and results are given rapidly for timely clinical decisions. Immunodiagnostic assays are one of the most important analyses for detecting and quantifying proteinbased biomarkers. However, existing POCT immunodiagnostics mainly rely on the lateral flow assay (LFA), which has limited sensitivity or quantification capability. Although other immunodiagnostic assays, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), offer more sensitive and quantitative results, they require complex liquid manipulations that are difficult to implement in POCT settings by conventional means. Here, we show the development of DropLab, an automated sample-in-answer-out POCT immunodiagnostic platform based on magnetic digital microfluidic (MDM) technology. DropLab performs microbead-based ELISA in droplets to offer more sensitive and quantitative testing results. The intricate liquid manipulations required for ELISA are accomplished by controlling droplets with magnetic microbeads using MDM technology, which enables us to achieve full automation and easy operations with DropLab. Four ELISAs (the sample in triplicates and a negative control) can be run in parallel on the thermoformed disposable chip, which greatly improves the throughput and accuracy compared to those of other POCT immunodiagnostic devices. DropLab was validated by measuring two protein targets and one antibody target. The testing results showed that the limit of detection (LOD) of DropLab matched that of the conventional ELISA in a microwell plate. DropLab brings MDM one step closer to being a viable medical technology that is ready for real-world POCT applications.},

The first member of the family, Ti               3               C               2               T               x               , was reported in 2011. Since then MXenes have opened up an exciting new field in 2D inorganic functional materials by virtue of their intrinsic electronic conductivity, superior hydrophilicity, rich surface chemistry and layered structure, as evidenced by the fact that the number of papers on MXenes has increased exponentially. The unique properties and ease of processing have positioned them as promising materials for a variety of applications including energy storage, especially for supercapacitors. In this review, we aim to summarize the current advances in MXene research on supercapacitors. We begin by reviewing various fabrication routes and their influence on the structure and surface chemistry of MXenes. The structure, properties, stability, and species of layered MXenes are then introduced. The focus then turns to the capacitive energy-storage mechanisms and the factors determining the electrochemical behavior and performance in supercapacitors. Besides, various types of MXene-based supercapacitors are summarized to highlight the significance of MXenes in constructing energy storage devices. Finally, challenges and prospects in this booming field are proposed to promote further development of MXenes in supercapacitors.},

While microfluidic devices have shown their capability in point-of-care applications, some of them face the challenge in on-chip sample preparation, such as DNA extraction from blood samples, prior to the diagnosis. Although digital microfluidic (DMF) eliminates the need of complicated fluidic actuation components and draws great attentions as a promising Lab-on-a-Chip platform, its capability in DNA extraction has been limitedly shown. Herein, we develop a protocol on a DMF platform for DNA extraction. As the protocol contains blood, magnetic beads, a variety of liquids, and complicated steps, it was implemented in a sequence of droplet operations with our proposed washing/droplet-separation strategy. Our on-chip extraction protocol was conducted with room-temperature incubations and much less washing cycles. The results were confirmed by using SYBR-Green dye staining and gel electrophoresis. Therefore, the DMF device was shown to permit on-chip DNA extraction with fewer sample/reagent consumption and shorter operation time.},

In order to improve the driving performance of the device, this paper is aimed at the design modeling, simulation verification and physical preparation of the electrode shape of the EWOD device. The theoretical model is modified mainly around the contact angle saturation of the droplet and the structural parameters on the base plate to make it closer to the actual test results. And the driving ability of the designed electrode shape is verified by simulation and device preparation. The results show that the electrode shape designed in this paper has improved the droplet driving ability by about 17\% compared with the typical electrode shape at 25 V DC voltage. In conclusion, The electrode shape designed in this paper not only improves the driving capability for regular-sized droplets, but also has excellent driving capability for small-sized droplets.},

These are the real state of the quality of a river and allow the detection of both short-term events and long-term changes. At the international level there are specialized systems that monitor water in terms of its pollution. Some of them are made only for pollutants from the agricultural sector, for example the flow of nutrients from rivers [1, 2]; others focused on assessing the ecological status of rivers or the impact of river pollution on drinking water. Most studies have been performed on in-situ sensor placement [3, 4]. However, precision water monitoring devices, such as chemical analyzers, are not widely used due to high investment and maintenance costs, as they are used to monitor river basins through analysis stations of national agencies. These types of analyzers are, for example, for determining the amount of phosphorus in water. However, ammonium (NH4-N) and organic carbon (Total Organic Carbon - TOC) are of significant relevance to the chemical and ecological status of rivers, as well as to the identification of their sources.},

Over the past decade, a number of microfluidics design-automation techniques have been developed for on-chip droplet manipulation. However, these methods overlook the myriad complexities of biomolecular protocols and they have yet to make a significant impact in biochemistry/microbiology research. A paradigm shift in biochip design automation and a “phase transition” in research are clearly needed to bridge this gap between microfluidics and microbiology. In this paper, we explain how researchers from design-automation and embedded systems can play a key role in this transition. We present a new synthesis flow that uses realistic models of biomolecular protocols and cyberphysical adaptation to address real-world microbiology applications. We also present a list of metrics that can be used for the assessment of designautomation techniques for microbiology applications.},

The correlation between design parameters and frequency behavior in coplanar impedance sensors are described. CoventorWare software was used to model the biological medium loaded interdigital sensor in three dimensions to measure its electrical impedance. Complete system simulation by a finite element method (FEM) was used for sensor sensitivity optimization. The influence of geometrical parameters (number of fingers, width of the electrodes) on the impedance spectroscopy of the biological medium was studied. The simulation results are in agreement with the theoretical equations of optimization. Thus, it is possible to design a priori such sensor by taking into account the biological medium of interest that will load the sensor.},

  abstract = {We present a tunable-angle wedge ultrasound transducer for improved control of microparticle acoustophoresis in a microfluidic chip. The transducer is investigated by analyzing the pattern of aligned particles and induced acoustic energy density while varying the transducer geometry, transducer coupling angle, and transducer actuation method (single-frequency actuation or frequency-modulation actuation). The energy-density analysis is based on measuring the transmitted light intensity through a microfluidic channel filled with a suspension of 5 μm diameter beads and the results with the tunable-angle transducer are compared with the results from actuation by a standard planar transducer in order to decouple the influence from change in coupling angle and change in transducer geometry. We find in this work that the transducer coupling angle is the more important parameter compared to the concomitant change in geometry and that the coupling angle may be used as an additional tuning parameter for improved acoustophoretic control with single-frequency actuation. Further, we find that frequency-modulation actuation is suitable for diminishing such tuning effects and that it is a robust method to produce uniform particle patterns with average acoustic energy densities comparable to those obtained using single-frequency actuation.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Phosphorus is an essential element for water quality control. Excessive amounts of phosphorus causes algal bloom in water, which leads to eutrophication and a decline in water quality. It is necessary to maintain the optimum amount of phosphorus present. During the last decades, various studies have been conducted to determine phosphorus content in water. In this study, we present a comprehensive overview of colorimetric, electrochemical, fluorescence, microfluidic, and remote sensing technologies for the measurement of phosphorus in water, along with their working principles and limitations. Results: The colorimetric techniques determine the concentration of phosphorus through the use of colorgenerating reagents. This is specific to a single chemical species and inexpensive to use. The electrochemical techniques operate by using a reaction of the analyte of interest to generate an electrical signal that is proportional to the sample analyte concentration. They show a good linear output, good repeatability, and a high detection capacity. The fluorescence technique is a kind of spectroscopic analysis method. The particles in the sample are excited by irradiation at a specific wavelength, emitting radiation of a different wavelength. It is possible to use this for quantitative and qualitative analysis of the target analyte. The microfluidic techniques incorporate several features to control chemical reactions in a micro device of low sample volume and reagent consumption. They are cheap and rapid methods for the detection of phosphorus in water. The remote sensing technique analyzes the sample for the target analyte using an optical technique, but without direct contact. It can cover a wider area than the other techniques mentioned in this review. Conclusion: It is concluded that the sensing technologies reviewed in this study are promising for rapid detection of phosphorus in water. The measurement range and sensitivity of the sensors have been greatly improved recently.},

The effect of graphite powder mass fraction on the magnitude of the potentiometric response of the sensor was systematically verified using a batch-mode and a flow injection measurement setup. Under steady-state conditions, the paper electrode provided a Nernstian response of 57.30 mV/pNH4 over the concentration range of 10−5 M to 10−1 M with a detection limit of 4.8 × 10−6 M, while the analytical performance of the array in flow mode showed a narrower linear range (10−4 M to 10−1 M; 60.91 mV/pNH4 slope) with a LOD value of 5.6 × 10−5 M. The experimental results indicate that the prepared electrode exhibited high stability and fast response to different molar concentrations of ammonium chloride solutions. The pHresponse of the paper NH4-ISE was also investigated, and the sensor remained stable in the pH range of 2.5–8.5. The potentiometric sensor presented here is simple, lightweight and inexpensive, with a potential application for in-situ analysis of environmental water samples.},

  abstract = {Studying the dynamic behavior of droplets is of great importance in the electrowetting phenomena. However, despite the widespread use of non-Newtonian fluids in industry and daily life including medicine, food, petroleum, environmental biomass, and lab on a chip, most studies have focused on Newtonian fluids. In this study, a power-law fluid is considered as a typical example of non-Newtonian fluids and its dynamic behavior is investigated within a microchannel, and the results are compared with those of the Newtonian fluids. Both the grooved and nongrooved substrates are considered. For this purpose, the governing equations for the two phase fluid flow are solved using the finite element method, and the phase field method is used for interface tracking. We show that for four types of the considered grooves in the microchannel, different changes in the fluid dynamics are observed. When the droplets pass over the grooves, the velocity decreases and the pressure drop increases. These behaviors are intensified when the size of the grooves increases. In the shear thinning fluids, the velocity reduction is larger and even causes the drop to stop. However, in the shear thickening fluids, the velocity reduction is smaller, and the droplets can cross the grooves. After the grooves, the velocity of the droplets increases suddenly. Finally, it is shown that the time of separation of a droplet in the splitting process completely depends on the fluid type, which is much less in the shear thinning fluids compared to the shear thickening types.},

  abstract = {We describe the design and performance of a portable closed electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) system for digital microfluidics applications. The system is cost-effective and is capable of controlling the motion of one or more droplets under the influence of an asymmetric electric field. Using polypropylene (commercial cello tape) as a dielectric layer with GlacoTM spray to create a hydrophobic surface lowers device fabrication cost. For the first time, a superhydrophobic GlacoTM layer (equilibrium contact angle * 150°) is used for the EWOD device fabrication. The device has four modules that are designed to provide a high actuation voltage in the range of 5–300 VDC over the array of electrode pads. Given a large enough electrode array over the lower surface, the effect of the applied potential of the top electrode on droplet motion is studied via numerical simulation and is shown to be insignificant. This result further helps in simplifying the fabrication process. The user-friendly interface that defines droplet motion is designed using Qt, a cross-platform framework that is used as a graphical toolkit and an open-source image processing software in Raspberry Pi. Two types of closed EWOD configurations are developed to demonstrate their features in terms of moving and merging multiple droplets. For the designs implemented, the greatest speed of droplet movement at 295 VDC was measured to be 60 mm/s. Additional features of the device include calculation of the real-time mixing index and a thermal management module for temperature control. The simplicity of design and low-cost makes the device attractive for studying electrically induced drop motion on one end to a biomedical diagnostic test kit, on the other.},

  abstract = {As a result of increased water demand and water pollution, both surface water and groundwater quantity and quality are of major concern worldwide. In particular, the presence of nutrients and heavy metals in water is a serious threat to human health. The initial step for the effective management of surface waters and groundwater requires regular, continuous monitoring of water quality in terms of contaminant distribution and source identification. Because of this, there is a need for screening and monitoring measurements of these compounds at contaminated areas. However, traditional monitoring techniques are typically still based on laboratory analyses of representative field-collected samples; this necessitates considerable effort and expense, and the sample may change before analysis. Furthermore, currently available equipment is so large that it cannot usually be made portable. Alternatively, lab chip and electrochemical sensing-based portable monitoring systems appear well suited to complement standard analytical methods for a number of environmental monitoring applications. In addition, this type of portable system could save tremendous amounts of time, reagent, and sample if it is installed at contaminated sites such as Superfund sites (the USA’s worst toxic waste sites) and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) facilities or in rivers and lakes. Accordingly, state-of-the-art monitoring equipment is necessary for accurate assessments of water quality. This article reviews details on our development of these lab-on-a-chip (LOC) sensors.},

Hence, water quality monitoring has become a prime activity worldwide. The available monitoring procedures are inadequate as most of them require expensive instrumentation, longer processing time, tedious processes, and skilled lab technicians. Therefore, a portable, sensitive, and selective sensor with in situ and continuous water quality monitoring is the current necessity. In this context, microfluidics is the promising technology to fulfill this need due to its advantages such as faster reaction times, better process control, reduced waste generation, system compactness and parallelization, reduced cost, and disposability.

The microheater has a thickness of \textasciitilde{} 100 nm to \textasciitilde{} 100 μm and offers a temperature range up to 1900℃ with precise control. In recent years, due to the escalating demand for flexible electronics, thin-film microheaters have emerged as an imperative research area. This review provides an overview of recent advancements in microheater as well as analyses different microheater designs, materials, fabrication, and temperature control. In addition, the applications of microheaters in gas sensing, biological, and electrical and mechanical sectors are emphasized. Moreover, the maximum temperature, voltage, power consumption, response time, and heating rate of each microheater are tabulated. Finally, we addressed the specific key considerations for designing and fabricating a microheater as well as the importance of microheater integration in COVID-19 diagnostic kits. This review thereby provides general guidelines to researchers to integrate microheater in micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), which may pave the way for developing rapid and large-scale SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic kits in resource-constrained clinical or home-based environments.},

This novel electrokinetic technique has successfully been employed in many miniaturized systems for the manipulation and detection of microbes. This review article depicts the application of dielectrophoresis for the monitoring of microorganisms in microfluidic devices for environmental applications. The research studies described here are mainly conceived for water‐ and air‐monitoring assessments, and are classified considering the target aimed to detect, concentrate, and/or separate, including chemical and toxicant agents, and microorganisms ranging from virus to protozoa. Dielectrophoresis has also played an important role in biofilm formation studies. This review article comprises mainly studies published from 2000 to present. Even in this relatively short time frame, there have been many significant contributions of this powerful and nascent technique related to environmental monitoring; thus, unveiling its great potential for future research directions.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) chips have become the most popular actuators, particularly for droplet-based digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) systems. In order to enable the electrical manipulations, wire routing is a key problem in designing EWOD chips. Unlike traditional very-large-scaleintegration (VLSI) routing problems, in addition to routing-path establishment on signal pins, the pin-constrained EWOD-chip routing problem must address the issue of signal sharing for pincount reduction under a practical constraint posed by a limited pin-count supply. Moreover, EWOD-chip designs might incur several obstacles in the routing region due to embedded devices for specific fluidic protocols. However, no existing work considers the EWOD-chip routing with obstacles and, therefore, lots of manual design efforts are involved. To remedy this insufficiency, we propose in this paper the first routing algorithm for pinconstrained EWOD chips with obstacle avoidance. The proposed algorithm, based on effective integer-linear-programming (ILP) formulation as well as efficient routing framework, can achieve high routability with a low design complexity. Experimental results based on real-life chips with obstacles demonstrate the high routability of proposed algorithm for pin-constrained EWOD chips with obstacle avoidance.},

  abstract = {Identification and quantification of foodborne pathogens are becoming increasingly important to public health and food safety since the majority of foodborne illnesses and deaths are caused by pathogenic bacteria.           ,                             Identification and quantification of foodborne pathogens are becoming increasingly important to public health and food safety since the majority of foodborne illnesses and deaths are caused by pathogenic bacteria. Conventional methods for foodborne pathogen detection are time-consuming and laborious due to the requirement of a series of processes including cell enrichment, isolation and morphological identification. Therefore the demand for rapid, sensitive, inexpensive and convenient approaches to detect foodborne pathogenic bacteria has emerged in recent years. Among the new approaches, microfluidic chip-based detection has generated growing interest because of the miniaturized size, improved sensitivity and reduced detection time of the devices. In addition, the applications of nanomaterials and magnetic microbeads have further facilitated target recognition and signal transduction processes in microfluidic pathogen detection. The lab-on-a-chip technique has developed into an alternative to conventional methods to detect foodborne pathogens owing to its potentials to offer desired sensitivity and to respond in a short test time. Most recently, smartphones and 3-D printing technologies are attracting growing attention for enhanced detection performances. This paper reviews the most recent developments and trends in miniaturized microfluidic devices based on different recognition principles and signal amplification methods to detect foodborne pathogens. In particular, emphasis will be put on those that offer both rapid detection result turn-around and ultra-low detection limit of 10               2               to 10               3               cells per mL or even single-cell detection.},

This paper proposes a novel capacitance-based droplet sensing system for thin-film transistor DMF. The proposed circuit features a distinctive inner and outer dual-pixel electrode structure, integrating droplet driving and sensing functionalities. Discharge occurs exclusively at the inner electrode during droplet sensing, effectively addressing droplet perturbation in existing sensing circuits. The circuit employs a novel fan-shaped structure of thin-film transistors. Simulation results show that it can provide a 48 V pixel voltage and demonstrate a sensing voltage difference of over 10 V between deionized water and silicone oil, illustrating its proficiency in droplet driving and accurate sensing. The stability of threshold voltage drift and temperature was also verified for the circuit. The design is tailored for integration into active matrix electrowetting-on-dielectric (AM-EWOD) chips, offering a novel approach to achieve precise closed-loop control of droplets.},

  abstract = {Electrochemical sensing provides a new way for miniaturization and low cost of equipment. Meanwhile, digital microfluidic (DMF) technology is making lab-on-chip a reality. The two technologies are essential in the point-of-care area. Electrochemical detection on electrodes and DMF-based droplet driving electrode realize their respective functions by means of electrical signals. In terms of working mode, it seems to have certain similarity, and electrochemical sensing seems to be more suitable for integrating digital microfluidic systems. We thus integrated electrochemical sensing on an active matrix (AM) DMF system. As a common transparent conductive glass, indium tin oxide (ITO) has been widely used as the top plate of the digital microfluidic chip. In this work, we used ITO glass with patterned interdigital electrodes as the top plate of the AM-DMF chip. We achieved on-chip droplet volume detection by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). We also proposed a novel sample dilution method on the DMF chip. It takes only 30 seconds to dilute solutions into 4 different concentrations. We then analyzed droplet samples of different concentrations with EIS method. And the correlation coefficient of the fitted curve is as high as 0.9964. In conclusion, EIS is a powerful detection technology for fast, high-integration and low-cost detection on DMF system. The integration of EIS and DMF can be used in various biochemical analyses in the future.},

Accordingly, we realized an on-chip magnetic bead chemiluminescence immunoassay for parallel detection with the “one-to-three” technique. With the help of the generated micro droplets, we were able to retain the magnetic beads by a significantly reduced magnetic force. We have shown the detection of five B-type natriuretic peptide analyte samples on a single chip for around 10 minutes.

The electromechanical force does not depend upon field-mediated changes of the contact angle; it is operative even if the liquid surface is constrained. Forces on liquid volumes may be determined using capacitance or the Maxwell stress tensor with no reference made to liquid surface profiles.

This was confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Interestingly, the reproducibility of the standard potential of the conditioned SC-ISE was significantly improved from E0 ± 35.3 mV to E0 ± 3.5 mV simply by adding the SR coating on top of the plasticized PVC based K+-selective membrane. Moreover, the adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA) was significantly reduced at the SR coated ion-selective membrane. Thus, the addition of a SR coating on a plasticized PVC ion-selective membrane seems to be a feasible method to improve the analytical performance and to reduce the biofouling of potentiometric ion sensors.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting on dielectric-based digital microfluidic platforms (EWOD-DMF) have a potential to impact point-of-care diagnostics. Conventionally, EWOD-DMF platforms are manufactured in cleanrooms by expert technicians using costly and time consuming micro-nanofabrication processes such as optical lithography, depositions and etching. However, such high-end microfabrication facilities are extremely challenging to establish in resource-poor and low-income countries, due to their high capital investment and operating costs. This makes the fabrication of EWOD-DMF platforms extremely challenging in low-income countries, where such platforms are most needed for many applications such as point-of-care testing applications. To address this challenge, we present a low-cost and simple fabrication procedure for EWOD-DMF electrode arrays, which can be performed anywhere with a commercial office inkjet printer without the need of expensive cleanroom facilities. We demonstrate the utility of our platform to move and mix droplets of different reagents and physiologically conductive buffers, thereby showing its capability to potentially perform a variety of biochemical assays. By combining our low-cost, inkjet-printed EWOD-DMF platform with smartphone imaging technology and a compact control system for droplet manipulation, we also demonstrate a portable and hand-held device which can be programmed to potentially perform a variety of biochemical assays.},

This review (with 171 references) discusses recent advances in three types of porous nanostructures that have shown remarkable potential for RT gas sensing. The first group comprises hierarchical oxide nanostructures (mainly oxides of Sn, Ni, Zn, W, In, La, Fe, Co). The second group comprises graphene and its derivatives (graphene, graphene oxides, reduced graphene oxides, and their composites with metal oxides and noble metals). The third group comprises 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (mainly sulfides of Mo, W, Sn, Ni, also in combination with metal oxides). They all have been found to enable RT sensing of gases such as NOx, NH3, H2, SO2, CO, and of vapors such as of acetone, formaldehyde or methanol. Attractive features also include high selectivity and sensitivity, long-term stability and affordable costs. Strengths and limitations of these materials are highlighted, and prospects with respect to the development of new materials to overcome existing limitations are discussed.},

Among the designs, injectable forms of biomedical electronics are explored for accurate and safe targeting of deep‐seated body organs. Here, the classes of biomedical electronics and tools that have high aspect ratio structures designed to be injected or inserted into internal organs for minimally invasive monitoring and therapy are reviewed. Compared with devices in bulky or planar formats, the long shaft‐like forms of implantable devices are easily placed in the organs with minimized outward protrusions via injection or insertion processes. Adding flexibility to the devices also enables effortless insertions through complex biological cavities, such as the cochlea, and enhances chronic reliability by complying with natural body movements, such as the heartbeat. Diverse types of such injectable implants developed for different organs are reviewed and the electronic, optoelectronic, piezoelectric, and microfluidic devices that enable stimulations and measurements of site‐specific regions in the body are discussed. Noninvasive penetration strategies to deliver the miniscule devices are also considered. Finally, the challenges and future directions associated with deep body biomedical electronics are explained.},

  abstract = {Interdigitated Electrodes (IDEs) based sensor in comb-like electrodes structure is also an attractive candidate in gas sensor and biosensor applications, owing to its simple structural design. The sensitivity can be improved based on geometric parameters of the sensor. Hence, in this paper, we study the physical model of the IDEs-based sensor and concern with its geometrical parameters (gap sizes, number of fingers and width of fingers) based on the finite element simulations using COMSOL Multiphysics. The simulation results were used to show the electrical field that generated by the IDEs and compare to other to find the optimum design. Based on the results, the relationship between the geometric parameters and the IDEs performances are studied. The simulation results show that the higher electric fields are generated with the smaller gap size and smaller width of fingers. Besides that, the results show that the gap size and the width of fingers affect the IDEs performance significantly compared to the number of fingers. The IDE with the design 18 fingers, 0.1 mm gap size between fingers and 0.1 mm width of the finger is the optimum design which generates 30.6 kV/m average of electric field magnitude.},

  abstract = {With the rapid growth of emerging point-of-use (POU)/point-of-care (POC) detection technologies, miniaturized sensors for the real-time detection of gases and airborne pathogens have become essential to fight pollution, emerging contaminants, and pandemics. However, the low-cost development of miniaturized gas sensors without compromising selectivity, sensitivity, and response time remains challenging. Microfluidics is a promising technology that has been exploited for decades to overcome such limitations, making it an excellent candidate for POU/POC. However, microfluidic-based gas sensors remain a nascent field. In this review, the evolution of microfluidic gas sensors from basic electronic techniques to more advanced optical techniques such as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy to detect analytes is documented in detail. This paper focuses on the various detection methodologies used in microfluidic-based devices for detecting gases and airborne pathogens. Non-continuous microfluidic devices such as bubble/droplet-based microfluidics technology that have been employed to detect gases and airborne pathogens are also discussed. The selectivity, sensitivity, advantages/disadvantages vis-a-vis response time, and fabrication costs for all the microfluidic sensors are tabulated. The microfluidic sensors are grouped based on the target moiety, such as air pollutants such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, and airborne pathogens such as E. coli and SARS-CoV-2. The possible application scenarios for the various microfluidic devices are critically examined.},

Advances in sensor fabrication methods, scalable material synthesis, microelectronics, flexible electronics, and wireless communication have enabled the evolution of biosensing devices from traditional hospital-centric systems to home-centric solutions, suitable for use by non-experts to analyze early signs of diseases. Despite these advancements, key challenges remain, including scalability, material durability, power management, and seamless integration of biosensor components into user-friendly platforms. The translation of these technologies involves strategies to overcome these challenges, such as developing cost-effective manufacturing methods and optimizing device design for real-world applications. Furthermore, the integration of these devices with the Internet-of-Things (IoT), Internet-ofMedical-Things (IoMT), artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) algorithms has demonstrated breakthrough technological solutions for healthcare management, disease prognosis, and patient care. However, potential risks such as data security vulnerabilities, privacy concerns, and regulatory challenges must be addressed to ensure safe and ethical deployment of these technologies. Herein, we provide an in-depth analysis of the evolution of conventional electrochemical biosensors into miniaturized, integrated devices, focusing on their potential for better healthcare management and highlighting associated technical, regulatory, and ethical challenges. We also highlight key aspects of 6th generation sensing technology. Additionally, the role of IoT and AI-assisted technologies is critically discussed, presenting both their transformative benefits and the risks they pose in the biomedical field.},

  abstract = {Microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (mPADs) have attracted much attention over the past decade because they offer clinicians the ability to deliver point-of-care testing and onsite analysis. Many of the advantages of mPADs, however, are limited to work in a laboratory setting due to the difficulties of processing data when using electronic devices in the field. This review focuses on the use of mPADs that have the potential to work without batteries or with only small and portable devices such as smartphones, timers, or miniaturized detectors. The mPADs that can be operated without batteries are, in general, those that allow the visual judgment of analyte concentrations via readouts that are measured in time, distance, count, or text. Conversely, a smartphone works as a camera to permit the capture and processing of an image that digitizes the color intensity produced by the reaction of an analyte with a colorimetric reagent. Miniaturized detectors for electrochemical, fluorometric, chemiluminescence, and electrochemiluminescence methods are also discussed, although some of them require the use of a laptop computer for operation and data processing.},

  abstract = {Electrochemical sensors play a significant role in detecting chemical ions, molecules, and pathogens in water and other applications. These sensors are sensitive, portable, fast, inexpensive, and suitable for online and in-situ measurements compared to other methods. They can provide the detection for any compound that can undergo certain transformations within a potential window. It enables applications in multiple ion detection, mainly since these sensors are primarily non-specific. In this paper, we provide a survey of electrochemical sensors for the detection of water contaminants, i.e., pesticides, nitrate, nitrite, phosphorus, water hardeners, disinfectant, and other emergent contaminants (phenol, estrogen, gallic acid etc.). We focus on the influence of surface modification of the working electrodes by carbon nanomaterials, metallic nanostructures, imprinted polymers and evaluate the corresponding sensing performance. Especially for pesticides, which are challenging and need special care, we highlight biosensors, such as enzymatic sensors, immunobiosensor, aptasensors, and biomimetic sensors. We discuss the sensors’ overall performance, especially concerning real-sample performance and the capability for actual field application.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the past and recent studies on thermocapillarity in relation to microfluidics. The role of thermocapillarity as the change of surface tension due to temperature gradient in developing Marangoni flow in liquid films and conclusively bubble and drop actuation is discussed. The thermocapillary-driven mass transfer (the so-called Benard-Marangoni effect) can be observed in liquid films, reservoirs, bubbles and droplets that are subject to the temperature gradient. Since the contribution of a surface tension-driven flow becomes more prominent when the scale becomes smaller as compared to a pressure-driven flow, microfluidic applications based on thermocapillary effect are gaining attentions recently. The effect of thermocapillarity on the flow pattern inside liquid films is the initial focus of this review. Analysis of the relation between evaporation and thermocapillary instability approves the effect of Marangoni flow on flow field inside the drop and its evaporation rate. The effect of thermocapillary on producing Marangoni flow inside drops and liquid films, leads to actuation of drops and bubbles due to the drag at the interface, mass conservation, and also gravity and buoyancy in vertical motion. This motion can happen inside microchannels with a closed multiphase medium, on the solid substrate as in solid/liquid interaction, or on top of a carrier liquid film in open microfluidic systems. Various thermocapillary-based microfluidic devices have been proposed and developed for different purposes such as actuation, sensing, trapping, sorting, mixing, chemical reaction, and biological assays throughout the years. A list of the thermocapillary based microfluidic devices along with their characteristics, configurations, limitations, and improvements are presented in this review.},

  abstract = {Microfluidic devices have opened new opportunities for functional material chemical synthesis in a few applications. The screening of microfluidic synthesis processes is an urgent task of the experimental process in terms of automation and intellectualization. This study proposes a methodology and software for extracting the morphological and dynamic characteristics of generated monodisperse droplets from video data streams obtained from a digital microscope. For this purpose, the paper considers an approach to generating an extended feature space characterizing the process of droplet generation using a microfluidic device based on the creation of synthetic image datasets. YOLOv7 was used as an algorithm for detecting objects in the images. When training this algorithm, the values in the test dataset mAP@0.5 0.996 were obtained. The algorithms proposed for image processing and analysis implement the basic functionality to extract the morphological and dynamic characteristics of monodisperse droplets in the synthesis process. Laboratory validation and verification of the software demonstrated high results of the identification of key characteristics of the monodisperse droplets generated by the microfluidic device with the average deviation from the real values not exceeding 8\%.},

The limited ability to reproduce crucial features of the microenvironment, such as surrounding fluid flow and dynamic changes in biochemical stimuli, severely limits the types of experiments that can be carried out. Current equipment to achieve this, such as syringe and peristaltic pumps, is expensive, large, difficult to program and has limited potential for scalability. Here, we present a new pumping platform that is open-source, low-cost, modular, scalable, fully-programmable and easy to assemble that can be incorporated into cell culture systems to better recapitulate physiological environments. By controlling two commercially available piezoelectric pumps using a Raspberry Pi Zero microcontroller, the system is capable of producing arbitrary dynamic flow profiles with reliable flow rates ranging from 1 to 3000 mL/min as specified by an easily programmable Python-based script. We validated the accuracy of the flow rates, the use of time-varying profiles, and the practicality of the system by creating repeatable dynamic concentration profiles using a 3D-printed static micromixer.},

Such investigations are important in numerous applications and fields of research, including electrochemical synthesis and deposition of materials, such as metals and conducting polymers, corrosion protection analysis, investigation of molecule-surface interactions, and research on batteries and fuel cells. In recent years, advances in nanotechnology have led to a rise in the use of EIS in chemical and bio-sensing. Areas such as molecular diagnostics and healthcare can greatly benefit from this novel technology, which includes low-cost, rapid response measurements that can be done by non-experts at the point of care. For new entrants, the depth of knowledge and breadth of EIS and its many applications can be rather daunting. This article therefore serves as a tutorial on basic EIS theory, whilst highlighting new applications in advanced bio-sensing. The tutorial begins with a theoretical overview, including electrical AC impedance, formation and structure of electrical double layers at liquid solid-interfaces and equivalent circuit models used to represent interfacial phenomena. This is followed by an introduction to bio-sensing and a review of recent research highlights on resistive and capacitive biosensors based on nanogap electrodes, especially those having novel applications from DNA detection to nanoparticle capturing. Lastly, the article highlights a recent new breakthrough on how the combination of nanogap electrodes with label-free methods, such as aptamer functionalized surfaces, can make capacitive sensors with extremely high sensitivity and specificity.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic biochips enable a higher degree of automation in laboratory procedures in biochemistry and molecular biology and have received significant attention in the recent past. Their design is usually conducted in several stages with routing being a particularly critical challenge. Previously proposed solutions for this design step suffer from two issues: They are mainly of heuristic nature and usually assume that the blockages to be bypassed are present the entire time. In contrast, we present a methodology which exploits the fact that blockages are often only present at certain intervals. At the same time, our approach guarantees exact solutions, i.e. always determines a routing with a minimal number of time steps. Experimental results show that, despite the huge complexity, optimal results can be achieved in reasonable run-time and that the consideration of temporary blockages indeed significantly improves the routing results.},

  abstract = {Advances in microfluidic technologies have led to the emergence of Digital Microfluidic Biochips (DMFBs), which are capable of automating laboratory procedures in biochemistry and molecular biology. During the design and use of these devices, droplet routing represents a particularly critical challenge. Here, various design tasks have to be addressed for which, depending on the corresponding scenario, different solutions are available. However, all these developments eventually result in an “inflation” of different design approaches for routing of DMFBs – many of them addressing a very dedicated routing task only. In this work, we propose a comprehensive routing methodology which (1) provides one (generic) solution capable of addressing a variety of different design tasks, (2) employs a “push-button”-scheme that requires no (manual) composition of partial results, and (3) guarantees minimality e.g., with respect to the number of timesteps or the number of required control pins. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the benefits of the solution, i.e., the applicability for a wide range of design tasks as well as improvements compared to specialized solutions presented in the past.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting has the potential to be applied to steering and concentrating sunlight using liquid lenses. However, the performance of electrowetting devices depends on the careful selection/ fabrication of their constituent dielectric material. The dielectric material should have high optical transparency, chemical stability, high relative permittivity, be relatively thin and have a high breakdown voltage. Recent studies noted that inorganic dielectric materials such as SiO2 are more suitable for beam steering compared to organic dielectric materials such as fluoropolymers or parylene C for example. When optical transmission is not required, electrowetting devices are fabricated by thermally growing SiO2 on top of silicon wafers. However, this deposition method is not suitable for beam steering electrowetting devices as the silicon substrate is not optically transparent. In this paper, we investigated the performance of SiO2 as a dielectric material for beam steering electrowetting devices. Specifically, we measured the contact angle modulation capability of SiO2 produced by electron-beam and sputtering deposition methods and correlated the results with morphological defects of the SiO2 layer introduced by the deposition methods. We investigated the effect of annealing and the performance with ionic and DI water. Finally, we compared the performance of SiO2 with other dielectric materials such as PDMS and Ta2O5 in air/water and silicone oil/water medium.},

The XRD studies illustrated the amorphous and crystalline nature of PPy and PPy/V2O5 composites, respectively. The electrochemical ammonia sensing behavior of the synthesized materials was evaluated using LCR-meter. The sensitivity of the materials towards ammonia was studied with respect to V2O5 content in the composites, temperature and ammonia concentration. Among the studied materials, PPy/V2O5 composite with 8 wt.\% of V2O5 showed best sensitivity response toward ammonia at 25 °C in the range of 5–200 ppm with limit of detection of 1.4 ppm. The sensitivity, response and recovery times of PPy/8 wt.\%V2O5 determined from dynamic response curve at 10 ppm ammonia were 19.5\%, 10.5 and 81.6 s, respectively. The highly selective ammonia sensing performance of PPy/V2O5 composites may be due the incorporation of V2O5 in PPy and could be declared as a promising candidate for sensitive gas sensors.},

  abstract = {In this study, we designed and developed an interdigitated capacitor (IDC)-based taste sensor array to detect different taste substances. The designed taste sensing array has four IDC sensing elements. The four IDC taste sensing elements of the array are fabricated by incorporating four different types of lipids into the polymer, dioctyl phenylphosphonate (DOPP) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) to make the respective dielectric materials that are individually placed onto an interdigitated electrode (IDE) via spin coating. When the dielectric material of an IDC sensing element comes into contact with a taste substance, its dielectric properties change with the capacitance of the IDC sensing element; this, in turn, changes the voltage across the IDC, as well as the output voltage of each channel of the system. In order to assess the effectiveness of the sensing system, four taste substances, namely sourness (HCl), saltiness (NaCl), sweetness (glucose) and bitterness (quinine-HCl), were tested. The IDC taste sensor array had rapid response and recovery times of about 12.9 s and 13.39 s, respectively, with highly stable response properties. The response property of the proposed IDC taste sensor array was linear, and its correlation coefficient R2 was about 0.9958 over the dynamic range of the taste sensor array as the taste substance concentration was varied from 1 μM to 1 M. The proposed IDC taste sensor array has several other advantages, such as real-time monitoring capabilities, high sensitivity 45.78 mV/decade, good reproducibility with a standard deviation of about 0.029 and compactness, and the circuitry is based on readily available and inexpensive electronic components. The proposed IDC taste sensor array was compared with the potentiometric taste sensor with respect to sensitivity, dynamic range width, linearity and response time. We found that the proposed IDC sensor array has better performance. Finally, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to discriminate different types of taste of the mixed taste substances.},

  abstract = {The ability to manipulate a liquid meniscus using electrowetting has many applications. In any electrowetting design, at least two electrodes are required: one forms the field to change the contact angle and the other functions as a ground electrode. The contribution of the ground electrode (GE) to the dynamics of electrowetting has not yet been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we discovered that with a bare ground electrode, the contact angle of a sessile drop increases instead of decreases when a direct current (DC) voltage varying from zero to the threshold voltage is applied. This phenomenon is opposite to what occurs when the GE is coated with a dielectric, where the contact-angle change follows the Lippmann–Young equation above the threshold voltage of electrowetting. However, this behaviour is not observed with either a dielectric-coated electrode using direct current (DC) or a bare ground electrode using alternating current (AC) voltage electrowetting. This study explains this phenomenon with finite element simulation and theory. From previous research work, the ground electrode configuration is inconsistent. In some studies, the ground electrode is exposed to water; in other studies, the ground electrode is covered with dielectric. This study identified that an exposed ground electrode is not required in electrowetting. Moreover, this research work suggests that for applications where precise control of the contact angle is paramount, a dielectric-coated ground electrode should be used since it prevents the increase in the contact angle when increasing the applied potential from zero to the threshold voltage. This study also identified that contact angle hysteresis is lower with a Cytop-coated ground electrode and DC voltage than with a bare ground electrode using AC or DC voltages.},

A DMF device is a liquid-droplets-handling platform with varied applications in the fields of medical diagnostics, drug discovery, chemical analysis, environmental monitoring, and basic scientific research. These operations can be performed in a rapid, low-cost, portable, and reliable environment using DMF devices. Two of the important elements of DMF devices are electro-wetting on dielectric phenomenon and hydrophobicity. Under an applied voltage of either AC or DC, the electro-wetting effect induces a reduction in the contact angle of the droplet with the hydrophobic surface. This enables manipulation of motion and position of droplets on the hydrophobic surface. In this work, the actuation of droplets on an open DMF device with a single array of electrodes is carried out. The fabrication of DMF plate is carried out on a copper covered plate by patterning using black tapes and etching using etchants. The circuit is arranged using PCB, jumper wires, 8-channel relay, 9V battery, acpower regulator and a microcontroller (Arduino/Genuino UNO).},

However, notably, much of the research into molecular self-assembly has been performed using conventional bulk techniques where the resultant species are dictated by thermodynamic stability to yield relatively simple assemblies. Whereas, the environmental control offered by microfluidic systems offers methods to achieve non-equilibrium reaction conditions capable of increasingly sophisticated self-assembled structures. Alterations to the immediate microenvironment during the assembly of the molecules is possible, providing the basis for kinetically-controlled assembly. This review examines the key mechanism offered by microfluidic systems and the architectures required to access them.

To address this limitation, we are developing a digital microfluidic (DMF) platform to function as a fluid distribution hub, enabling the integration of multiple subsystem modules into an automated NGS library sample preparation system. A novel capillary interface enables highly repeatable transfer of liquid between the DMF device and the external fluidic modules, allowing both continuous-flow and droplet-based sample manipulations to be performed in one integrated system. Here, we highlight the utility of the DMF hub platform and capillary interface for automating two key operations in the NGS sample preparation workflow. Using an in-line contactless conductivity detector in conjunction with the capillary interface, we demonstrate closed-loop automated fraction collection of target analytes from a continuous-flow sample stream into droplets on the DMF device. Buffer exchange and sample cleanup, the most repeated steps in NGS library preparation, are also demonstrated on the DMF platform using a magnetic bead assay and achieving an average DNA recovery efficiency of 80\% ± 4.8\%.},

  abstract = {Soft artificial skin sensors that can detect contact forces as well as their locations are attractive in various soft robotics applications. However, soft sensors made of polymer materials have inherent limitations of hysteresis and nonlinearity in response, which makes it highly difficult to implement traditional calibration techniques and yields poor estimation performance. In this paper, we propose intelligent algorithms based on machine learning and logics that can improve the performance of soft sensors. The proposed methods in this paper could be solutions to the aforementioned long-standing problems. They can also be used to simplify the system complexity by reducing the number of signal wires. Three machine learning techniques are discussed in this paper: an artificial neural network (ANN), the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm, and a recurrent neural network (RNN). The Preisach model of hysteresis and simple logics were used to support these algorithms. We proved that classifying contact locations on a soft sensor is possible using simple algorithms in real time. Also, force estimation of a single contact was possible using an ANN with the Preisach method. Finally, we successfully estimated forces of multiple contact locations by predicting the outputs of mixed RNN results.},

  abstract = {Contact charge electrophoresis (CCEP) is an electrically controllable manipulation technique of conductive droplets and particles by charging and discharging when in contact with the electrode. Given its straightforward operation mechanism, low cost, and ease of system construction, it has gained traction as a versatile and potential strategy for the realistic establishment of lab-on-a-chip (LOC) in various engineering applications. We present a CCEP-based digital microfluidics (DMF) platform with two parallel electrode modules comprising assembled conventional pin header sockets, allowing for efficient mixing through horizontal and vertical shaking via droplet reciprocating motions. The temporal chromic change caused by the chemical reaction between the pH indicator and base solutions within the shaking droplets is quantitatively analyzed under various CCEP actuation conditions to evaluate the mixing performance in shaking droplets by vertical and horizontal reciprocating motions on the DMF platform. Furthermore, mixing flow patterns within shaking droplets are successfully visualized by a high-speed camera system. The suggested techniques can mix samples and reagents rapidly and efficiently in droplet-based microreactors for DMF applications, such as biochemical analysis and medical diagnostics.},

Rough silica layers were deposited on a Si substrate by the electrospraying of SiO               2               for different times (10 s–10 min) and subsequently Teflon coated with different thicknesses (35 and 625 nm). The surface roughness measurements revealed an increase in roughness with increasing electrospraying time. A thinner (35 nm) Teflon-coated layer showed better EW properties and was selected for subsequent studies. By applying different voltages (0–200 V) to the thinner Teflon-coated rough SiO               2               layers, the water contact angle (WCA) decreased continuously and the SiO               2               layer that had been electrosprayed for 20 s showed the maximum decrease in WCA in air, whereas the wetting behavior changed from hydrophobic to hydrophilic under a voltage of 200 V. In addition, the EW behavior of the SiO               2               layers in oil ambient was studied and it was found that under the maximum applied voltage (150 V), both 20 and 30 s electrosprayed layers exhibited hydrophilic behavior. These results showed that electric leaking currents, which are largely ignored, can be used to tailor the relationship between the WCA and applied voltage: from a non-linear (               V               2               ) to a linear (               V               ) function. In particular, a decrease in the WCA equals the applied voltage normalized to the maximum (or breakdown) external voltage. This study opens a new research field in materials chemistry with regards to the coupling of electrochemical, thermodynamic and mechanical interactions.},

Here, we present a novel approach for high throughput single cell arraying by integrating two original microfluidic devices: an acoustofluidic chip and an electroactive microwell array. The velocity of the cells is geared down in the acoustofluidic chip while maintaining a high volume flow rate at the inlet of the microsystem, and the cells are subsequently trapped one by one into the microwell array using dielectrophoresis. The integrated system exhibited a 10 times improved sample throughput compared to trapping with the electroactive microwell array chip alone, while maintaining a highly efficient cell recovery above 90\%. The results indicate that the serial integration of the acoustophoretic pre-concentration with the dielectrophoretic cell trapping drastically improves the performance of the electroactive microwell array for highly efficient single cell analysis. This simple and effective system for high throughput single cell arraying with further possible integration of additional functions, including cell sorting and downstream analysis after cell trapping, has potential for development to a highly integrated and automated platform for single-cell analysis of rare cells.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we proposed an integrated microfluidic device that could demonstrate the non-contact, label-free separation of particles and cells through the combination of inertial microfluidics and acoustophoresis. The proposed device integrated two microfluidic chips which were a PDMS channel chip on top of the silicon-based acoustofluidic chip. The PDMS chip worked by prefocusing the particles/cells through inducing the inertial force of the channel structure. The connected acoustofluidic chips separated particles based on their size through an acoustic radiation force. In the serpentine-shaped PDMS chip, particles formed two lines focusing in the channel, and a trifugal-shaped acoustofluidic chip displaced and separated particles, in which larger particles focused on the central channel and smaller ones moved to the side channels. The simultaneous fluidic works allowed high-efficiency particle separation. Using this novel acoustofluidic device with an inertial microchannel, the separation of particles and cells based on their size was presented and analyzed, and the efficiency of the device was shown. The device demonstrated excellent separation performance with a high recovery ratio (up to 96.3\%), separation efficiency (up to 99\%), and high volume rate ({$>$}100 µL/min). Our results showed that integrated devices could be a viable alternative to current cell separation based on their low cost, reduced sample consumption and high throughput capability.},

Mixing droplets without a top cover plate is important for bio-chemical analysis. For this reason, a more efficient mixing method is required especially for mixing a viscous liquid droplet in an open surface. Here, to improve the performance of droplet mixing, we propose the integration of an acoustically oscillating bubble to an electrowettingon-dielectric (EWOD) chip, which can generate microstreaming inside the droplet. Firstly, an EWOD chip integrated with through-holes for bubble trapping was designed and fabricated through PCB fabrication. This PCB manufacturing technology helps to place more electrodes in the limited chip size. Secondly, we developed the custom-made circuit and interface to individually control multiple actuators (including EWOD actuation and acoustic excitation). Finally, an operation test was conducted to evaluate the capability of not only droplet transportation but also mixing on an open surface. The proposed PCB-based DMF platform for bubble-induced droplet mixing was experimentally verified and expected to make DMF chips more efficient when used for clinical point-of-care diagnostic applications.},

These specialized analytical tools can determine the effectiveness and toxicity of drugs with high sensitivity and demonstrate biological functions on a single-cell scale.

Identifying the latest trends in single-cell trapping technologies afford opportunities such as new structural design and combination with other technologies. This will lead to more advanced applications towards improving measurement sensitivity to the desired target. In this review, we examined the basic principles of impedance sensors and their applications in various biological fields. In the next step, we introduced the latest trend of microfluidic chip technology for trapping single cells and summarized the important findings on the characteristics of single cells in impedance biosensor systems that successfully trapped single cells. This is expected to be used as a leading technology in cell biology, pathology, and pharmacological fields, promoting the further understanding of complex functions and mechanisms within individual cells with numerous data sampling and accurate analysis capabilities.},

In many of these applications, there is demand for increased performance along with decreased size and cost of sensor technology. Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) are an attractive option to fill this demand due to the small resolution of feature sizes (≈ 1µm) and the ease of mass-production due to compliance with standard microfabrication processes. Within MEMS, surface acoustic wave sensors (SAWS) offer a particularly interesting sensor option due to the wide variety of measurable phenomena—from temperature to biological agents to magnetic field strength—and potential applications—ranging from individual sensors with additional packaging to large-scale, distributed sensor networks. In this paper, we shall explore the design process of a surface acoustic wave sensor both to gain understanding of the range of the design space of surface acoustic wave devices and how to design a SAWS with selected properties for use in a chosen application.},

  abstract = {The opportunity for the commercialization of microfluidic systems has surged over the recent decade, primarily for medical and the life science applications. This positive development has been spurred by an increasing number of integrated, highly functional lab-on-a-chip technologies from the research community. Toward commercialization, there is a dire need for economic manufacture which involves optimized cost for materials and structuring on the front-end as well as for a range of back-end processing steps such as surface modification, integration of functional elements, assembly and packaging. Front-end processing can readily resort to very well established polymer mass fabrication schemes, e.g. injection molding. Also assembly and packaging can often be adopted from commercially available processes. In this review, we survey the back-end processes of hybrid material integration and surface modification which often need to be tailored to the specifics of miniaturized polymeric microfluidic systems. On the one hand, the accurate control of these back-end processes proves to be the key to the technical function of the system and thus the value creation. On the other hand, the integration of functional materials constitutes a major cost factor.},

To achieve maximum efficiency, parallel control of microlitre droplets using automated techniques is essential. Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD), which manipulates droplets using the imbalance of wetting on a substrate, is the most widely employed method. However, EWOD is limited in its capability to make droplets detach from the substrate (jumping), which hinders throughput and device integration. Here, we propose a novel microfluidic system based on focused ultrasound passing through a hydrophobic mesh with droplets resting on top. A phased array dynamically creates foci to manipulate droplets of up to 300 μL. This platform offers a jump height of up to 10 cm, a 27-fold improvement over conventional EWOD systems. In addition, droplets can be merged or split by pushing them against a hydrophobic knife. We demonstrate Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling using our platform, showing its potential for a wide range of chemical experiments. Biofouling in our system was lower than in conventional EWOD, demonstrating its high suitability for biological experiments. Focused ultrasound allows the manipulation of both solid and liquid targets. Our platform provides a foundation for the advancement of micro-robotics, additive manufacturing, and laboratory automation.},

Several distinctive methods used to expand the surface area of 3D IDEAs, such as a unique 3D IDEA design, integration of mesh, microchannel, vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNT), and nanoparticles, are demonstrated and discussed. More notably, the conventional four-electrode system, consisting of reference and counter electrodes will be compared to the highly novel two-electrode system that adopts IDEA’s shape. Compared to the 2D planar IDEA, the expansion of the surface area in 3D IDEAs demonstrated significant changes in the performance of electrochemical sensors.

  abstract = {An electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) sensor design is proposed based on a standard interdigitated electrode layout in which the smaller working electrode consists of gold (Au) whereas the larger combined counter and reference electrode is coated with a porous layer of polypyrrole (PPy) doped with polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) (PPy:PSS). Each electrode material was first characterized by EIS in a standard 3-electrode setup with subsequent spectra fitting by a modified Randles equivalent circuit. The differences in the spectra obtained by the PPy:PSS coated electrodes can be explained by an increased electroactive surface area due to the porous polymer film. The changes in morphology of the film are discussed with respect to the evolution of the elements of the electric equivalent circuit. When applying the Au/PPy:PSS electrode combination to a standard 2-electrode arrangement, the enlarged highly electroactive surface area of the PPy:PSS coating lowers the interfacial impedance in a way that mainly the gold working electrode contributes to the overall system impedance. Therefore, obtaining reproducible EIS signals depends only on the electrode’s open-circuit potential (OCP) and on additional adsorption events at the gold electrode/electrolyte interface. We present a protocol for microelectrode coating with PPy:PSS, which enables highly stable 2-electrode EIS experiments without the need of a reference electrode. This combination is believed to be very useful if an integration of sensing electrodes inside Micro Total Analysis Systems is aspired.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a protocol using theoretical methods and free software to design and analyze multivolume digital PCR (MV digital PCR) devices; the theory and software are also applicable to design and analysis of dilution series in digital PCR. MV digital PCR minimizes the total number of wells required for “digital” (single molecule) measurements while maintaining high dynamic range and high resolution. In some examples, multivolume designs with fewer than 200 total wells are predicted to provide dynamic range with 5-fold resolution similar to that of single-volume designs requiring 12 000 wells. Mathematical techniques were utilized and expanded to maximize the information obtained from each experiment and to quantify performance of devices and were experimentally validated using the SlipChip platform. MV digital PCR was demonstrated to perform reliably, and results from wells of different volumes agreed with one another. No artifacts due to different surface-to-volume ratios were observed, and single molecule amplification in volumes ranging from 1 to 125 nL was self-consistent. The device presented here was designed to meet the testing requirements for measuring clinically relevant levels of HIV viral load at the point-of-care (in plasma, {$<$}500 molecules/mL to {$>$}1 000 000 molecules/ mL), and the predicted resolution and dynamic range was experimentally validated using a control sequence of DNA. This approach simplifies digital PCR experiments, saves space, and thus enables multiplexing using separate areas for each sample on one chip, and facilitates the development of new high-performance diagnostic tools for resource-limited applications. The theory and software presented here are general and are applicable to designing and analyzing other digital analytical platforms including digital immunoassays and digital bacterial analysis. It is not limited to SlipChip and could also be useful for the design of systems on platforms including valve-based and droplet-based platforms. In a separate publication by Shen et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2011, DOI: 10.1021/ja2060116), this approach is used to design and test digital RT-PCR devices for quantifying RNA.},

  abstract = {A conventional photolithography technique was used to fabricate three types of Archimedean-spiral interdigitated electrodes (AIDEs) containing concentric interlocking electrodes with different electrode and gap sizes, i.e., 150 μm (D1), 100 μm (D2), and 50 μm (D3). The precision of the fabrication was validated by surface topography using scanning electron microscopy, high power microscopy, 3D-nano profilometry, and atomic force microscopy. These AIDEs were fabricated with a tolerance of ± 6 nm in dimensions. The insignificant current variation at the pico-ampere range for all bare AIDEs further proved the reproducibility of the device. The large gap sized AIDE (D1) is insensitive to acidic medium, whereas D2 and D3 are insensitive to alkali medium. D2 was the best with regard to its electrical characterization. Furthermore, uniformly synthesized molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) nanoparticles prepared with human blood clotting factor IX and its aptamer were in the size range 140 to 160 nm, attached on the sensing surface and characterized. The average thickness of deposited MIP film was 1.7 μm. EDX data shows the prominent peaks for silicon and aluminum substrates as 61.79 and 22.52\%, respectively. The MIP nanoparticles-deposited sensor surface was characterized by applying it in electrolyte solutions, and smooth curves with the current flow were observed at pH lower than 8 and discriminated against alkali media. This study provides a new MIP amalgamated AIDE with nano-gapped fingers enabling analysis of other biomaterials due to its operation in an ideal buffer range.},

Mainly due to human activity, the strain on the water resources of our planet has increased substantially, requiring action in water management and purification. Water quality sensors are needed in order to quantify the problem and verify the success of remedial actions. This review summarizes the most common chemical water quality parameters, and current developments in sensor technology available to monitor them. Particular emphasis is on technologies that lend themselves to reagent-free, low-maintenance, autonomous and continuous monitoring. Chemiresistors and other electrical sensors are discussed in particular detail, while mechanical, optical and electrochemical sensors also find mentioning. The focus here is on the physics of chemical signal transduction in sensor elements that are in direct contact with the analyte. All other sensing methods, and all other elements of sampling, sample pre-treatment as well as the collection, transmission and analysis of the data are not discussed here. Instead, the goal is to highlight the progress and remaining challenges in the development of sensor materials and designs for an audience of physicists and materials scientists.},

Herein, the application of microfluidic devices for nucleic acid amplification has recently been extensively and vigorously studied and implemented. However, the existing classical instruments are hefty, excessive thermal loss, more power consumption, laborious, and require more execution time. Further, it is hard to establish a platform to integrate, automate, and miniaturize the microdevice on a solo stage for testing and analyzing. There has been substantial innovation in the development of continuous-flow based microfluidic PCR micro-devices in the last few decades because of their widespread applications. The continuous-flow microfluidic PCR microdevice enables several features like compact device, portability, repeatability, miniaturization, and integration with a marginal sample reaction volume. It also permits rapid testing and identification of the genetic sample with high-throughput and increased efficiency and output stability of the microdevice by using minimum accessories for its operation.

  abstract = {In recent times, there has been rapid progress and achievement in the development of nanoparticle production in a microfluidic environment. Microfluidics technology harnesses the fluid mechanics to generate nanoparticles with a unique size and finely controllable shape that can be used for various applications like drug delivery, biological sciences, healthcare, and food industries. The nanoparticles are generally distinguished from fine particles to coarse particles due to their smaller size and unique material properties like chemical, physical, biological, and optical. However, the conventional methods require bulky instruments, expensive autoclaves, consume more power, high thermal loss, and require more time for the synthesis. Further, it is very challenging to automate, integrate, and miniaturize the conventional device on a single platform for synthesizing micro-and nanoscale particles. There has been considerable advancement in the development of microfluidic devices in the last few years for nanoparticle synthesis. The microfluidic device unveils several features such as portability, transparency in operation, controllability, and stability with a marginal reaction volume. The microfluidic-based nanoparticle synthesis also allows rapid processing and increased efficiency of the technique by using minimum peripherals for its operation.

  abstract = {Using pathogen-infected food that can be unhygienic can result in severe diseases and an increase in mortality rate among humans. This may arise as a serious emergency problem if not appropriately restricted at this point of time. Thus, food science researchers are concerned with precaution, prevention, perception, and immunity to pathogenic bacteria. Expensive, elongated assessment time and the need for skilled personnel are some of the shortcomings of the existing conventional methods. Developing and investigating a rapid, low-cost, handy, miniature, and effective detection technology for pathogens is indispensable. In recent times, there has been a significant scope of interest for microfluidics-based three-electrode potentiostat sensing platforms, which have been extensively used for sustainable food safety exploration because of their progressively high selectivity and sensitivity. Meticulously, scholars have made noteworthy revolutions in signal enrichment tactics, measurable devices, and portable tools, which can be used as an allusion to food safety investigation. Additionally, a device for this purpose must incorporate simplistic working conditions, automation, and miniaturization. In order to meet the critical needs of food safety for on-site detection of pathogens, point-of-care testing (POCT) has to be introduced and integrated with microfluidic technology and electrochemical biosensors. This review critically discusses the recent literature, classification, difficulties, applications, and future directions of microfluidics-based electrochemical sensors for screening and detecting foodborne pathogens.},

  abstract = {In recent times, microheaters have gained a vast range of attention due to their universal existence in most research domains such as healthcare, pharmaceutical, clinical, electrical, and mechanical applications. Especially, post-COVID-19 the significance of microheaters in the point-of-care-testing based microdevices has immensely increased and overlaid the way for the possibility of the development of microfluidic-based diagnostics tools for point-of-care applications. In microfluidics, temperature is a crucial aspect but occasionally disregarded parameter due to its non-uniform distribution and unstable heat regulation within the microchannels. Nevertheless, fluctuations in size, ramping rate, stability, and accuracy make them unsuitable for operating in isolated areas. Microarchitecture of heaters decreases power utilization, increases ramping rate, maintains uniform temperature distribution, executes rapid response, and improves temperature conductivity. The usual thickness of a microheater comes around 100 nm to 100 μm and provides precision control over a temperature range of up to {$>$}1000 ◦C. Because of the escalating demand for wearable biosensors, wearable electronics, and flexible materials, microheaters have transpired as an exigent and peremptory in most research areas. This review comprehensively discusses several different kinds of microheaters emphasizing design, material selection, optimization, and fabrication tools, that are predominantly used in microfluidic technology for POCT applications. Further, this also throws limelight on emerging technological trends and challenges in microelectro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) based microheaters that can pave the way for developing advanced, rapid, reliable, and susceptible devices that are implemented in healthcare diagnostics, electrical, biomedical, and mechanical domains within microscale environment.},

  abstract = {A droplet impacting hydrophobic/superhydrophobic surfaces undergoes spreading, recoiling, and rebounding. All these phenomena are affected by the energy exchange between the impacting droplet and the surface. In the present work, an electrowetting technique is implemented to change the droplet interaction with the surface. The droplet impact on hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surfaces combined with alternating current electrowetting on dielectric (AC EWOD) has been numerically investigated. Droplet impact characteristics have been studied for various voltage amplitudes, frequencies, and surface hydrophobicities. These factors strongly affect the droplet dynamics of the impacting droplet. An increase in voltage amplitude enhances the maximum spreading of the impacting droplet. In contrast, it reduces the recoiling rate of the droplet, resulting in partial or complete suppression of the droplet rebound. At a particular voltage amplitude, frequency and hydrophobicity of the surface affect the droplet rebound suppression. Complete rebound suppression has been observed at higher voltage amplitudes and the medium range of frequencies (25–50 Hz). The contact time of the droplet decreases with the increase in surface hydrophobicity at all frequencies, whereas it increases with the voltage amplitude. Contact line velocity and velocity inside the droplet manifest the inertia of the droplet. The droplet is unable to rebound if velocities are very low.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic biochips are recently being developed for on-chip implementation of biochemical laboratory assays. Existing mixing algorithms determine the mixing tree or mixing graph from a given target ratio of several biochemical fluids for on-chip mixture preparation. We present an algorithm to determine a reduced mixing tree by sharing the common subtrees within itself. We observe two transformations that preserve the semantics of the tree: (a) permutation of leaf nodes (input fluids/reagents) within the same level of a mixing tree, and (b) level-shifting of a leaf node to the next lower level by duplicating its appearance. The proposed algorithm utilizes both the intermediate droplets obtained after a split operation when a pair of identical subtrees are identified under permutation of leaf nodes at the same level. Simulation results for a large set of target ratios show that our algorithm reduces the mean values of the total number of mix-split steps, waste droplets and the number of mixer modules required for earliest completion by 16\%, 29\% and 12\% over Min-Mix and by 22\%, 34\% and 20\% over RMA, respectively. Moreover, it reduces the number of checkpoint insertions required for dynamic error recovery against incorrect mix-split steps during mixture preparation.},

  abstract = {Waterborne diseases that originated due to pathogen microorganisms are emerging as a serious global health concern. Therefore, rapid, accurate, and specific detection of these microorganisms (i.e., bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and parasitic pathogens) in water resources has become a requirement of water quality assessment. Significant research has been conducted to develop rapid, efficient, scalable, and affordable sensing techniques to detect biological contaminants. State-of-the-art technology-assisted smart sensors have improved features (high sensitivity and very low detection limit) and can perform in a real-time manner. However, there is still a need to promote this area of research, keeping global aspects and demand in mind. Keeping this view, this article was designed carefully and critically to explore sensing technologies developed for the detection of biological contaminants. Advancements using paper-based assays, microfluidic platforms, and lateral flow devices are discussed in this report. The emerging recent trends, mainly point-of-care (POC) technologies, of water safety analysis are also discussed here, along with challenges and future prospective applications of these smart sensing technologies for water health diagnostics.},

  abstract = {Fisheries, one of the growing sectors in Malaysia, contribute a notable percentage to the national gross domestic product. The fisheries sector rapidly and dynamically grew throughout the past three decades. Aquaculture commodities are currently providing remarkable contributions to the fisheries sector, overcoming the previous dominance of traditional marine capture commodities. The fisheries sector is facing environmental issues, especially considering water-related pollution, despite its contribution to the economic sector. Aquaculture effluents contain high organic materials, nutrients, proteins, and even contaminants of emerging concern. Several studies have already been conducted to treat the generated wastewater. However, investigations on environmentally friendly technology, which might lead to resource recovery from aquaculture effluent, are still limited and scarce. This review paper comprises the development of aquaculture in Malaysia, its potential of generating abundant amounts of wastewater, and its characteristics. This paper summarizes the best practice of aquaculture effluent treatment and also highlights the green technology, which can be utilized to overcome the issue of currently utilized physico-chemical treatment. In addition, this paper emphasizes the considerable potential of valuable material recovery from the aquaculture effluent using a combination of bio-coagulant/bio-flocculant utilization and constructed wetland to achieve cleaner production for the aquaculture sector.},

In this review, we provide the details of primary microfluidic techniques that have received much attention for bioassays. First, we introduce the manipulation techniques using a sole driving source, i.e., dielectrophoresis, electrophoresis, optical tweezers, magnetophoresis, and acoustophoresis. Next, we present rapid electrokinetic patterning, a hybrid opto-electric manipulation technique developed recently. It is introduced in detail along with the underlying physical principle, operating environment, and current challenges.

  abstract = {Heavy metal pollution of water has become a global issue and is especially problematic in some developing countries. Heavy metals are toxic to living organisms, even at very low concentrations. Therefore, effective and reliable heavy metal detection in environmental water is very important. Current laboratory-based methods used for analysis of heavy metals in water require sophisticated instrumentation and highly trained technicians, making them unsuitable for routine heavy metal monitoring in the environment. Consequently, there is a growing demand for autonomous detection systems that could perform in situ or point-of-use measurements. Microfluidic detection systems, which are defined by their small size, have many characteristics that make them suitable for environmental analysis. Some of these advantages include portability, high sample throughput, reduced reagent consumption and waste generation, and reduced production cost. This review focusses on developments in the application of microfluidic detection systems to heavy metal detection in water. Microfluidic detection strategies based on optical techniques, electrochemical techniques, and quartz crystal microbalance are discussed.},

We introduce a new format for microfluidic SPE relying on C18-functionalized magnetic beads that can be manipulated in droplets in a digital microfluidic platform. This format provides the opportunity to tune the amount (and potentially the type) of stationary phase on-the-fly, and allows the removal of beads after the extraction (to enable other operations in same device-space), maintaining device reconfigurability. Using the new method, we employed a design of experiments (DOE) operation to enable automated on-chip optimization of elution solvent composition for reversed phase SPE of a model system. Further, conditions were selected to enable on-chip fractionation of multiple analytes. Finally, the method was demonstrated to be useful for online cleanup of extracts from dried blood spot (DBS) samples. We anticipate this combination of features will prove useful for separating a wide range of analytes, from small molecules to peptides, from complex matrices.},

Confinement of single cells to small, picoliter-sized droplets within a continuous phase of oil provides chemical isolation of each cell, creating individual microreactors where rare cell qualities are highlighted and otherwise undetectable signals can be concentrated to measurable levels. Recent work in microfluidics has yielded methods for the encapsulation of cells in aqueous droplets and hydrogels at kilohertz rates, creating the potential for millions of parallel single-cell experiments. However, commercial applications of high-throughput microdroplet generation and downstream sensing and actuation methods are still emerging for cells.

  abstract = {Managing waterborne ammonia–nitrogen pollution requires monitoring distributed wastewater nitrogen discharges. In this study, we demonstrated and investigated a proof-ofconcept sensor that combines selective electrochemical separation and sensitive capacitive detection for sensing total ammonia nitrogen (TAN). By varying TAN concentration in synthetic ammonia-polluted water (up to 50 mg/L), we selectively separated ammonia nitrogen from feedwater into a sulfuric acid solution, in which capacitance decreased linearly with increasing TAN (R2 {$>$} 0.99). Experimental observations were supported by theoretical explanations for the decrease in capacitance as ammonia absorbs into the sulfuric acid solution and abstracts protons. Capacitive detection facilitated TAN sensing at higher acid concentrations (up to 0.5 M H2SO4) than conductivity detection (up to 0.01 M H2SO4), which enables sensitive sensors with larger TAN detection ranges, longer deployment, and less complexity. Results from this study provide evidence of the use of selective separations and their transport mechanisms for environmental sensing applications.},

The latter are termed “surface transverse waves” (STW), and they have comparatively low attenuation values when operated in liquids. Later Love wave devices were developed, which used a film resonance effect to significantly reduce attenuation. All of these sensor approaches were accompanied by the development of appropriate sensing films. First attempts used simple layers of adsorbed antibodies. Later approaches used various types of covalently bound layers, for example those utilizing intermediate hydrogel layers. Recent approaches involve SAW biosensor devices inserted into compact systems with integrated fluidics for sample handling. To achieve this, the SAW biosensors can be embedded into micromachined polymer housings. Combining these two features will extend the system to create versatile biosensor arrays for generic lab use or for diagnostic purposes.},

Significant advances on iDEP have been reported during the last 15 years. This review article aims to summarize some of the most important findings on iDEP organized by the type of dielectrophoretic mode: streaming and trapping iDEP. The former is primarily used for particle sorting, while the latter has great capability for particle enrichment. The characteristics of a wide array of devices are discussed for each type of dielectrophoretic mode in order to present an overview of the distinct designs and applications developed with iDEP. A short section on Joule heating effects and electrothermal flow is also included to highlight some of the challenges in the utilization of iDEP systems. The significant progress on iDEP illustrates its potential for a large number of applications, ranging from bioanalysis to clinical and biomedical assessments. The present article discusses the work on iDEP by numerous research groups around the world, with the aim of proving the reader with an overview of the state‐of‐the‐art in iDEP microfluidic systems.},

  abstract = {Droplet-based microfluidics is capable of being a superior platform for biological and biomedical applications due to their higher accuracy, throughput and sensitivity, low reagent consumption and fast reaction time. However, the complex and nonlinear behavior of multiphase microfluidic devices and several parameters affecting droplet size simultaneously necessitates costly design iterations to generate droplets with the radius of interest for a certain application. To address this, we exploit soft computing methods to bridge fuzzy systems and neural networks in order to build an adaptive neural-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) that predicts the droplet size generated in a flow-focusing microfluidic device based on six major parameters, that includes geometry, flow, and fluid properties. This model shows a significant accuracy with a coefficient of determination of 0.96 when compared to the observed data points. Once the ANFIS model is built and verified, we use it to study the effect of each input parameter on droplet size which is challenging and/or expensive to determine experimentally.},

For applications in life sciences not only the processing but also the characterization of fluids is crucial. In this contribution, a microfluidic platform, combining the actuation principle of electrowetting on dielectrics for droplet manipulations and the sensor principle of impedance spectroscopy for the characterization of the fluid composition and condition, is presented. The fabrication process of the microfluidic platform comprises physical vapor deposition and structuring of the metal electrodes onto a substrate, the deposition of a dielectric isolator and a hydrophobic top coating. The key advantage of this microfluidic chip is the common electric nature of the sensor and the actuation principle. This allows for fabricating digital microfluidic devices with a minimal number of process steps. Multiple measurements on fluids of different composition (including rigid particles) and of different conditions (temperature, sedimentation) were performed and process parameters were monitored online. These sample applications demonstrate the versatile applications of this combined technology.},

In this study, electrowetting actuations with square pulse signals are employed to detach droplets from a hydrophobic surface. The threshold voltage for droplet detachment is obtained both experimentally and theoretically to find that it is almost constant for various droplet volumes ranging from 0.4 to 10 μL. It is also found that droplets can be detached more easily when the width of applied pulse is well-matched to the spreading time (i.e., the time to reach the maximum spread diameter). When the droplet is actuated by a double square pulse, the threshold voltage is reduced by ∼20\% from that for a single square pulse actuation. Finally, by introducing an interdigitated electrode system, it is demonstrated that droplets can be detached from the solid bottom surface without using a top needle electrode.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidics has become intensively explored as an effective method for liquid handling in lab-on-a-chip (LOC) systems. Liquid dielectrophoresis (L-DEP) has many advantages and exciting prospects in driving droplets. To fully realize the potential benefits of this technique, one must know the droplet volume accurately for its distribution and manipulation. Here we present an investigation of the tensile length of a droplet subjected to a L-DEP force with varied parameters to achieve precise control of the volume of a droplet. Liquid propylene carbonate served as a driving liquid in the L-DEP experiment. The chip was divided into two parts: an electrode of width fixed at 0.1 mm and a total width fixed at 1 mm. Each had a variation of six electrode spacings. The experimental results showed that the stretching length decreased with decreasing electrode width, but the stretching length did not vary with an increased spacing of the electrode. When the two electrodes were activated, the length decreased because of an increase in electrode spacing. The theory was based on the force balance on a droplet that involved the force generated by the electric field, friction force, and capillary force. The theory was improved according to the experimental results. To verify the theoretical improvement through the results, we designed a three-electrode chip for experiments. The results proved that the theory is consistent with the results of the experiments, so that the length of a droplet stretched with L-DEP and its volume can be calculated.},

BAW acoustophoresis has formerly focused on cell and particle handling, whereas here we determine the various abilities of this method for the field of droplet microfluidics. In silicon microdevices, water-in-oil droplets of 200 μm size were generated for a set of unit operations including droplet fusion, focusing, sorting and medium exchange around 0.5–1 MHz acoustic frequency.

  abstract = {The combination of digital microfluidics and magnetic beads for removal of polymer surfactants enables sensitive LC-MS-based microproteomics analyses down to 100 mammalian cells.           ,              While LC-MS-based proteomics with high nanograms to micrograms of total protein has become routine, the analysis of samples derived from low cell numbers is challenged by factors such as sample losses, or difficulties encountered with the manual manipulation of small liquid volumes. Digital microfluidics (DMF) is an emerging technique for miniaturized and automated droplet manipulation, which has been proposed as a promising tool for proteomic sample preparation. However, proteome analysis of samples prepared on-chip by DMF has previously been unfeasible, due to incompatibility with down-stream LC-MS instrumentation. To overcome these limitations, we here developed protocols for bottom-up LC-MS based proteomics sample preparation of as little as 100 mammalian cells on a commercially available digital microfluidics device. To this end, we developed effective cell lysis conditions optimized for DMF, as well as detergent–buffer systems compatible with downstream proteolytic digestion on DMF chips and subsequent LC-MS analysis. A major step was the introduction of the single-pot, solid-phase-enhanced sample preparation (SP3) approach on-chip, which allowed the removal of salts and anti-fouling polymeric detergents, thus rendering sample preparation by DMF compatible with LC-MS-based proteome analysis. Application of DMF-SP3 to the proteome analysis of Jurkat T cells led to the identification of up to 2500 proteins from approximately 500 cells, and up to 1200 proteins from approximately 100 cells on an Orbitrap mass spectrometer, emphasizing the high compatibility of DMF-SP3 with low protein input and minute volumes handled by DMF. Taken together, we demonstrate the first sample preparation workflow for proteomics on a DMF chip device reported so far, allowing the sensitive analysis of limited biological material.},

All the disciplines of gDEP are originated from the interaction of an applied electric field with its polarisation effect on the particle and can be studied systematically in a unified approach under electrostatics. In this review, the authors discuss both the quasi-static and transient theory of gDEP in an unbounded medium for both spherical and ellipsoidal particles. Then the quasi-static theory of wall effect is discussed on gDEP for a spherical particle. The wall effect is minor for ER, twDEP and cDEP parallel to wall(s), but could be significant for cDEP normal to wall(s). Force and torque expressions in terms of electric potential and its derivatives are provided and suggested for a robust calculation of the twDEP force and DEP torque. Discussions are provided for the application of the theory to nano-sized particles. The authors also illustrate some features of the Clausius –Mossotti factor using erythrocyte as an example, including both the crossover (DEP) and peak frequencies (ER) at low and high-frequency limits.},

This shrinkage has demanded that the primary integration platform, the printed circuit board (PCB), follow this same trend. Today, PCB companies offer \textasciitilde 100 micron sized features (depth and width) which mean they are becoming suitable as physical platforms for Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC) and microfluidic applications. Compared to current lithographic based fluidic approaches; PCB technology offers several advantages that are useful for this technology. These include: Being easily designed and changed using free software, robust structures that can often be reused, chip layouts that can be ordered from commercial PCB suppliers at very low cost (1 AUD each in this work), and integration of electrodes at no additional cost. Here we present the application of PCB technology in connection with microfluidics for several biomedical applications. In case of commercialization the costs for each device can be even further decreased to approximately one tenth of its current cost.},

The JLMs offer precise control on the manipulability and enhanced performance over pristine LMs. Though the properties, applications, and progress of LMs are detailed in the recent literature, a focused review encompassing the fabrication, recent developments, potential applications of JLMs, and the challenges regarding its reliable fabrication remains a gap in the literature.

With driving voltages less than 15 V it is believed to be the lowest reported driving voltage for any material system compatible with post-processing on completed integrated circuits wafers. The process architecture uses anodically grown tantalum pentoxide as a pinhole free high dielectric constant insulator with an overlying 16 nm layer of Teflon-AFÒ, which provides the hydrophobic surface for droplets manipulation. This stack provides a very robust dielectric, which maintains a sufficiently high capacitance per unit area for effective operation at a reduced voltage (15 V) which is more compatible with standard CMOS technology. The paper demonstrates that the sputtered tantalum layer used for the electrodes and the formation of the insulating dielectric can readily be integrated with both aluminium and copper interconnect used in foundry CMOS.

Consequently, as a step forward in the bottom-up creation of artificial cells, building analogous intracellular architectures is essential for the expansion of cell-mimicking functionality. Herein, we report the development of a droplet laboratory platform to engineer complex emulsion-based, multicompartment artificial cells, using microfluidics and acoustic levitation. Such levitated models provide free-standing, dynamic, definable droplet networks for the compartmentalisation of chemical species. Equally, they can be remotely operated with pneumatic, heating, and magnetic elements for post-processing, including the incorporation of membrane proteins; alpha-hemolysin; and mechanosensitive channel of large-conductance. The assembly of droplet networks is three-dimensionally patterned with fluidic input configurations determining droplet contents and connectivity, whilst acoustic manipulation can be harnessed to reconfigure the droplet network in situ. The mechanosensitive channel can be repeatedly activated and deactivated in the levitated artificial cell by the application of acoustic and magnetic fields to modulate membrane tension on demand. This offers possibilities beyond one-time chemically mediated activation to provide repeated, non-contact, control of membrane protein function. Collectively, this expands our growing capability to program and operate increasingly sophisticated artificial cells as life-like materials.},

The EWOD technology made the once-obscure electrowetting phenomenon practical, leading to the host of commercial products today.           ,                             The emergence of electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) in the early 2000s made the once-obscure electrowetting phenomenon practical and led to numerous activities over the last two decades. As an eloquent microscale liquid handling technology that gave birth to digital microfluidics, EWOD has served as the basis for many commercial products over two major application areas: optical, such as liquid lenses and reflective displays, and biomedical, such as DNA library preparation and molecular diagnostics. A number of research or start-up companies (               e.g.               , Phillips Research, Varioptic, Liquavista, and Advanced Liquid Logic) led the early commercialization efforts and eventually attracted major companies from various industry sectors (               e.g.               , Corning, Amazon, and Illumina). Although not all of the pioneering products became an instant success, the persistent growth of liquid lenses and the recent FDA approvals of biomedical analyzers proved that EWOD is a powerful tool that deserves a wider recognition and more aggressive exploration. This review presents the history around major EWOD products that hit the market to show their winding paths to commercialization and summarizes the current state of product development to peek into the future. In providing the readers with a big picture of commercializing EWOD and digital microfluidics technology, our goal is to inspire further research exploration and new entrepreneurial adventures.},

Here, a method is proposed for decreasing the saturated contact angle by controlling the behavior of charge trapping at the liquid–solid interface. An unexpected phenomenon is uncovered: for a short time the contact angle reaches smaller values before it retreats to its saturation value, which is caused by charge trapping at the liquid–solid interface. Experimental results suggest that the trapped charges can be repeatedly detrapped and retrapped when the polarity of the applied voltage is periodically reversed, which results in contact angles retreating periodically. By applying a well‐modulated voltage signal with reversing polarity, the retreat movement of the contact angle can be controlled to obtain a value significantly smaller than the previously possible threshold. As a specific application of this method, an economic two‐step process which is developed potentially suitable for mass‐producing large‐area flexible microlens arrays with controllable curvatures and wide fields of view.},

However, the current droplet generation with a single particle and cell encapsulation is a random process and suffers from a low yield that is unable to fulfill the highthroughput analysis requirement. In this work, we present a new fluorescence-activated droplet sorting (FADS) system that can isolate single-cell droplets at high accuracy and high yield using a highly focused surface acoustic wave (HFSAW) with a beam width around 50 μm. The acoustic wave is locally coupled into the microfluidic channel for droplet sorting through a micropillar waveguide structure between the channel and the interdigitated transducer (IDT). This detachable acoustic sorting system allows the disposal of the microfluidic channel after a single use to avoid cross-contamination and keeps the expensive IDT device reusable. We have achieved rapid and accurate isolation of single-cell droplets with purity higher than 90\% at ∼1 kHz sorting rate with three different encapsulation contents. In addition, with the uniformly produced droplet size at ∼40 μm, the present acoustic FADS system enables effective sorting of small particles down to submicrometer size, which is challenging for existing fluorescence-activated cell sorting systems.},

  abstract = {Human bodily kinesthetic sensing is generally complicated and ever-changing due to the diversity of body deformation as well as the complexity of mechanical stimulus, which is different from the unidirectional mechanical motion. So, there exists a huge challenge for current flexible sensors to accurately differentiate and identify what kind of external mechanical stimulus is exerted via analyzing digital signals. Here, we report a flexible dual-interdigital-electrode sensor (FDES) that consists of two interdigital electrodes and a highly pressuresensitive porous conductive sponge. The FDES can precisely identify multiple mechanical stimuli, e.g., pressing, positive bending, negative bending, X-direction stretching, and Y-direction stretching, and convert them into corresponding current variation signals. Moreover, the FDES exhibits other exceptional properties, such as high sensitivity, stretchability, large measurement range, and outstanding stability, accompanied by simple structural design and low-cost processing simultaneously. Additionally, our FDES successfully identifies various complex activities of the human body, which lays a foundation for the further development of multimode flexible sensors.},

Specifically, for surface haptic devices, the dependence of the friction force and the electroadhesion effect on the environmental relative humidity and the finger hydration level can directly impact their design and performance. This paper presents the influence of relative humidity on the finger-surface friction force and the electroadhesion performance. Mechanisms including changes to Young’s modulus of skin, contact angle change and capillary force were analyzed separately with experimental and numerical methods. Through comparison of the calculated capillary force in this paper and the electroadhesion force calculated in published papers, it was found that electrowetting at high voltage could contribute up to 60\% of the total friction force increase in electroadhesion. Therefore, in future design of surface haptic devices, the effect of electrowetting should be considered carefully.},

Droplet-interfaced electrophoresis is an emerging technique in which micro/nanometric droplets are used as a bridge and carrier of target analytes between sample treatment and electrokinetic separation steps, thus being expected to overcome the challenges of working dimension mismatch and low degree of module integration. This review covers all works on this topic from 2006 (the year of the first communication) up to 2020, with focus being given to three principal interfacing strategies, including droplets in immiscible phases, digital microfluidics with electrowetting-on-dielectric principle and inkjet droplet generation. Different instrumental developments for such purpose, the viewpoints on pros and cons of these designs as well as application demonstrations of droplet-interfaced electrokinetic strategies are discussed.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting is an elegant method to realize the motion, dispensing, splitting, and mixing of single droplets in a microfluidic system without the need for any mechanical—and fault-prone—components. By only applying an electric voltage, the interfacial energy of the fluid–solid interface is altered and the contact line of the droplet is changed. However, since the droplet shape is usually heavily distorted, it is difficult to estimate the droplet shape during the process. Further, it is often necessary to know if a process, e.g., droplet splitting on a given geometry, is possible at all, and what can be done to increase the system’s reliability. It is thus important to use computer simulations to gain an understanding about the behavior of a droplet for a given electrode geometry and voltage curve. Special care must be exercised when considering surface-tension effects. We present computer simulations done with the Surface Evolver program and a template library combined with a graphical user interface (GUI) that facilitates standard tasks in the simulation of electrowetting arrays.},

Limited to cost, complexity and flexibility, existing control techniques lack strength in meeting the need of controlling increasing number of electrodes. Here, inspired by the active matrix electrowetting-on-dielectric (AM-EWOD), we present a “direct-address based on cross-control” (DACC) method, which can easily realize N + M pins controlling N × M electrodes and guarantee the control flexibility meanwhile. Moreover, combining with impedance detection technique, we set up a cheap and portable cyberphysical system. The system’s software, written in JAVA, has a user-friendly interface and can sense all sites of the DMF in real-time and auto-design routes for droplets to bypass barriers. This novel integrated digital microfluidic system shows great potential for developing low-cost, portable, and automated EWOD DMFs in large-scale.},

Further analysis or manipulation of specific cell types or subtypes requires accurate isolation of them from the original heterogeneous samples. However, there is currently a lack of cell sorting ability that could actively separate a large number of individual cells at the single-cell level based on their multivariate biophysical makers or phenotypes. In this work, we, for the first time, demonstrate label-free and highthroughput acoustic single-cell sorting activated by the characterization of multivariate biophysical phenotypes. Electrical phenotyping is implemented by single-cell electrical impedance characterization with two pairs of differential sensing electrodes, while mechanical phenotyping is performed by extracting the transit time for the single cell to pass through microconstriction from the recorded impedance signals. A real-time impedance signal processing and triggering algorithm has been developed to identify the target sample population and activate a pulsed highly focused surface acoustic wave for single-cell level sorting. We have demonstrated acoustic single-particle sorting solely based on electrical or mechanical phenotyping. Furthermore, we have applied the developed microfluidic system to sort live MCF-7 cells from a mixture of fixed and live MCF-7 population activated by a combined electrical and mechanical phenotyping at a high throughput {$>$}100 cells/s and purity ∼91.8\%. This demonstrated ability to analyze and sort cells based on multivariate biophysical phenotyping provides a solution to the current challenges of cell purification that lack specific molecular biomarkers.},

  abstract = {Multilayer interconnections are needed for microdevices with a large number of independent electrodes. A multi-level photolithographic process is commonly employed to provide multilayer interconnections in integrated circuit devices, but it is often too expensive for large-area or disposable devices frequently needed for microfluidics. The printed circuit board (PCB) can provide multilayer interconnection at low cost, but its rough topography poses a challenge for small droplets to slide over. Here we report a low-cost fabrication of low-topography multilayer interconnects by selective and controlled anodization of thin-film metal layers. The process utilizes anodization of metal (tantalum in this paper) or, more specifically, repetitions of a partial anodization to form insulation layers between conductive layers and a full anodization to form isolating regions between electrodes, replacing the usual process of depositing, planarizing, and etching insulation layers. After verifying the electric connections and insulations as intended, the developed method is applied to electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD), whose complex microfluidic products are currently built on PCB or thin-film transistor substrates. To demonstrate the utility, we fabricate a three metal-layer EWOD device with steps (surface topography) less than 1 micrometer (vs. {$>$} 10 micrometers of PCB EWOD devices) and confirm basic digital microfluidic operations.},

In terms of commercialization, however, paper-based microfluidics still have to overcome significant challenges to become an authentic point-of-care testing format with the advanced capabilities of analyte purification, multiplex analysis, quantification, and detection with high sensitivity and selectivity. Moreover, fluid flow manipulation for multistep integration, which involves valving and flow velocity control, is also a critical parameter to achieve high-performance devices. Considering these limitations, the aim of this review is to (i) comprehensively analyze the fabrication techniques of microfluidic paper-based analytical devices, (ii) provide a theoretical background and various methods for fluid flow manipulation, and (iii) highlight the recent detection techniques developed for various applications, including their advantages and disadvantages.},

It is urgently necessary to develop rapid, convenient, and cost-effective pointof-care testing (POCT) technologies for the early diagnosis and control of the plague’s transmission. Developing POCT methods and related devices is critical for achieving point-of-care diagnosis. With the advantages of miniaturization, high throughput, small sample requirements, and low actual consumption, microfluidics is an essential technology for the development of POCT devices. In this review, according to the different driving forces of the fluid, we introduce the common POCT devices based on microfluidic technology on the market, including paper-based microfluidic, centrifugal microfluidic, optical fluid, and digital microfluidic platforms. Furthermore, various microfluidicbased assays for diagnosing COVID-19 are summarized, including immunoassays, such as ELISA, and molecular assays, such as PCR. Finally, the challenges of and future perspectives on microfluidic device design and development are presented. The ultimate goals of this paper are to provide new insights and directions for the development of microfluidic diagnostics while expecting to contribute to the control of COVID-19.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) have become popular in the healthcare industry recently because of its lowcost, high-throughput, and portability. Users can execute the experiments on biochips with high resolution, and the biochips market therefore grows significantly. However, malicious attackers exploit Intellectual Property (IP) piracy and Trojan attacks to gain illegal profits. The conventional approaches present defense mechanisms that target either IP piracy or Trojan attacks. In practical, DMFBs may suffer from the threat of being attacked by these two attacks at the same time. This paper presents a comprehensive security system to protect DMFBs from IP piracy and Trojan attacks. We propose an authentication mechanism to protect IP and detect errors caused by Trojans with CCD cameras. By our security system, we could generate secret keys for authentication and determine whether the bioassay is under the IP piracy and Trojan attacks. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our security system without overhead of the bioassay completion time.},

Pin-count reduction and crosscontamination avoidance are key design considerations for practical applications with different droplets being transported and manipulated on highly integrated biochips. We present in this paper the first design automation flow that considers the crosscontamination problems on pin-constrained biochips. We explore the factors that make the problems harder on pin-constrained biochips. To cope with these cross contaminations, we propose (1) early crossing minimization algorithms during placement, and (2) systematic wash droplet scheduling and routing that require only one extra control pin and zero assay completion time overhead for practical bioassays. Experimental results show the effectiveness and scalability of our algorithms for practical bioassays.},

By altering the frequency of the applied voltage and the surrounding medium of a EWOD device, we found that when using oil as surrounding medium and applying an AC signal 100 kHz, liquid column would be drawn and follow the thin connecting lines of the EWOD driving electrodes instead of remaining on top of the center of the EWOD driving electrodes. This new phenomenon is described in this paper and is regarded as a LDEP effect. Three fundamental tools for integrated digital and analog microfluidics are developed, including a digital-to-analog converter, an analog-to-digital converter, and a valve. Combining EWOD and LDEP effects, liquids can be pumped on a virtual channel (analog microfluidics), defined by energized thin LDEP electrode lines, continuously from liquid reservoir or from a digitized droplet (digital microfluidics). On the contrary, liquids on LDEP electrodes (analog microfluidics) can also be pumped on a EWOD electrode and be digitized in droplet forms with precise volumes (digital microfluidics). EWOD and LDEP can be selectively programmed on a single chip, making integrated digital and analog microfluidics a reality.},

More recently, DMFBs based on a microelectrode-dot-array (MEDA) architecture have been proposed, and droplet manipulations on MEDA biochips have also been experimentally demonstrated. In order to ensure robust fluidic operations and high confidence in the outcome of biochemical experiments, MEDA biochips must be adequately tested before they can be used for bioassay execution. This paper presents the first approach for testing of MEDA biochips that include both CMOS circuits and microfluidic components. We first present structural test techniques to evaluate the pass/fail status of each microcell (droplet actuation, droplet maintenance, and droplet sensing) and identify faulty microcells. In order to ensure correct operation of functional units, e.g., mixers and diluters, we also present functional test techniques to address fundamental MEDA operations, such as droplet dispensing, transportation, mixing, and splitting. We evaluate the proposed test methods using simulations as well as experiments for fabricated MEDA biochips.},

  abstract = {Convenient electric control and electrode design allow flexible sample delivery on-chip in a wide range on microfluidics.           ,              Digital microfluidics has the potential to minimize and automate reactions in biochemical labs. However, the complexity of drop manipulation and sample preparation on-chip has limited its incorporation into daily workflow. In this paper, we report a novel method for flexible sample delivery on digital microfluidics in a wide volume range spanning four orders of magnitude from picoliters to nanoliters. The method is based on the phenomenon of satellite droplet ejection, triggered by a sudden change in the strength of the electric field across a drop on a hydrophobic dielectric surface. By precisely modulating the actuation signal with convenient external electric controls, satellite droplet ejection can be turned on to dispense samples or turned off to transport picking-up drops. A pico-dosing design is presented and validated in this work to demonstrate the direct and flexible on-chip sample delivery. This approach could pave the way for the acceptance of microfluidics as a common platform for daily reactions to realize lab-on-a-chip.},

MOFs have attracted much attention for applications in electrochemical sensors because of their unique chemical and physical properties including ultrahigh porosity, large surface area, tunable structure, and high thermal and chemical stability. Especially, redox and catalytic active sites introduced by use of active metal ions and/or ligands endow MOFs with the functions of electrochemical sensing. Moreover, precise chemical modification of functional molecules and immobilization with metal nanoparticles, carbon nanostructures and biomolecules could promote their electrochemical performances. In this review, we focus on recent progress achieved in MOF research with respect to general sensing principles and analytical performances of electrochemical sensors.

However, complex liquid handling schemes are troublesome, especially when scaling up to perform multiple different reactions simultaneously. Digital microfluidic (DMF) technology can operate a single droplet by controlling its movement, mixing, separation, and some other actions, and is a suitable scaffold for cell-free reactions with higher efficiency. In this paper, a commercial DMF board, OpenDrop, was used, and DMF technology               via               remote real-time control inspired by the Internet of Things (IoT) was developed for detecting glucose enzyme catalytic cell-free reactions and verifying the feasibility of programmed cell-free protein expression. A cell-free biological reaction process which can be remote-controlled visually with excellent interactivity, controllability and flexibility was achieved. As proof-of-concept research, this work proposed a new control interface for single-drop cell-free biological reactions. It is much like the “droplet operation desktop” concept, used for remote-controllable operations and distributions of cell-free biology for efficient biological screening and protein synthesis in complex reaction networks, with expanded operability and less artificial interference.},

Dielectric breakdown of several typical polymeric and inorganic insulators employed as dielectrics for EWOD has been analytically investigated, which is forced to occur between the electrodes and conductive liquids under certain threshold potential. The electric breakdown occurring in both dielectric layer and surrounding medium (air or silicon oil) has been studied to build up a mathematical model of breakdown voltage as a function of dielectric thickness.

  abstract = {Droplet microfluidics is a powerful method used to characterize chemical reactions at high throughput. Often detection is performed via in-line optical readout, which puts high demands on the detection system or makes detection of low concentration substrates challenging. Here, we have developed a droplet acoustofluidic chip for time-controlled reactions that can be combined with off-line optical readout. The principle of the platform is demonstrated by the enzymatic conversion of fluorescein diphosphate to fluorescein by alkaline phosphatase. The novelty of this work is that the time of the enzymatic reaction is controlled by physically removing the enzymes from the droplets instead of using chemical inhibitors. This is advantageous as inhibitors could potentially interact with the readout. Droplets containing substrate were generated on the chip, and enzyme-coupled microbeads were added into the droplets via pico-injection. The reaction starts as soon as the enzyme/bead complexes are added, and the reaction is stopped when the microbeads are removed from the droplets at a channel bifurcation. The encapsulated microbeads were focused in the droplets by acoustophoresis during the split, leaving the product in the side daughter droplet to be collected for the analysis (without beads). The time of the reaction was controlled by using different outlets, positioned at different lengths from the pico-injector. The enzymatic conversion could be measured with fluorescence readout in a separate PDMS based assay chip. We show the ability to perform time-controlled enzymatic assays in droplet microfluidics coupled to an off-line optical readout, without the need of enzyme inhibitors.},

This process has garnered widespread research attention due to the wide breadth of flexible applications such as medical diagnostics, drug delivery, and digital microfluidics. The rational design of functional surfaces that can achieve the subtle control of liquid behavior. Previous studies were mainly dependent on the special asymmetric structures, which inevitably have the problem of slow transport speed and short distance. To improve controllability, researchers have attempted to use external fields, such as thermal, light, electric fields, and magnetic fields, to achieve controllable droplet transport. On the fundamental side, much of their widespread applicably is due to the degree of control over droplet transport. This review provides an overview of recent progress in the last three years toward the transport of droplets with different mechanisms induced by various external stimuli, including light, electric, thermal, and magnetic field. First, the relevant basic theory and typical induced gradient for directional liquid transport are illustrated. We will then review the latest advances in the external-fieldinduced directional transport. Moreover, the most emerging applications such as digital microfluidics, harvesting of energy and water, heat transfer, and oil/water separation are also presented. Finally, we will outline possible future perspectives to attract more researchers interest and promote the development of this field.},

  abstract = {In this work, for the first time, we demonstrate nanoscale droplet generation from a continuous electrowetting microchannel using a simple and precise imagebased droplet volume metering technique. One of the most popular ways of droplet generation in electrowetting devices is to split a droplet from a preloaded volume as a fluid reservoir. This method is effective, but lowers volume consistency after multiple droplets are generated. Impedance- and capacitance-based methods of volume metering have been successfully used in digital microfluidics, but require complex circuitry and feedback signal processing. In this work, we demonstrate nanoliter droplet generation from a continuous electrowetting channel used as a replenishable fluid reservoir which compensates for the loss of reservoir volume as droplets are sequentially split. This improves volume consistency especially for applications requiring multi-droplet generation. Based on the area of the electrode, the volume of each droplet split from the electrowetting channel can be obtained by a simple and precise image processing technique with no need for additional hardware and measurement errors of ±0.05 \%. This simple technique can be used in a wide range of applications that require precise volume metering, such as immunoassay.},

  abstract = {Sample preparation plays an essential role in most biochemical reactions. Raw reactants are diluted to solutions with desirable concentration values in this process. Since the reactants, like infant’s blood, DNA evidence collected from crime scenes, or costly reagents, are extremely valuable, their usage should be minimized whenever possible. In this paper, we propose a two-phased reactant minimization algorithm (REMIA), for sample preparation on digital microfluidic biochips. In the former phase, REMIA builds a reactant-minimized interpolated dilution tree with specific leaf nodes for a target concentration. Two approaches are developed for tree construction; one is based on integer linear programming (ILP) and the other is heuristic. The ILP one guarantees to produce an optimal dilution tree with minimal reactant consumption, whereas the heuristic one ensures runtime efficiency. Then, REMIA constructs a forest consisting of exponential dilution trees to produce those aforementioned specific leaf nodes with minimal reactant consumption in the latter phase. Experimental results show that REMIA achieves a reduction of reactant usage by 32\%–52\% as compared with three existing state-of-the-art sample preparation approaches. Besides, REMIA can be easily extended to solve the sample preparation problem with multiple target concentrations, and the extended version also effectively lowers the reactant consumption further.},

For this purpose, one test set should have maximum 2 to 3 mixed components solution. So the different solution preparation modes and reagents combination were studied. The investigation results showed that the 2 mixed solution mode was impossibly prepared because nitropruside was decomposed in strong oxidative solution such as hypochlorite and increased color intensity when mixed with thymol in strong alkaline solution by ageing. The 3 mixed solution mode was proposed and optimal components mixing was fount i. e. solution 1 is nitropruside in ammonia free water; solution 2 is hypochlorite in carbonate buffer at pH 10 and solution 3 is thymol and EDTA in 2M of sodium hydroxide. This 3 solution test set was used for ammonia quick determination. Following proposed test procedure, the full color creation takes less than 5 minutes and total time for one test is approximately 7 – 8 minutes. The ammonia concentration in different samples determined by photometric and visual method using 3 solution test set were compared with conventional spectrophotometric method. The measured values showed that analytical results were agreed each with other and the proposed test set could be used as test-kit for field measurement or common monitoring ammonia in fresh and drinking water. The maximum relative error is less than 25\%.},

  abstract = {Digital imaging permits the quantitation of many experiments, such as microbiological growth assays, but laboratory digital imaging systems can be expensive and too specialised. The Raspberry Pi camera platform makes automated, controlled imaging affordable with accessible customisation. When combined with open source software and open-source 3D printed hardware, the control over image quality and capture of this platform permits the rapid development of novel instrumentation. Here we present ‘‘PiRamid”, a compact, portable, and inexpensive enclosure for autonomous imaging both in the laboratory and in the field. The modular three-piece 3D printed design makes it easy to incorporate different camera systems or lighting configurations (e.g., single wavelength LED for fluorescence). The enclosed design allows complete control of illumination unlike a conventional digital camera or smartphone, on a tripod or handheld, under ambient lighting. The stackable design permits rapid sample addition or camera focus adjustment, with a corresponding change in magnification and resolution. The entire unit is small enough to fit within a microbiological incubator, and cheap enough ( £100) to scale out for larger parallel experiments. Simply, Python scripts fully automate illumination and image capture for small-scale experiments with an 110 85 mm area at 70–90 lm resolution. We demonstrate the versatility of PiRamid by capturing time-resolved, quantitative image data for a wide range of assays. Bacterial growth kinetics was captured for conventional microbiology (agar Petri dishes), 3D printed custom microbiology labware and microfluidic microbiology. To illustrate application beyond microbiology, we demonstrate time-lapse imaging of crystal growth and degradation of salad leaves. Minor modifications permit epi-illumination by addition of a LED ring to the camera module. We conclude that PiRamid permits inexpensive digital capture and quantitation of a wide range of experiments by time-lapse imaging to simplify both laboratory and field imaging.},

  abstract = {In this work, we present an electronic circuit able to sense the droplet position in Electro-Wetting On Dielectric (EWOD) systems. The drop position is determined measuring the equivalent capacitance of the EWOD electrode, whose value varies according to the presence of the fluid over the pad. In the presented system, the capacitance measurement is achieved through the “Frequency Shift Oscillator” method: the EWOD electrode is inserted in an oscillator circuit, whose operating frequency is inversely proportional to the electrode capacitance value. A microcontroller, included in the system, counts the number of rising edges at the output of the circuit determining the oscillation frequency. The oscillator has been simulated and subsequently fabricated on a double layer printed circuit board. A very good agreement between simulations and experiments has been achieved. The value of obtained sensitivity is not lower than 1.2 kHz/pF that corresponds to a minimum detectable capacitance variation of 0.167 pF. This value is well below the variation of capacitance due to the presence of the droplet above the EWOD electrode and demonstrates the suitability of our circuit as a successful drop position sensor.},

  abstract = {Digital Microfluidic Biochips (DMFBs) have the potential to fundamentally transform biochemical disciplines through automation, miniaturization, and the ability to facilitate repeatable chemical experimentation. Programming DMFBs has historically been accomplished by writing low-level bit manipulations to select which electrodes should activate in sequence. Recent research on high-level programming languages and compilers for DMFBs have begun to address the programmability challenge, but important capabilities such as loading and executing pre-compiled libraries and function calls, are absent from the literature. A primary driver of this oversight is the lack of a memory hierarchy to store physical chemicals off-chip to jump to and from function calls. This paper addresses the complexities involved in compiling function calls within the technology’s unique boundaries, and provides a proof-of-concept implementation from language to code generation, with solutions evaluated using a cycleaccurate DMFB simulator as well as physical execution on an open-hardware DMFB.},

This could be due to the increase in concentrations of these metals above natural background. This article reviews the literature data on variation of water quality in rivers, lakes, and ex-mining ponds in Malaysia and other selected countries. World Health Organization (WHO), United States Environmental Protection Agency, and Malaysian water quality standards (INWQS) are used as the baseline for the pollution and health risk assessments. It illustrates that concentrations of Pb, Cd, and As in lakes and ex-mining ponds, and Mn, Cd and Pb in rivers exceed permissible limits for direct consumption. The levels of dissolved oxygen, TSS, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) are not within WHO and INWQS limits, pH of lakes and ex-mining ponds are lower than reference standards while that of rivers are high. Principal component analysis reveals that TSS, COD, BOD, Pb, and As are highly associated with ex-mining ponds. Cluster analysis shows similarity in pollution source between lake and ex-mining ponds. Risk assessment revealed that high chronic daily intake and metal index were beyond acceptable limit indicating high risk and exposure to toxic metals.},

In this paper, a chip scale sensing system, which is composed of a planar integrated optical microdisk resonator and a thin film InGaAs photodetector, is integrated with a digital microfluidic system. This system was designed, fabricated, and experimentally characterized by dispensing and moving droplets of glucose solution from the reservoir to the microresonator sensor. The optical output of the resonator was transduced by the integrated photodetector to an electrical current signal for readout.},

A versatile self‐shrinkage assembling (SSA) strategy to directly construct the compact mSCs (CmSCs) from hydrogels of reduced graphene oxide is reported. A single CmSC is only 0.0023 cm               3               in volume, which is significantly smaller than most reported mSCs in fiber/yarn and planar interdigital forms. It exhibits a high capacitance of up to 68.3 F cm               −3               and a superior cycling stability with 98\% capacitance retention after 25\,000 cycles. Most importantly, the SSA technique enables the CmSC as the building block to realize arbitrary, programmable, and multi‐dimensional integration for adaptable and complicated power systems. By design on mortise and tenon joint connection, autologous integrated 3D interdigital CmSCs are fabricated in a self‐holding‐on manner, which thus dramatically reduces the whole device volume to achieve the high‐performance capacitive behavior. Consequently, the SSA technique offers a universal and versatile approach for large‐scale on‐demand integration of mSCs as flexible and transformable power sources.},

In the present work, a combined numerical and experimental approach was employed to study the EW response of a droplet subject to both direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) actuating signals. Computational fluid dynamics models were developed by using the Volume of Fluid (VOF)-Continuous Surface Force (CSF) method. A dynamic contact angle model based on the molecular kinetic theory was implemented as the boundary condition at the moving contact line, which considers the effects of the contact line friction and the pinning force. The droplet shape evolution under DC condition and the interfacial resonance oscillation under AC condition were investigated. It was found that the numerical models were able to accurately predict the key parameters of electrowetting-induced droplet dynamics.},

  abstract = {The active matrix (AM)-based architecture offers many advantages over conventional digital electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) microfluidic biochips, such as the capability of handling variable-size droplets, more flexible droplet movement, and precise control over droplet navigation. However, a major challenge in choosing the routing paths is to decide when the droplets are to be reshaped depending on the congestion of the intended path, or split- and route sub droplets,and merging them at their respective destinations. As the number of microelectrodes in AM-EWOD chips is large, the path selection problem becomes further complicated. In this article, we propose a negotiation-guided flow based on routing of subdroplets that obviates the explicit need for deciding when the droplets are to be manipulated, yet fully utilizing the power of droplet reshaping, splitting, and merging them to facilitate their journey. The proposed algorithm reduces routing cost and provides more freedom in deadlock avoidance in the presence of multiple routing tasks by assigning certain congestion penalty for sibling subdroplets and fluidic penalty for heterogeneous droplets. Compared to existing techniques, it reduces latest arrival time by an average of 29\% for several benchmark and random test suites. Furthermore, our method is observed to provide 100\% routability of nets for all test cases, whereas existing and baseline routers fail to produce feasible solutions in many instances. We also propose a reliable mode droplet routing strategy where the number of unreliable splitting operations can be reduced by paying a small penalty on latest arrival time.},

However, synthesis algorithms and biochip design methods proposed in the literature are oblivious to completion-time uncertainties in fluidic operations, and they do not meet the requirements of cyberphysical integration in digital microfluidics. We present an operation-interdependency-aware synthesis method that uses frequency scaling and is responsive to uncertainties that are inherent in the completion times of fluidic operations such as mixing and thermal cycling. Using this design approach, we can carry out dynamic on-line decision making for the execution of fluidic operations in response to detector feedback. We use three common laboratorial protocols to demonstrate that, compared to uncertainty-oblivious biochip design, the proposed dynamic decision making approach is more effective in satisfying realistic physical constraints. As a result, it decreases the likelihood of erroneous reaction outcomes, and it leads to reduced time-to-results, less repetition of reaction steps, and less wastage of precious samples and reagents.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic biochips are being increasingly used for biotechnology applications. The number of control pins used to drive electrodes is a major contributor to fabrication cost for disposable biochips in a highly cost-sensitive market. Most prior work on pin-constrained biochip design determines the mapping of a small number of control pins to a larger number of electrodes according to the specific schedule of fluid-handling operations and routing paths of droplets. Such designs are therefore specific to the bioassay application, hence sacrificing some of the flexibility associated with digital microfluidics. We propose a design method to generate an application-independent pin-assignment configuration with a minimum number of control pins. Layouts of a commercial biochip and laboratory prototypes are used as case studies to evaluate the proposed design method for determining a suitable pin-assignment configuration. Compared with previous pin-assignment algorithms, the proposed method can reduce the number of control pins and facilitate the “general-purpose” use of digital microfluidic biochips for a wide range of applications.},

  abstract = {Droplet-based digital microfluidics technology has now come of age, and software-controlled biochips for healthcare applications are starting to emerge. However, today’s digital microfluidic biochips suffer from the drawback that there is no feedback to the control software from the underlying hardware platform. Due to the lack of precision inherent in biochemical experiments, errors are likely during droplet manipulation; error recovery based on the repetition of experiments leads to wastage of expensive reagents and hard-to-prepare samples. By exploiting recent advances in the integration of optical detectors (sensors) into a digital microfluidics biochip, we present a physicalaware system reconfiguration technique that uses sensor data at intermediate checkpoints to dynamically reconfigure the biochip. A cyberphysical resynthesis technique is used to recompute electrode-actuation sequences, thereby deriving new schedules, module placement, and droplet routing pathways, with minimum impact on the time-to-response.},

  abstract = {Abstract             A digital microfluidic system based on electrowetting-on-dielectric is a new technology for controlling microliter-sized droplets on a plane. By applying a voltage signal to an electrode, the droplets can be controlled to move, merge, and split. Due to device design, fabrication, and runtime uncertainties, feedback control schemes are necessary to ensure the reliability and accuracy of a digital microfluidic system for practical application. The premise of feedback is to obtain accurate droplet position information. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop a digital microfluidics system integrated with driving, position, and feedback functions for different areas of study. In this article, we propose a driving and feedback scheme based on machine vision for the digital microfluidics system. A series of experiments including droplet motion, merging, status detection, and self-adaption are performed to evaluate the feasibility and the reliability of the proposed scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can accurately locate multiple droplets and improve the success rate of different applications. Furthermore, the proposed scheme provides an experimental platform for scientists who focused on the digital microfluidics system.},

  abstract = {Microfluidic systems are part of an emerging technology which deals with minute amounts of liquids (biological samples and reagents) on a small scale. They are fast, compact and can be made into a highly integrated system to deliver sample purification, separation, reaction, immobilization, labelling, as well as detection, thus are promising for applications such as lab-on-a-chip and handheld healthcare devices. Miniaturized micropumps typically consist of a moving-part component, such as a membrane structure, to deliver liquids, and are often unreliable, complicated in structure and difficult to be integrated with other control electronics circuits. The trend of new-generation micropumps is moving-part-free micropumps operated by advanced techniques, such as electrokinetic force, surface tension/energy, acoustic waves. This paper reviews the development and advances of relevant technologies, and introduces electrowetting-on-dielectrics and acoustic wave-based microfluidics. The programmable electrowetting micropump has been realized to dispense and manipulate droplets in 2D with up to 1000 addressable electrodes and electronics built underneath. The acoustic wave-based microfluidics can be used not only for pumping, mixing and droplet generation but also for biosensors, suitable for single-mechanism-based lab-on-a-chip applications.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic systems (DMFS) are an emerging class of lab-on-a-chip systems that manipulate individual droplets of chemicals on a planar array of electrodes. The biochemical analyses are performed by repeatedly moving, mixing, and splitting droplets on the electrodes. Mixers and storage units, composed of electrodes, are two important functional resources. Mixers perform droplet mixing and splitting operations, while storage units store droplets that have been produced for subsequent mixings. In this paper, we focus on minimizing the completion time of biochemical analyses by exploiting the binary tree representation of analyses to schedule mixing operations. Using pipelining, we overlap mixing operations with input and transportation operations. We find the lower bound of the mixing completion time based on the tree structure of input analyses, and calculate the minimum number of mixers required to achieve the lower bound. We present a scheduling algorithm for the case with a specified number of mixers , and prove it is optimal to minimize the mixing completion time. We also analyze resource constraint issues for two extreme cases. For the case with just one mixer, we prove that all schedules that keep the mixer busy at all times result in the same mixing completion time and then design algorithms for scheduling and to minimize the number of storage units. For the case with zero storage units, we find the minimum number of mixers required. We extend our analyses and algorithms assuming identical mixing durations to the case of different mixing durations. Finally, we illustrate the benefits of our scheduling methods on an example of DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.},

However, in real applications, there are also problems related to dielectric deterioration, excess power consumption, optical instability and narrow color gamut etc. This paper reviewed the existing challenges and recent progress made in terms of improving the optical performance and reliability of EWD. First, the principle of electrowetting applied in small and confined configurations is introduced and the cause of the failure of the dielectric layer is analyzed. Then, the function of the pixel structures is described to avoid display defects. Next, electric signal modulations are compared in terms of achieving good image quality and optical stability. Lastly, the methods are presented for color panel realization. It was concluded that multi-layer dielectrics, three-dimensional pixel structures, proper electric frequency-and-amplitude modulation and an RGB color panel are expected to resolve the current limitations and contribute to designing advanced reflective displays.},

Due to its highly infectious nature, an accurate and rapid detection assay is urgently required. Therefore, this study presents a new type of digital microfluidic platform for H1N1 virus detection by utilizing a one-aptamer/two-antibodies assay on magnetic beads. The droplets containing magnetic beads were driven by electromagnetic forces on a structure-free, super-hydrophobic surface to automate the entire assay within 40 min. With different levels of hydrophobic modification, the droplets could be easily controlled and positioned without any assisted microstructure. The tunable electromagnetic forces could be adjusted for three kinds of operating modes for the manipulations of beads and droplets, including movement of droplets containing magnetic beads, mixing of two droplets and beads extraction out of droplets. When compared with previous studies, the manipulations of droplets and magnetic particles in this study are more flexible as they can be easily adjusted by fine-tuning the magnetic flux density. Furthermore, the magnetic beads also served as three-dimensional substrates for the new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-like assay. The magnetic beads were conjugated with aptamers, which have high specificity towards H1N1 viruses such that they could be specifically captured and detected. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was then used to activate tyramide-tetramethylrhodamine (TTMR) such that fluorescent signals could be amplified. With this approach, the limit of detection was experimentally found to be 0.032 hemagglutination units/reaction, which is sensitive enough for clinical diagnostics. This kind of digital microfluidic platform with the ELISA-like assay could effectively reduce the consumption of samples and reagents such that the volume of all droplets including the H1N1 sample, antibodies, TTMR and wash buffers was only 20 μL. This is the first time that a digital microfluidic platform was demonstrated such that the entire diagnostic process for influenza A H1N1 viruses could be performed by using electromagnetic forces, which could be promising for rapid and accurate diagnosis of influenza.},

With drastic climate changes, severe droughts, increases in population and pollution of natural water systems, the need to develop ultrasensitive, low-cost and hand-held, point-of-use detection kits to monitor water quality is critical. Although Escherichia coli is still considered the best indicator of water quality, cell numbers may be below detection limits, or the cells may be non-culturable and thus only detected by DNA amplification. A number of different biosensors have been developed to detect viable, dead or non-culturable microbial cells and chemicals in water.

First, a library of circuits is created which may model the physical processes occurring in the system. Next, each circuit is fit to the experimental data collected from three replicate experiments. Finally, relative residual errors, generated circuit parameter values relating to known physical parameters (solution resistance, double-layer capacitance, etc.) and standard deviations based on replicate experiments are used to determine which circuit best models the electrochemical data. For the model system presented in this paper, it is found that a modified Randles circuit best models the data when no BSA film is present, and that an additional time constant (resistor and constant phase element in parallel), modeling a porous, insulating film, is needed when a BSA film is formed on the electrode surface.},

LODs today enable scientists to implement and integrate different operational units, including fluid mixing, droplet generation, cell-sorting, gene amplification, analyte detection, and so forth. For an efficient design and cost-effective implementation of any microfluidic device, including LODs, theoretical analysis and considerations should play a more important role than they currently do. The theoretical analysis we will show is especially essential to the investigation of detailed phenomena at the small length scales and high-speed typical for LODs where a wide range of forces may be involved. Previous LOD review papers presented mostly experimental results with theory as an afterthought. Hence, a review paper focused on the theoretical aspects, and associated computational studies of LOD devices is an urgent need. In the present review paper, all previous computational studies on LOD devices are categorized as single-phase flows, two-phase flows, network simulation, and solids. For each of these categories, the governing equations and important formulas are presented and explained. Moreover, a handy scaling analysis is introduced to aid scientists when comparing different competing forces in LOD devices. We hope that by surveying and contrasting various theoretical LOD studies, we shed some light on existing controversies and reveal where additional theoretical work is needed.},

  abstract = {A novel device configuration for an electrowetting-on-dielectric system with a floating top-electrode, which provides possibilities to enable a true lab-on-a-chip.           ,              Herein, we describe a novel device configuration for a double-plate electrowetting-on-dielectric system with a floating top-electrode. As a conventional double-plate EWOD device requires a grounded electrode on the top-plate, it will cause additional fabrication complicity and cost during the encapsulation process. In this work, we found that by carefully designing the electrode arrangement and configuring the driving electronic circuit, the droplet driving force can be maintained with a floating electrode on the top-plate. This can provide the possibilities to integrate additional electrical or electrochemical sensing functions on the top-plate. We use both finite element analysis and the fabricated system to validate the theory, and the results indicate that floating top-electrode EWOD systems are highly reliable and reproducible once the design considerations are fully met.},

  abstract = {Emerging organic contaminants (EOC) are synthetic or naturally occurring chemicals that have the potential to enter the environment and cause known or suspected adverse ecological and human health effects. Despite not being commonly monitored, EOC are often detected in effluents and water bodies because of their inefficient removal in conventional wastewater treatment plants. There is a growing concern about the presence and impact of EOC as well as the need for reliable and effective water monitoring using sensors capable of detecting the target molecules in complex media. Due to their specificities, such as fast response times, low cost, portability and user-friendly operation, electronic tongue (e-tongue) systems present some advantages over the traditional analytical techniques (e.g., chromatographic systems) used for environmental monitoring. We reviewed e-tongue sensors, focusing on their ability for real-time environmental monitoring. A bibliometric evaluation was carried out, along with a study of the status of the existing e-tongue systems, how they worked, and their applications in different fields. The potential of e-tongue sensors to detect organic contaminants in aqueous environmental matrices is discussed, with a particular focus on EOC.},

  abstract = {The present work reported the polyaniline (PANI) and multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)-based nanocomposite as a sensing material for the determination of aqueous ammonia by the enhanced fluorescence method. The excitation wavelength-dependent photoluminescence (PL) intensity has shown dual emission peaks at 340 and 380 nm that correspond to two different excitation energy states. The pH-based PL intensity and zeta potential variation were analyzed to optimize the suitable medium for aqueous ammonia sensing. Zeta potential was found to shift from 4 to −21 mV upon changing the pH of the the solution from acidic to alkaline medium. The fluorescence intensity of PANI/MWCNTs was found to increase upon increasing the pH from 3.0 to 6.0 (acidic region) and exhibits a plateau upon further increasing the pH from 7.0 to 12 (basic region). The PANI/MWCNT composite has shown a linear response to aqueous ammonia concentration varying from 25 to 200 μM with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.99 and a limit of detection of 15.19 μM. The presence of relevant interference molecules and physiological ions had no influence on the detection of aqueous ammonia. Fieldlevel study demonstrated that the level of aqueous ammonia can be determined selectively by using the PANI/MWCNT composite for various applications. The mechanism for the selective detection of aqueous ammonia is deliberated in detail.},

  abstract = {Microfluidic biochip has facilitated a revolutionary improvement in biomedical operation or safety critical application like clinical diagnosis, parallel DNA sequencing, toxicity monitoring, immunoassay, air or water quality monitoring, food safety testing etc. But it has faced a major setback from malfunction in fluidic operation due to the defect in the electrodes. In this paper, we are proposing a novel and efficient technique for detecting a single fault and identifying the fault location within the biochip. Along with that it can also calculate the traversal time if the biochip is fault free. The traversal of the microarray is carried out by scanning the intermediate cells and the edges by special types of movement pattern RDRD (Right-Down-Right-Down) and DRDR (DownRight-Down-Right) for left and right diagonal electrode traversal respectively and the boundary cells and edges are traversed in clockwise direction by moving the test droplets. If a fault is detected then the proposed technique also locates it by backtracking the droplet. The simulated result suggests that the proposed technique is efficient and represents significant improvement in fault detection and calculating traversal time of a fault free biochip over existing methods.},

However, despite the enforcement of the Environmental Quality Act (EQA) in 1974, the water quality of Malaysian inland water (especially rivers) is following a deteriorating trend. The rivers are mainly polluted due to the point and nonpoint pollution sources. Point sources are monitored and controlled by the Department of Environment (DOE), whereas a significant amount of pollutants is contributed by both untreated sullage and storm runoff. Nevertheless, it is not too late to take some bold steps for the effective control of non-point source pollution and untreated sullage discharge, which play significant roles on the status of the rivers. This paper reviews the existing procedures and guidelines related to protection of the river water quality in Malaysia.},

  abstract = {Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) are the guided waves that propagate along the top surface of a material with wave vectors orthogonal to the normal direction to the surface. Based on these waves, SAW sensors are conceptualized by employing piezoelectric crystals where the guided elastodynamic waves are generated through an electromechanical coupling. Electromechanical coupling in both active and passive modes is achieved by integrating interdigitated electrode transducers (IDT) with the piezoelectric crystals. Innovative meta-designs of the periodic IDTs define the functionality and application of SAW sensors. This review article presents the physics of guided surface acoustic waves and the piezoelectric materials used for designing SAW sensors. Then, how the piezoelectric materials and cuts could alter the functionality of the sensors is explained. The article summarizes a few key configurations of the electrodes and respective guidelines for generating different guided wave patterns such that new applications can be foreseen. Finally, the article explores the applications of SAW sensors and their progress in the fields of biomedical, microfluidics, chemical, and mechanobiological applications along with their crucial roles and potential plans for improvements in the long-term future in the field of science and technology.},

Through measurement of cell viability by staining with methylene blue and plate counts, for an initial suspension of approx. 1.4 x 10 7 cells per ml containing 60\% non-viable cells, the dielectrophoretically separated non-viable fraction contained 3\% viable cells and the viable fraction 8\% dead cells.

  abstract = {DEP               is an established technique for particle manipulation. Although first demonstrated in the 1950s, it was not until the development of miniaturization techniques in the 1990s that               DEP               became a popular research field. The 1990s saw an explosion of               DEP               publications using microfabricated metal electrode arrays to sort a wide variety of cells. The concurrent development of microfluidics enabled devices for flow management and better understanding of the interaction between hydrodynamic and electrokinetic forces. Starting in the 2000s, alternative techniques have arisen to overcome common problems in metal‐electrode               DEP               , such as electrode fouling, and to increase the throughput of the system. Insulator‐based               DEP               and light‐induced               DEP               are the most significant examples. Most recently, new 3               D               techniques such as carbon‐electrode               DEP               , contactless               DEP               , and the use of doped               PDMS               have further simplified the fabrication process. The constant desire of the community to develop practical solutions has led to devices which are more user friendly, less expensive, and are capable of higher throughput. The state‐of‐the‐art of fabricating               DEP               devices is critically reviewed in this work. The focus is on how different fabrication techniques can boost the development of practical               DEP               devices to be used in different settings such as clinical cell sorting and infection diagnosis, industrial food safety, and enrichment of particle populations for drug development.},

Carbon‐DEP combines advantages of metal‐electrode and insulator‐based DEP by using low‐cost fabrication techniques and low voltages for particle manipulation. The use of 3‐D electrodes is proved to yield significant advantages over the use of traditional planar electrodes. This paper details the fabrication of dense arrays of tall high aspect ratio carbon electrodes on a transparent fused‐silica substrate. The shrinkage of the SU‐8 structures during carbonization is characterized and a design tool for future devices is provided. Applications of carbon electrodes in DEP are then detailed and include particle positioning, high‐throughput filtering and cell focusing using positive‐DEP. Manipulated cells include               Saccharomyces cerevisiae               and               Drosophila melanogaster               .

IDEs made of indium tin oxide (ITO) and ITO coated with iridium oxide (IrOx) were used for ECIS measurements with the human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. The results indicate that IrOx-modified ITO electrodes provide both biocompatibility and higher cell sensitivity compared to ITO electrodes. We also found that the quantity of IrOx required to generate such a sensitivity improvement is sufficiently low to not interfere with the visualization of the cells under study. IrOx-modified ITO electrodes are therefore promising sensors for ECIS applications.},

Paper-based 3D microfluidic devices have capabilities in microfluidics that are difficult to achieve using conventional open-channel microsystems made from glass or polymers. In particular, 3D paper-based devices wick fluids and distribute microliter volumes of samples from single inlet points into arrays of detection zones (with numbers up to thousands). This capability makes it possible to carry out a range of new analytical protocols simply and inexpensively (all on a piece of paper) without external pumps. We demonstrate a prototype 3D device that tests 4 different samples for up to 4 different analytes and displays the results of the assays in a side-by-side configuration for easy comparison. Three-dimensional paper-based microfluidic devices are especially appropriate for use in distributed healthcare in the developing world and in environmental monitoring and water analysis.},

The current approach of integrating interdigitated transducers (IDTs) for SAW generation into microfluidic channels involves complex and laborious microfabrication steps.

This work presents an affordable and innovative method for fabricating SAW-based microfluidic devices without the need for clean room facilities and alignment. The IDTs and microfluidic channels are fabricated using the same process and thus are precisely self-aligned in accordance with the device design.

  abstract = {The digital microfluidic (DMF) platform introduces many applications in biomedical assays. If it is to be commercially available to the public, it needs to have the essential features of smart sensing and a compact size. In this work, we report on a fractal electrode biosensor that is used for both droplet actuation and sensing C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration levels to assess cardiac disease risk. Our proposed electrode is the first two-terminal electrode design to be integrated into DMF platforms. A simulation of the electrical field distribution shows reduced peak intensities and uniform distribution of the field. When compared to a V-notch square electrode, the fractal electrode shows a superior performance in both aspects, i.e. field uniformity and intensity. These improvements are translated into a successful and responsive actuation of a water droplet with 100V. Likewise, the effective dielectric strength is improved by a 33\% increase in the fractal electrode breakdown voltage. Additionally, the capability of the fractal electrode to work as a capacitive biosensor is evaluated with CRP quantification test. Selected fractal electrodes undergo a surface treatment to immobilize anti-CRP antibodies on their surface. The measurement shows a response to the added CRP in capacitance within three minutes. When the untreated electrodes were used for quantification, there was no significant change in capacitance, and this suggested that immobilization was necessary. The electrodes configuration in the fabricated DMF platform allows the fractal electrodes to be selectively used as biosensors, which means the device could be integrated into point-of-care applications.},

Such a procedure is especially suited for automation and miniaturization. Life sciences lead the way to synthesizing millions of different oligonucleotides in extremely miniaturized reaction sites, e.g., pinpointing active genes in whole genomes, while chemistry advances different types of automation. Recent progress in matrix‐assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI‐MS) imaging could match miniaturized chemical synthesis with a powerful analytical tool to validate the outcome of many different synthesis pathways beyond applications in the life sciences. Thereby, due to the radical miniaturization of chemical synthesis, thousands of molecules can be synthesized. This in turn should allow ambitious research, e.g., finding novel synthesis routes or directly screening for photocatalysts. Herein, different technologies are discussed that might be involved in this endeavor. A special emphasis is given to the obstacles that need to be tackled when depositing tiny amounts of materials to many different extremely miniaturized reaction sites.},

The expansion of global urban areas has resulted in marked alterations to natural processes, environmental quality and natural resource consumption. The urban landscape influences infiltration and evapotranspiration, complicating our capacity to quantify their dynamics across a heterogeneous landscape at contrasting scales. Impervious surfaces exacerbate runoff processes, whereas runoff from pervious areas remains uncertain owing to variable infiltration dynamics. Increasingly, the link between the natural hydrological cycle and engineered water cycle has been made, realising the contributions from leaky infrastructure to recharge and runoff rates. Urban landscapes are host to a suite of contaminants that impact on water quality, where novel contaminants continue to pose new challenges to monitoring and treatment regimes. This review seeks to assess the major advances and remaining challenges that remain within the growing field of urban hydrology.},

A state space model has been derived from circuit analogy approach to describe the microfluidic network. Furthermore, a COMSOL-based study is primed for device structure by means of droplet generation and controlling the droplet through fitted valves. Moreover, an image processing algorithm based on active contours has been proposed in this research to track the movement of the droplet through the channel. This droplet controlling method is utterly based on fuzzy controller as well as camera images to move the droplet at desired position by controlling flow rates inside the fluidic channel using valves installed inside the microfluidic device.

These biomarkers are masked in proteomic analysis by highly abundant proteins such as human serum albumin (HSA) and immunoglobulins (IgGs) which account for up to 80\% of the total protein content of serum. Traditional depletion methods using macro-scale LC-columns for highly abundant proteins involve slow separations which impart considerable dilution to the samples. Furthermore, most techniques lack the ability to process multiple samples simultaneously. We present a method of protein depletion using superparamagnetic beads coated in anti-HSA, Protein A, and Protein G, manipulated by digital microfluidics (DMF). The depletion process was capable of up to 95\% protein depletion efficiency for IgG and HSA in 10 min for four samples simultaneously, which resulted in an approximately 4-fold increase in signal-to-noise ratio in MALDI-MS analysis for a low abundance protein, hemopexin. This rapid and automated method has the potential to greatly improve the process of biomarker identification.},

  abstract = {Here we describe a method to form phase-segregated domain-containing supported lipid bilayers on silica substrates and demonstrate that the presence of these domains can alter nanoparticle interaction with bilayers.           ,                             For nanoparticles that have been released into the environment, the cell membrane represents an initial site of interaction with eukaryotic cells. The encounter of nanoparticles with cellular membranes may alter membrane structure and function, lead to uptake into cells, or elicit adverse biological responses. Supported lipid bilayers have proven to be valuable               ex vivo               models for biological membranes, allowing investigation of their mechanisms of interaction with nanoparticles with a degree of control impossible in living cells. To date, the majority of research on nanoparticle interaction with supported lipid bilayers has employed membranes composed of single or binary mixtures of phospholipids. Cellular membranes contain a wide variety of lipids and exhibit lateral organization. Ordered membrane domains enriched in specific membrane components, also referred to as lipid rafts, have not been explored with respect to their interaction with nanoparticles. Here we develop model membranes containing segregated domains differing in fluidity that are amenable to investigation by a variety of surface-sensitive analytical techniques and demonstrate that these domains influence the extent of nanoparticle attachment to model membranes. We determined conditions that allow reliable formation of bilayers containing liquid-ordered domains enriched in sphingomyelin and cholesterol and confirmed their morphology by structured illumination and atomic force microscopies. We demonstrate that the presence of liquid-ordered domains increases attachment of cationic gold nanoparticles to model membranes relative to those lacking such domains under near physiological ionic strength conditions (0.1 M NaCl) at pH 7.4. We anticipate that these results will serve as the foundation for and motivate further study of nanoparticle interaction with phase-segregated domains.},

  abstract = {Clinical laboratories provide an invaluable service to millions of people around the world in the form of quality diagnostic care. Within the clinical laboratory industry the impetus for change has come from technological development (miniaturization, nanotechnology, and their collective effect on point-of-care testing; POCT) and the increasingly global nature of laboratory services. Potential technological gains in POCT include: the development of bio-sensors, microarrays, genetics and proteomics testing, and enhanced web connectivity. In globalization, prospective opportunities lie in: medical tourism, the migration of healthcare workers, cross-border delivery of testing, and the establishment of accredited laboratories in previously unexplored markets. Accompanying these impressive opportunities are equally imposing challenges. Difficulty transitioning from research to clinical use, poor infrastructure in developing countries, cultural differences and national barriers to global trade are only a few examples. Dealing with the issues presented by globalization and the impact of developing technology on POCT, and on the clinical laboratory services industry in general, will be a daunting task. Despite such concerns, with appropriate countermeasures it will be possible to address the challenges posed. Future laboratory success will be largely dependent on one’s ability to adapt in this perpetually shifting landscape.},

Several conductive two-dimensional MOF analogues were drop-cast onto a glassy carbon electrode and then covered with an ion-selective membrane to form a potentiometric sensor. The resulting devices exhibited excellent sensing properties toward anions and cations, characterized by a near-Nernstian response and over 4 orders of magnitude linear range. Impedance and chronopotentiometric measurements revealed the presence of large bulk capacitance (204 ± 2 μF) and good potential stability (drift of 11.1 ± 0.5 μA/h). Potentiometric water test and contact angle measurements showed that this class of materials exhibited hydrophobicity and inhibited the formation of water layer at the electrode/membrane interface, resulting in a highly stable sensing response with a potential drift as low as 11.1 μA/h. The property of ion-to-electron transduction of conductive MOFs may form the basis for the development of this class of materials as promising components within ion-selective electrodes.},

However, the detailed benefits and costs associated with integrated RTC have yet to be comprehensively evaluated. Built on state-of-the-art modeling and analytical tools, a three-step framework is proposed to develop integrated RTC strategies which cost-effectively maximize environmental outcomes. Results from a case study show integrated RTC can improve river quality by over 20\% to meet the “good status” requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive with a 15\% reduced cost, due to responsive aeration with changing environmental assimilation capacity. The cost-effectiveness of integrated RTC strategies is further demonstrated against tightening environmental standards (to the strictest levels) and against two commonly used compliance strategies. Compared to current practices (seasonal/monthly based operation), integrated RTC strategies can reduce costs while improving resilience of the system to disturbances and reducing environmental risk.},

  abstract = {Microfluidic devices can provide innovative means to handle and control the transport of (bio)particles within a fluid flow. The advantage of microscale devices is that different components can be integrated in a single chip at low cost, with a negligible power consumption, compared to alternative solutions. In this work, a numerical investigation is developed on the use of standing surface acoustic waves (SAWs) generated within a microfluidic channel in order to manipulate microparticles. Far-field waves are generated via inter-digital transducers (IDTs), travel on the surface of a piezoelectric substrate and finally interfere in the channel, giving rise to a standing wave solution in terms of acoustic pressure. Results are reported for different geometries of the channel, to define the sensitivity of the acoustic pressure field to the relevant geometric features of the channel. This investigation shows how the acoustic radiation and drag forces interact with each other to move and focus the particles, possibly leading to a separation of heterogeneous ones, and generally provide a way to manipulate them at a small scale.},

  abstract = {The present work describes the phenomenological approach to automatically determine the frequency range for positive and negative dielectrophoresis (DEP)—an electrokinetic force that can be used for massively parallel micro- and nano-assembly. An experimental setup consists of the microfabricated chip with gold microelectrode array connected to a function generator capable of digitally controlling an AC signal of 1 V (peak-to-peak) and of various frequencies in the range between 10 kHz and 1 MHz. The suspension of latex microbeads (3-µm diameter) is either attracted or repelled from the microelectrodes under the influence of DEP force as a function of the applied frequency. The video of the bead movement is captured via a digital camera attached to the microscope. The OpenCV software package is used to digitally analyze the images and identify the beads. Positions of the identified beads are compared for successive frames via Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm that determines the cloud behavior of the microbeads and algorithmically determines if the beads experience attraction or repulsion from the electrodes. Based on the determined behavior of the beads, algorithm will either increase or decrease the applied frequency and implement the digital command of the function generator that is controlled by the computer. Thus, the operation of the study platform is fully automated. The AI-guided platform has determined that positive DEP (pDEP) is active below 500 kHz frequency, negative DEP (nDEP) is evidenced above 1 MHz frequency and the crossover frequency is between 500 kHz and 1 MHz. These results are in line with previously published experimentally determined frequency-dependent DEP behavior of the latex microbeads. The phenomenological approach assisted by live AI-guided feedback loop described in the present study will assist the active manipulation of the system towards the desired phenomenological outcome such as, for example, collection of the particles at the electrodes, even if, due to the complexity and plurality of the interactive forces, model-based predictions are not available.},

The PCB-based SAW (PCB-SAW) device is systematically characterised and benchmarked with a SAW device made using the conventional photolithography process with the same specifications. Microparticle manipulations such as streaming in droplets and patterning in microchannels were demonstrated in the PCB-SAW device. In addition, the PCB-SAW device was applied as an acoustic tweezer to pattern lung cancer cells to form three or four traces inside the microchannel in a controllable manner. Cell viability of ∼97\% was achieved after acoustic manipulation using the PCB-SAW device, which proved its ability as a suitable tool for acoustophoretic applications.},

  abstract = {We have successfully demonstrated that imidazolium- and pyrrolidinium-based commercial roomtemperature ionic liquids can electrowet (with a dc voltage) a smooth fluoropolymer (Teflon AF1600) surface. Qualitatively, the process is analogous to the electrowetting of aqueous electrolyte solutions: the contact angle versus voltage curve has a parabolic shape which saturates at larger voltages (positive or negative). On the other hand we observed several peculiarities: (i) the efficiency is significantly lower (by about an order of magnitude); (ii) the influence of the bulky cation is larger and the importance of the smaller anion is lesser, especially with respect to electrowetting saturation; (iii) there is an asymmetry in the saturation contact angles found for positive and negative voltages. The asymmetry may be correlated with the cationanion asymmetry of the ionic liquids. The low efficiency may be caused by the presence of water and other impurities in these commercial materials.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidics (DMF) is a promising lab-on-a-chip technology which has been applied in a wide variety of fields, including chemical sensing, biological detection, and even mechanical transportation. However, the appearance and functions of current DMF have been limited within two-dimensional planar space because of the conventional fabrication methods, such as photolithography or screen printing. In this paper, we report a DMF system which utilizes the advantage of three-dimensional (3D) printing to develop the novel form factor of electrodes and conversion of channels from planar to 3D forms. Vertical channels have been fabricated through combined 3D printing methods to facilitate stable and controlled movement of water droplets. The interfaces among liquid, gas, and solid were analyzed through Young−Lippmann law. We calculated the actuation force in a series of different configurations to enable us to optimize the system. Inspired by xylem structures in plants, the vertical movement and pumping of droplets are demonstrated by a programmable control system with a built-in boost converter for a real-time operating and portable DMF system. This work validates the promise of 3D printing to make 3D vertical DMF devices and the potential of the artificial xylem chip for micropumping applications.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a high-performance droplet router for a digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) design. Due to recent advancements in the biomicroelectromechanical system and its various applications to clinical, environmental, and military operations, the design complexity and the scale of a DMFB are expected to explode in the near future, thus requiring strong support from CAD as in conventional VLSI design. Among the multiple design stages of a DMFB, droplet routing, which schedules the movement of each droplet in a time-multiplexed manner, is one of the most critical design challenges due to high complexity as well as large impacts on performance. Our algorithm first routes a droplet with higher bypassibility which is less likely to block the movement of the others. When multiple droplets form a deadlock, our algorithm resolves it by backing off some droplets for concession. The final compaction step further enhances timing as well as fault tolerance by tuning each droplet movement greedily. The experimental results on hard benchmarks show that our algorithm achieves over 35× and 20× better routability with comparable timing and fault tolerance than the popular prioritized A∗ search and the state-of-the-art network-flow-based algorithm, respectively.},

This is done experimentally by monitoring the coalescence and mixing of dyed liquid drops that are brought together by electrowetting actuation. The process is monitored using high-speed imaging and the extent of mixing with AC forcing after coalescence is tracked. Here, EWOD refers to manipulation of contact angle of a liquid drop on a surface by application of an electrical potential between the drop and an electrode embedded in the surface, separated from the drop by a thin dielectric layer. To understand the internal mixing, which appears to be driven by shape oscillations of the sessile drop, we also conduct fundamental studies of the shape oscillations of drops that are attached to a planar solid surface. Through image processing, we show that depending on the frequency of the applied alternating field, various modes of oscillation, including non-axisymmetric ones, may be excited.},

  abstract = {This review presents an overview of the different techniques developed over the last decade to regulate the temperature within microfluidic systems. A variety of different approaches has been adopted, from external heating sources to Joule heating, microwaves or the use of lasers to cite just a few examples. The scope of the technical solutions developed to date is impressive and encompasses for instance temperature ramp rates ranging from 0.1 to 2,000 °C/s leading to homogeneous temperatures from −3 °C to 120 °C, and constant gradients from 6 to 40 °C/mm with a fair degree of accuracy. We also examine some recent strategies developed for applications such as digital microfluidics, where integration of a heating source to generate a temperature gradient offers control of a key parameter, without necessarily requiring great accuracy. Conversely, Temperature Gradient Focusing requires high accuracy in order to control both the concentration and separation of charged species. In addition, the Polymerase Chain Reaction requires both accuracy (homogeneous temperature) and integration to carry out demanding heating cycles. The spectrum of applications requiring temperature regulation is growing rapidly with increasingly important implications for the physical, chemical and biotechnological sectors, depending on the relevant heating technique.},

Functional testing is needed to detect fluidic malfunctions. Such tests ensure whether or not, the elementary fluidic operations, such as droplet transportation, mixing, incubation, and splitting are reliably executed on the microfluidic array. Routing test and mixing/splitting test are two important steps in functional testing. We present two procedures for optimal bidirectional routing test and accelerated mixing/splitting test. Compared to previous methods, these procedures need significantly fewer droplet manipulation steps and reduced execution time. The proposed method of functional testing in an N × N microfluidic array requires only a constant number of mixing/splitting steps. Further, the test outcome is free from boundary errors related to droplet size that may arise during mixing/splitting test.},

  abstract = {In many biochemical protocols, sample preparation is an extremely important step for mixing multiple reagents in a given ratio. Dilution of a biochemical sample/reagent is the special case of mixing or solution preparation where only two fluids (sample and buffer) are mixed at a certain ratio corresponding to the desired concentration factor. Many bioassays often require multiple concentration values of the same sample/reagent, and implementing them efficiently on a digital microfluidic biochip is a challenge. In this paper, we present an algorithmic solution for the problem of producing a set of different target droplets in a minimum number of mix-split steps, and satisfying a given upper bound in concentration error. Unlike prior methods, this approach does not require any intermediate storage. We represent the underlying search space using a binary de Brujin graph and show that a shortest mix-split sequence can be obtained by solving an asymmetric traveling salesman problem therein. Simulation results over a large data set reveal that the proposed technique outperforms existing methods in terms of the number of mix-split steps, waste droplets, and reactant usage. The method is applicable in general scenarios of either one mixer or more mixers on the chip. A digital microfluidic platform can be easily designed to implement such a technique for rapid on-chip sample preparation.},

Since a wash droplet may have a finite capability of residue removal, one has to design an efficient route planning for wash droplet(s) that minimizes the washing time and/or electrode actuation.

In this study, first the critical temperatures of eight DES systems have been calculated based on the Eötvos empirical equation using the experimental data of the density and surface tension at various temperatures, then the density and surface tension values of these systems were predicted from the calculated critical temperatures. For the density prediction the Eötvos and Guggenheim equations were combined to introduce a simple power law equation using the estimated critical temperatures from the Eötvos and the Modified Lydersen–Joback–Reid group contribution methods. Finally, the estimated critical temperatures by these two methods were used in the Guggenheim empirical equation to calculate the surface tension of the DES systems.

  abstract = {Digital microfluidics (DMF) represents an alternative to the conventional microfluidic paradigm of transporting fluids in enclosed channels. One of the major benefits of DMF is that fluid motion and control is achieved without external pumps. The automation component of DMF have pushed the barriers of this “lab-on-chip” technology. However, integration with external components (i.e., “worldto-chip”) interfaces have been a challenge. Two common “world-to-chip” challenges are (1) delivering biological samples to DMF devices and (2) accurately controlling temperatures on device. To address these challenges, this work describes two “world-to-chip” interface features that have been integrated on a DMF platform: a reagent delivery system and a thermal control apparatus. This platform enables a variety of biological or chemical experiments to be conducted on-chip while reducing manual intervention. Specifically, our platform increases reagent volumes available to device reservoirs volume by at least 50-fold eliminating the need to manually refill reservoirs while improving droplet dispensing reproducibility. In addition, we have integrated a closed-loop temperature control system that offers precise temperature control on-chip. To validate our “world-to-chip” interface, we have automated bacterial transformation and enzymatic assay protocols, showing that such a system enhances DMF performance. Overall, we propose that this system will improve biological experimentation which requires fluidic and temperature control integrated on DMF platforms.},

To allow single substrate type EWODs to be practically used in an automatic operation system, we developed a dimple structure as a key technique for a highly accurate droplet manipulation method. The three-dimensional shape of the dimple structure is embossed onto a disposable thin sheet. In this study, we confirmed that the dimple structure can suppress unintended droplet motion caused by unidentified factors. In addition, the stability of the droplets on the dimple structures was evaluated using a sliding experiment. On a flat substrate, the success rate of a droplet motion was lower than 70.8\%, but on the dimple structure, the droplets were able to be moved along the dimple structures correctly without unintended motion caused by several environmental conditions. These results indicated that the dimple structure increased the controllability of the droplets. Hence, the dimple structure will contribute to the practical application of digital microfluidics based on single substrate type EWODs.},

This mini review article provides a comprehensive overview of various applications of CPSs, as well as current advancements in CPS construction approaches. We begin by outlining the major technologies utilized in proximity sensing, highlighting their characteristics and applications, and discussing their advantages and disadvantages, with a heavy emphasis on capacitive sensors. Evaluating various nanocomposites for proximity sensing and corresponding detecting approaches ranging from physical to chemical detection are emphasized. The matrix and active ingredients used in such sensors, as well as the measured ranges, will also be discussed. A good understanding of CPSs is not only essential for resolving issues, but is also one of the primary forces propelling CPS technology ahead. We aim to examine the impediments and possible solutions to the development of CPSs. Furthermore, we illustrate how nanocomposite fusion may be used to improve the detection range and accuracy of a CPS while also broadening the application scenarios.

As a first approach, experiments are performed to infer on the basic chip dimensions and configuration (size and positioning of the electrodes), allowing its best performance, evaluated based on droplet dynamics (spreading/receding diameter and contact line velocity). Then, to scale down this section, for its proper integration in the device, these basic dimensions are introduced as first guess values in a numerical model, used to optimize the distance between the electrodes, the thickness of the dielectric and the electric potential and frequency to be applied.},

This platform integrates microfluidic technology with electrical impedance sensing and embodies a unique two-chamber architecture in which the capture/reaction and detection steps are physically separated from one another. This two-chamber design is a deviation from traditional proteomic biosensors and offers the potential for greater sensitivity as the capture/reaction and detection steps can be independently optimized. We demonstrate the implementation and feasibility of this platform in assaying both protein abundance, using the human cytokine interleukin 6, and activity, using Abelson tyrosine kinase.           ,              Global studies of the human proteome have revealed a plethora of putative protein biomarkers. However, their application for early disease detection remains at a standstill without suitable methods to realize their utility in the clinical setting. There thus continues to be tremendous interest in developing new technology for sensitive protein detection that is both low in cost and carries a small footprint to be able to be used at the point of care. The current gold standard method for protein biomarker detection is the ELISA, which measures protein abundance using bulky fluorescent scanners that lack portability. Here, we present a digital microfluidic platform for protein biomarker detection that is low in cost compared with standard optical detection methods, without any compromise in sensitivity. This platform furthermore makes use of simple electronics, enabling its translation into a portable handheld device, and has been developed in a manner that can easily be adapted to assay different types of proteomic biomarkers. We demonstrate its utility in quantifying not only protein abundance, but also activity. Interleukin-6 abundance could be assayed from concentrations as low as 50 pM (an order of magnitude lower than that detectable by a comparable laboratory designed ELISA) using less than 5 μL of sample, and Abelson tyrosine kinase activity was detectable in samples containing 100 pM of kinase.},

  abstract = {This paper reports on the use of a digital microfluidic platform to perform multiplex automated genetic engineering (MAGE) cycles on droplets containing Escherichia coli cells. Bioactivated magnetic beads were employed for cell binding, washing, and media exchange in the preparation of electrocompetent cells in the electrowetting-on-dieletric (EWoD) platform. On-cartridge electroporation was used to deliver oligonucleotides into the cells. In addition to the optimization of a magnetic bead-based benchtop protocol for generating and transforming electrocompetent E. coli cells, we report on the implementation of this protocol in a fully automated digital microfluidic platform. Bead-based media exchange and electroporation pulse conditions were optimized on benchtop for transformation frequency to provide initial parameters for microfluidic device trials. Benchtop experiments comparing electrotransformation of free and bead-bound cells are presented. Our results suggest that dielectric shielding intrinsic to bead-bound cells significantly reduces electroporation field exposure efficiency. However, high transformation frequency can be maintained in the presence of magnetic beads through the application of more intense electroporation pulses. As a proof of concept, MAGE cycles were successfully performed on a commercial EWoD cartridge using variations of the optimal magnetic bead-based preparation procedure and pulse conditions determined by the benchtop results. Transformation frequencies up to 22\% were achieved on benchtop; this frequency was matched within 1\% (21\%) by MAGE cycles on the microfluidic device. However, typical frequencies on the device remain lower, averaging 9\% with a standard deviation of 9\%. The presented results demonstrate the potential of digital microfluidics to perform complex and automated genetic engineering protocols.},

  abstract = {Micro total analytical systems (mTAS) are attractive to multiple fields that include chemistry, medicine and engineering due to their portability, low power usage, potential for automation, and low sample and reagent consumption, which in turn results in low waste generation. The development of fully-functional mTAS is an iterative process, based on the design, fabrication and testing of multiple prototype microdevices. Typically, microfabrication protocols require a week or more of highly-skilled personnel time in high-maintenance cleanroom facilities, which makes this iterative process cost-prohibitive in many locations worldwide. Rapid-prototyping tools, in conjunction with the use of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), enable rapid development of microfluidic structures at lower costs, circumventing these issues in conventional microfabrication techniques. Multiple rapid-prototyping methods to fabricate PDMSbased microfluidic devices have been demonstrated in literature since the advent of soft-lithography in 1998; each method has its unique advantages and drawbacks. Here, we present a tutorial discussing current rapid-prototyping techniques to fabricate PDMS-based microdevices, including softlithography, print-and-peel and scaffolding techniques, among other methods, specifically comparing resolution of the features, fabrication processes and associated costs for each technique. We also present thoughts and insights towards each step of the iterative microfabrication process, from design to testing, to improve the development of fully-functional PDMS-based microfluidic devices at faster rates and lower costs.},

Such a wide area of applications has proven it to be a reliable device, which can be applied in non-invasive blood glucose monitoring system. Focus of this ongoing work is to study the analytical expression for calculating the capacitance and electric field changes of the suggested interdigital capacitor structure. This also involves the study of parameters, which affect the frequency response changes in the proposed configuration and to present a model of biological tissue. Moreover, the dependency of the capacitance on the geometrical properties of interdigital capacitor structure, electrical properties of the structure as well as those of the human biological tissue are being examined in this project. Production of a sensor based on capacitive sensing, which can be used for the non-invasive approach of blood glucose monitoring is the main target of this paper.

The new adsorbent was thoroughly studied in terms of morphology, crystallography and chemical composition using characterization techniques such as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and zeta potential analysis. Several parameters such as pH, adsorbent dosage, contact time, and ammonia initial concentration were investigated and optimized. Ammonia adsorption onto SrO/GO was validated with kinetics and adsorption isotherms by adopting different models. The results revealed that ammonia adsorption kinetic was of pseudo-second order (R2 = 0.999) implying that chemisorption behavior and the equilibrium isotherm follows Langmuir model. This behavior shows a high maximum monolayer sorption capacity of 90.1 mg g−1 at pH equal to 7 and contact time of 120 min pointing out the synergism advantageous effect. The abundant oxygen functional groups on the graphene oxide surface and the integrated Sr-O nanoparticles could efficiently interact with ammonia species creating a surface for more favorable and efficient removal of ammonia.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting has become one of the most widely used tools for manipulating tiny amounts of liquids on surfaces. Applications range from ‘lab-on-a-chip’ devices to adjustable lenses and new kinds of electronic displays. In the present article, we review the recent progress in this rapidly growing field including both fundamental and applied aspects. We compare the various approaches used to derive the basic electrowetting equation, which has been shown to be very reliable as long as the applied voltage is not too high. We discuss in detail the origin of the electrostatic forces that induce both contact angle reduction and the motion of entire droplets. We examine the limitations of the electrowetting equation and present a variety of recent extensions to the theory that account for distortions of the liquid surface due to local electric fields, for the finite penetration depth of electric fields into the liquid, as well as for finite conductivity effects in the presence of AC voltage. The most prominent failure of the electrowetting equation, namely the saturation of the contact angle at high voltage, is discussed in a separate section. Recent work in this direction indicates that a variety of distinct physical effects—rather than a unique one—are responsible for the saturation phenomenon, depending on experimental details. In the presence of suitable electrode patterns or topographic structures on the substrate surface, variations of the contact angle can give rise not only to continuous changes of the droplet shape, but also to discontinuous morphological transitions between distinct liquid morphologies. The dynamics of electrowetting are discussed briefly. Finally, we give an overview of recent work aimed at commercial applications, in particular in the fields of adjustable lenses, display technology, fibre optics, and biotechnology-related microfluidic devices.},

  abstract = {Surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators represent some of the most prominent acoustic devices for chemical sensing applications. As their frequency ranges from several hundred MHz to GHz, therefore they can record remarkably diminutive frequency shifts resulting from exceptionally small mass loadings. Their miniaturized design, high thermal stability and possibility of wireless integration make these devices highly competitive. Owing to these special characteristics, they are widely accepted as smart transducers that can be combined with a variety of recognition layers based on host-guest interactions, metal oxide coatings, carbon nanotubes, graphene sheets, functional polymers and biological receptors. As a result of this, there is a broad spectrum of SAW sensors, i.e., having sensing applications ranging from small gas molecules to large bio-analytes or even whole cell structures. This review shall cover from the fundamentals to modern design developments in SAW devices with respect to interfacial receptor coatings for exemplary sensor applications. The related problems and their possible solutions shall also be covered, with a focus on emerging trends and future opportunities for making SAW as established sensing technology.},

  abstract = {Here we show that separate modules fabricated using 3D printing technology can be easily assembled to quantitate the amount of nitric oxide released from endothelial cells following ATP stimulation.           ,                             Fabrication of microchip-based devices using 3D printing technology offers a unique platform to create separate modules that can be put together when desired for analysis. A 3D printed module approach offers various advantages such as file sharing and the ability to easily replace, customize, and modify the individual modules. Here, we describe the use of a modular approach to electrochemically detect the ATP-mediated release of nitric oxide (NO) from endothelial cells. Nitric oxide plays a significant role in the vasodilation process; however, detection of NO is challenging due to its short half-life. To enable this analysis, we use three distinct 3D printed modules: cell culture, sample injection and detection modules. The detection module follows a pillar-based wall-jet electrode design, where the analyte impinges normal to the electrode surface, offering enhanced sensitivity for the analyte. To further enhance the sensitivity and selectivity for NO detection the working electrode (100 μm gold) is modified by the addition of a 27 μm gold pillar and platinum-black coated with Nafion. The use of the pillar electrode leads to three-dimensional structure protruding into the channel enhancing the sensitivity by 12.4 times in comparison to the flat electrode (resulting LOD for NO = 210 nM). The next module, the 3D printed sample injection module, follows a simple 4-port injection rotor design made of two separate components that when assembled can introduce a specific volume of analyte. This module not only serves as a cheaper alternative to the commercially available 4-port injection valves, but also demonstrates the ability of volume customization and reduced dead-volume issues with the use of capillary-free connections. Comparison between the 3D printed and a commercial 4-port injection valve showed similar sensitivities and reproducibility for NO analysis. Lastly, the cell culture module contains electrospun polystyrene fibers with immobilized endothelial cells, resulting in 3D scaffold for cell culture. With the incorporation of all 3 modules, we can make reproducible ATP injections (               via               the 3-D printed sample injection module) that can stimulate NO release from endothelial cells cultured on a fibrous insert in the cell culture module which can then be quantitated by the pillar WJE module (0.19 ± 0.03 nM per cell,               n               = 27, 3 inserts analyzed each day, on 9 different days). The modular approach demonstrates the facile creation of custom and modifiable fluidic components that can be assembled as needed.},

  abstract = {Rising trend of solid waste production particularly in town and city areas has caused numerous environmental pollutions. Population growth, economic and lifestyle patterns are the factors that lead to the alarming rate of solid waste production. Landfilling is widely used for disposal of wastes due to its low operation and maintenance costs. However, leachate discharged from landfill could be a problem to surface and groundwater if it is not adequately treated. So, the investigation of the transportation and transformation phenomena of micro pollutants along the river receiving discharge from landfill leachate is mandatory. This study is carried out to investigate the water quality as well as to detect the presence of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) along Kinta river in Peninsular Malaysia. Water quality parameters i.e. biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, ammoniacal nitrogen, total suspended solids, dissolved oxygen and pH were recorded to calculate the water quality index (WQI). The identification of EDCs was carried out using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis. Water quality index result showed that the status of the river in both months fall under good and medium status where it requires intensive/conventional treatment for consumable and drinking purposes. None of the EDCs was detected in any of the samples analysed in the present study. It is believed that the information gained are useful and beneficial for decision making authority.},

  abstract = {The microfluidics field is at a critical crossroads. The vast majority of microfluidic devices are presently manufactured using micromolding processes that work very well for a reduced set of biocompatible materials, but the time, cost, and design constraints of micromolding hinder the commercialization of many devices. As a result, the dissemination of microfluidic technology—and its impact on society—is in jeopardy. Digital manufacturing (DM) refers to a family of computer-centered processes that integrate digital three-dimensional (3D) designs, automated (additive or subtractive) fabrication, and device testing in order to increase fabrication efficiency. Importantly, DM enables the inexpensive realization of 3D designs that are impossible or very difficult to mold. The adoption of DM by microfluidic engineers has been slow, likely due to concerns over the resolution of the printers and the biocompatibility of the resins. In this article, we review and discuss the various printer types, resolution, biocompatibility issues, DM microfluidic designs, and the bright future ahead for this promising, fertile field.},

First, a practical droplet speed measurement method has been methodically demonstrated and some related velocity terms have been introduced. Next, influence of electrode shape on droplet speed has been studied and a new design to enhance droplet speed has been proposed and experimentally demonstrated. Instead of using square shaped electrodes, rectangular electrodes with smaller widths are used to actuate droplets. Additionally, different schemes of activating electrodes are studied and compared for the same applied voltage. The experiments show that a particular scheme of activating the array of rectangular electrodes enhances the droplet speed up to 100\% in comparison to the droplet speed in a conventional device with square shaped electrodes.},

The Movement Control Order (MCO) in Malaysia acts to moderate the spread of COVID-19 through the enacted measures. Furthermore, massive industrial, agricultural activities and human encroachment were significantly reduced following the MCO guidelines. In this study, first, a reconnaissance survey was carried out on the effects of MCO on the health conditions of two urban rivers (i.e., Rivers of Klang and Penang) in Malaysia. Secondly, the effect of MCO lockdown on the water quality index (WQI) of a lake (Putrajaya Lake) in Malaysia is considered in this study. Finally, four machine learning algorithms have been investigated to predict WQI and the class in Putrajaya Lake. The main observations based on the analysis showed that noticeable enhancements of varying degrees in the WQI had occurred in the two investigated rivers. With regard to Putrajaya Lake, there is a significant increase in the WQI Class I, from 24\% in February 2020 to 94\% during the MCO month of March 2020. For WQI prediction, Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) outperformed other models in predicting the changes in the index with a high level of accuracy. For sensitivity analysis results, it is shown that NH3-N and COD play vital rule and contributing significantly to predicting the class of WQI, followed by BOD, while the remaining three parameters (i.e. pH, DO, and TSS) exhibit a low level of importance.},

  abstract = {In this work, a digital microfluidic system for droplet handling using ElectroWetting-On-Dielectrics (EWOD) technique in closed configuration based on Printed Circuit Board (PCB) technology is presented. The proposed system features a bidimensional 24x24-electrodes array controlled by seven control signals that allow to move a droplet along the entire array. A stack of a dielectric layer (SU-8) and a hydrophobic layer (Teflon AF1600) deposited on the PCB complete the EWOD device. Technological processes have been refined and adapted in order to be compatible with the PCB substrate material while ensuring good adhesion as well satisfactory dielectric characteristics. Experimental results of contact angle measurements as a function of the applied voltage are in good agreement with the LippmannYoung equation. The system has been tested in “closed” EWOD configuration by dispensing 1 µL of water and by driving the fluid over the array applying voltages in the range 15 V to 30 V to the control electrodes.},

  abstract = {The Skudai River has experienced a general decline in water quality over the last several years due to agricultural practices, economic development, and other human activities in the river catchment. The spatial trend of water quality index (WQI) and its sub-indexes are important for determining the locations of major pollutant sources that contribute to water quality depletion in the Skudai and its tributaries. In this study, we have developed WQI for eight sections of the Skudai watershed. Ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) was identified as a major pollutant downstream from the Skudai, with the lowest WQI index (i.e. 38). WQI for the Skudai (natural) was 94, i.e., Class I (very clean) category of river water quality. The Senai River has WQI value of 85 and Class II category (slightly polluted). However, the Kempas River, which was in suburban parts of the Skudai watershed, had WQI of 53 (Class III, polluted). The Melana and Danga rivers were also polluted rivers with WQI of 69 and 57, respectively, in Class III (polluted). Overall water quality in the Skudai and its tributaries was downstream of the river. The study also assessed water quality of the Skudai and its tributaries from other water quality parameters such as conductivity, turbidity, temperature, total dissolved solids, total phosphorous, and nitrogen, which were not part of the WQI formula developed by the Department of the Environment (DOE), Malaysia. The study found that Department of Education (DOE) formula for WQI was not effective in water quality assessment as many important parameters such as nutrients, heavy metals, and fecal coliform (or E. Coli) were missing in the WQI formula.},

  abstract = {Rivers were places where civilizations arose and aided the foundations of their economic fortunes. However, most urban rivers have today been abused and undervalued, and thus little conserved or re-opened up to celebrate these waterways. Malaysia is one of a number of countries whom have witnessed the former. In 2011, the River of Life (RoL) Entry Points Projects (EPP) was introduced to address this issue aimed towards revitalizing the Klang River into a heritage riverscape and a reinvigorated linear commercial centre for Greater Kuala Lumpur and the Klang Valley (GKL/KV). This paper discusses the heritage fabric at the confluence of the Klang and Gombak Rivers in portraying and narrating the importance of these rivers to the cultural identity of this precinct. Recognising these qualities will result in highlighting the cultural heritage values that need to be considered in recognizing this riverscape as a National Heritage asset. This paper also explored the historical and potential elements of the urban river in Malaysia through the mix method approach (Convergent Parallel). Research data was obtained from Malaysian authorities, using a top-down approach, through interview and visitor participant questionnaires to obtain convergence and divergence perceptions and patterns between these two sources of data. Data obtained sought to elucidate the cultural identity of this urban riverscape and its fabric from the perspective of both official participants perceived responsibilities and the interpretation of the riverscape from local respondent perspectives. The results of data from both participant types is crucial in offering new viewpoints towards a new to better adapt the government’s visions and visitor expectation about the future of this riverscape. This information could better enhance the tourism aspects of this area that has been highlighted as ‘National Key Economic Area (NKEA) 06: Tourism’, and to foster the integration of cultural heritage in an urban setting.},

  abstract = {Over the past-decade, agricultural products (such as vegetables and fruits) have been reported as the major vehicles for foodborne diseases, which are limiting food resources. The spread of infectious diseases due to foodborne pathogens poses a global threat to human health and the economy. The accurate and timely detection of infectious disease and of causative pathogens is crucial in the prevention and treatment of disease. Negligence in the detection of pathogenic substances can be catastrophic and lead to a pandemic. Despite the revolution in health diagnostics, much attention has been paid to the agro-food sector regarding the detection of food contaminants (such as pathogens). The conventional analytical techniques for pathogen detection are reliable and still in operation. However, laborious procedures and time-consuming detection via these approaches emphasize the need for simple, easy-to-use, and affordable detection techniques. The rapid detection of pathogens from food is essential to avoid the morbidity and mortality originating from the suboptimal nature of empiric pathogen treatment. This review critically discusses both the conventional and emerging bio-molecular approaches for pathogen detection in agro-food.},

In order to streamline these processes, the fluid handling technique digital microfluidics (DMF) has provided a miniaturized platform to perform various steps of bacterial protocols from sample preparation to analysis. DMF devices can be paired/interfaced with instrumentation such as microscopes, plate readers, and incubators, demonstrating their versatility with existing research tools. Alternatively, DMF instruments can be integrated into all-in-one packages with on-chip magnetic separation for sample preparation, heating/cooling modules to perform assay steps and cameras for absorbance and/or fluorescence measurements. This perspective outlines the beneficial features DMF offers to bacterial protocols, highlights limitations of current work and proposes future directions for this tool’s expansion in the field.},

  abstract = {The rapid development resulted in the deterioration of the quality of drinking water in Malaysia. Recognizing the importance of water quality, new alternatives for drinking water such as mineral water processing from reverse osmosis (RO) machine become more popular. Hence, the demand for mineral water, natural spring water or water from the hills or mountains rose lately. More consumers believed the quality of these spring water better than other source of drinking water. However, the quality of all the drinking water sources is to meet the required quality standard. Therefore, this paper aims to measure the quality of the waters from hills, from RO machine and the water supply in Ulu Yam, Selangor Batang Kali, Malaysia. The water quality was determined based on following parameters: ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3), iron (Fe), turbidity (NTU) and pH. The results show that the water from hills has better quality compared to water supply and water from RO machine. The value of NH3 ranged from 0.03 mg/L- 0.67 mg/L; Fe was from 0.03mg/L – 0.12 mg/L, turbidity at 0.42 NTU –0.88 NTU and pH is at 6.60 – 0.71. Based on the studied parameters, all three types of water are fit for drinking and have met the required national drinking water quality standard.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new format for particle-based immunoassays relying on digital microfluidics (DMF) and magnetic forces to separate and resuspend antibody-coated paramagnetic particles. In DMF, fluids are electrostatically controlled as discrete droplets (picoliters to microliters) on an array of insulated electrodes. By applying appropriate sequences of potentials to these electrodes, multiple droplets can be manipulated simultaneously and various droplet operations can be achieved using the same device design. This flexibility makes DMF well-suited for applications that require complex, multistep protocols such as immunoassays. Here, we report the first particle-based immunoassay on DMF without the aid of oil carrier fluid to enable droplet movement (i.e., droplets are surrounded by air instead of oil). This new format allowed the realization of a novel on-chip particle separation and resuspension method capable of removing greater than 90\% of unbound reagents in one step. Using this technique, we developed methods for noncompetitive and competitive immunoassays, using thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and 17β-estradiol (E2) as model analytes, respectively. We show that, compared to conventional methods, the new DMF approach reported here reduced reagent volumes and analysis time by 100fold and 10-fold, respectively, while retaining a level of analytical performance required for clinical screening. Thus, we propose that the new technique has great potential for eventual use in a fast, low-waste, and inexpensive instrument for the quantitative analysis of proteins and small molecules in low sample volumes.},

  abstract = {Milk is a necessity for human life. However, it is susceptible to contamination and adulteration. Microfluidic analysis devices have attracted significant attention for the high-throughput quality inspection and contaminant analysis of milk samples in recent years. This review describes the major proposals presented in the literature for the pretreatment, contaminant detection, and quality inspection of milk samples using microfluidic lab-on-a-chip and lab-on-paper platforms in the past five years. The review focuses on the sample separation, sample extraction, and sample preconcentration/amplification steps of the pretreatment process and the determination of aflatoxins, antibiotics, drugs, melamine, and foodborne pathogens in the detection process. Recent proposals for the general quality inspection of milk samples, including the viscosity and presence of adulteration, are also discussed. The review concludes with a brief perspective on the challenges facing the future development of microfluidic devices for the analysis of milk samples in the coming years.},

  abstract = {The interdisciplinary research field of microfluidics has the potential to revolutionize current technologies that require the handling of a small amount of fluid, a fast response, low costs and automation. Microfluidic platforms that handle small amounts of liquid have been categorised as continuous-flow microfluidics and digital microfluidics. The first part of this paper discusses the recent advances of the two main and opposing applications of liquid handling in continuous-flow microfluidics: mixing and separation. Mixing and separation are essential steps in most lab-on-a-chip platforms, as sample preparation and detection are required for a variety of biological and chemical assays. The second part discusses the various digital microfluidic strategies, based on droplets and liquid marbles, for the manipulation of discrete microdroplets. More advanced digital microfluidic devices combining electrowetting with other techniques are also introduced. The applications of the emerging field of liquid-marble-based digital microfluidics are also highlighted. Finally, future perspectives on microfluidic liquid handling are discussed.},

  abstract = {This paper reports the results of theoretical and experimental investigations of reciprocating thermocapillary motion of a liquid plug in microchannels. A one-dimensional analytical model for the transport of micro plugs in a capillary was established. The model consists of a system of two transient one-dimensional equations: one for temperature spreading in the capillary wall and one for the dynamics of surface tension driven movement of the plug. Surface tension depends strongly on temperature. Thus, a transient temperature distribution leads to a gradient of surface stress across a liquid plug. This surface stress difference leads to the movement of the liquid plug. For the experimental investigation two heaters were used for the periodic temperature gradient. Each of the heaters was activated alternatively to induce the reciprocating motion of the liquid plug. For quantitative evaluation, the position of the plugs was captured and evaluated with a CCD camera. This paper focuses on analysing the results of this motion at different switching frequencies. The results show that the motion of the plug exhibits a chaotic characteristics at high switching frequencies. This actuation concept has potential applications in post-processing stages for droplet-based microfluidics. The chaotic motion can be explored for efficient mixing in microplugs.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting technique is an actuation method for manipulating position and velocity of fluids in the microchannels. By combining electrowetting technique and a freestanding mode triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), we have designed a self-powered micro-fluidic transport system. In this system, a mini vehicle is fabricated by using four droplets to carry a pallet (6 mm × 8 mm) and it can transport some tiny object on the track electrodes under the drive of TENG. The motion of TENG can provide both driving power and control signal for the mini vehicle. The maximum load for this mini vehicle is 500 mg and its highest controllable velocity can reach 1 m/s. Freestanding TENG has shown excellent capability to manipulate microfluid. Under the drive of TENG, the minimum volume of the droplet can reach 70\textasciitilde 80 nL, while the tiny droplet can freely move on both horizontal and vertical planes. Finally, another strategy for delivering nanoparticles to the designated position has also been demonstrated. This proposed self-powered transport technique may have great applications in the field of micro solid/liquid manipulator, drug delivery system, micro robotics and human-machine interaction.},

These capabilities are sought in applications that need tiny but accurate volume of liquid delivery at high flow rate. For this purpose, we mainly focused on geometry of electrodes and developed novel shapes and arrangements of electrodes in electrowetting on dielectric microfluidic device. To dispense liquid droplets in higher volume precision and consistency, a novel reservoir design named TCC reservoir is introduced. To reduce time to dispense a droplet, L-junction is developed. Y-junction is designed to split a droplet into two at the same speed as droplet dispensing speed by the L-junction, and hence increase the number of droplets arrive to the target area (i.e. at high frequency delivery).},

Industry discharges and fertilizer run-off release ammonia into sewers and streams, overloading wastewater treatment plants and causing fish deaths in surface water such as rivers, sea and lakes. The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of the microfluidic paper-based device (µPAD) for the quantification of ammonia in wastewater. The µPAD fabricated had an oval-shaped pattern which was designed using CorelDraw software. The hydrophilic zones were created by printing a chromatographic paper with a Xerox wax printer (Xerox colorqube 8570). The modified version of the colorimetric method using Nessler reagent was combined with microfluidic technologies to create a low-cost monitoring system for detection of ammonia in wastewater. The method allows for ammonia determination in the range of 0–5 ppm (mg/L) with a limit of detection of 3.34 ppm. This study indicated that a µPAD was successfully used to quantify the concentration of ammonia in wastewater.},

The water quality status of rivers was classified based on the Interim National Water Quality Standard (INWQS) for Malaysia. The six water quality parameters used to determine the water quality index are dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solid (TSS), ammonia and pH value. Based on the WQI assessment, among the 11 rivers studied, none of the rivers were considered as clean. The upstream and middle stream of the Pinang River in Balik Pulau (with WQI = 69 and 70 respectively), the upstream and middle stream of the Kongsi River (with WQI = 67 and 72 respectively) and the upstream of the Betong River (with WQI = 63) were slightly polluted, while the rest of the rivers had a WQI of below 60, which were categorized as polluted rivers. Among the 30 sampling stations, 17 stations were classified as Class III (extensive treatment of water supply required; fish for common economic value, species tolerance, and for livestock drinking), and 13 stations were classified as Class IV water status, which was classified as irrigation according to INWQS. From this study, the WQI and river classification system were considered as a tool for assessing the health status of river water quality. Efficient and sustainable management of rivers in Penang Island should be emphasized in order to protect their aesthetic value for future generations.},

  abstract = {We have fabricated a silicon-glass two-phase droplet microfluidic system capable of generating sub 100 µm-sized, ⌀ = (74 ± 2) µm, spherical droplets at rates of up to hundreds of hertz. By implementing a two-dimensional (2D) acoustophoresis particle-positioning method, we show a fourfold improvement in both vertical and lateral particle positioning inside the droplets compared to unactuated operation. The efficiency of the system has been optimized by incorporating aluminum matching layers in the transducer design permitting biocompatible operational temperatures ({$<$}37 °C). Furthermore, by using acoustic actuation, (99.8 ± 0.4)\% of all encapsulated microparticles can be detected compared to only (79.0 ± 5.1)\% for unactuated operation. In our experiments we observed a strong ordering of the microparticles in distinct patterns within the droplet when using 2D acoustophoresis; to explain the origin of these patterns we simulated numerically the fluid flow inside the droplets and compared with the experimental findings.},

  abstract = {This study presents energy-efficient solutions for wireless sensor systems intended for the monitoring of water quality at water stations. Energy problems, such as energy scarcity and energy consumption in wireless sensor networks, are critical issues that raise concerns when it comes to defining the lifetime of a network. This can be attributed to the finite energy budget of water quality sensor nodes and also the lack of energy-efficient schemes. To address these energy problems, a detailed study has been carried out in this paper on some of the major approaches developed to address energy issues in wireless sensor systems, and dedicated to the monitoring of water quality applications in a way that contextualizes the considered solution methods. Furthermore, the solution methods are classified, while their strengths and weaknesses are also identified. Also, several suggestions are made on solution methods towards further improvement. Therefore, this study suggests a reasonable direction for future studies on developing energy-efficient solutions in wireless sensor systems for monitoring water quality applications.},

  abstract = {With the transition of fluid-capillary-based “Lab on a chip 1.0″ concepts in analytical chemistry to “Lab on a chip 2.0″ approaches relying on distinct fluid droplets (“digital microfluidics”, DMF), the need for reliable methods for droplet actuation has increasingly come into focus. One possible approach is based on “electrowetting on dielectric” (EWOD). This technique has the disadvantage that any possible desired later positions of the droplets on the chip have to be defined prior to chip realization because one of the EWOD electrode layers has to be structured accordingly. “Optoelectrowetting” (OEW) goes a step further in the sense that the later droplet positions do not have to be known before, and none of the electrode layers has to be structured. Instead, the electrical parameters of the layer sequence can be altered locally by an impinging (and movable) light spot. Although some research groups have succeeded in demonstrating OEW actuation of droplets, the optimization of the relevant parameters of the layer sequence and the droplet – at least half a dozen parameters altogether – is tedious and not straight-forward. In this contribution, for optimization purposes, the equations governing OEW are revisited and altered again, e.g., by numerical implementation of the experimentally well-known saturation of the contact angle change. Additionally, a Nelder-Mead algorithm is applied to find the parameters, on which the optimization has to focus to maximize contact angle changes and, thus, mechanical forces on the droplets. The numerical investigation yields diverse results, e.g., the finding that the droplet’s contact area on the dielectric layer has a strong influence on the contact angle change and the question whether the droplet is pulled or pushed. Moreover, the interplay between frequency and amplitude of the applied rectangular alternate voltage is important for optimization.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Culture‐expanded mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are promising candidates for clinical cell‐based therapies. MSC products are heterogeneous and we therefore investigated whether acoustophoresis, an ultrasound‐based separation technology, could be used for the label‐free enrichment of functionally different MSC populations. Acoustophoresis uses an ultrasonic standing wave field in a microchannel that differentially affects the movement of cells depending on their acoustophysical properties, such as size, density, and compressibility. Human bone marrow (BM) MSCs were generated by standard adherent culture in xeno‐free medium and separated by microchip acoustophoresis. MSCs with up to 20\% higher proliferation and 1.7‐fold increased clonogenic potential were enriched in the side outlet of the chip compared to the input sample. These cells were significantly smaller (average diameter 14.5\,±\,0.4~μm) compared to the center outlet fraction (average diameter 17.1\,±\,0.6~μm) and expressed higher levels of genes related to proliferation and stem cell properties (               i.e               .,               Ki‐67               [1.9‐fold],               Nanog1               [6.65‐fold],               Oct4               [2.9‐fold], and               CXCL12               [1.8‐fold],               n               ~=~3) in the side outlet compared to input. Fractions of MSCs in G               0               /G               1               cell cycle phase were significantly enriched in the side fraction and an up to 2.8‐fold increase of cells in S/G               2               /M phases were observed in center fractions compared to side fractions and 1.3‐fold increased compared to the input sample. Acoustophoresis did not compromise MSC phenotype, proliferation, clonogenic capacity, and viability (generally 87–98\%), nor did it affect differentiation or immunomodulatory capacities. These results demonstrate that label‐free acoustic separation can enrich functionally different MSC subsets which can potentially be employed to produce better‐defined stromal cell products from cultured MSCs. Hence, acoustophoresis is a potentially promising separation technology to provide improved cell products for research and possible future clinical use. © 2020 The Authors.

This perspective covers solutions to embed sustainability at the R\&D and product development stages.           ,                             Single-use, disposable, point-of-care diagnostic devices carry great promise for global health, including meeting urgent needs for testing and diagnosis in places with limited laboratory facilities. Unfortunately, the production and disposal of single-use devices, whether in lateral flow assay, cartridges, cassettes, or lab-on-chip microfluidic format, also poses significant challenges for environmental and human health. Point-of-care devices are commonly manufactured from unsustainable polymeric materials derived from fossil sources. Their disposal often necessitates incineration to reduce infection risk, thereby creating additional release of CO               2               . Many devices also contain toxic chemicals, such as cyanide derivatives, that are damaging to environmental and human health if not disposed of safely. Yet, in the absence of government regulatory frameworks, safe and sustainable waste management for these novel medical devices is often left unaddressed. There is an urgent need to find novel solutions to avert environmental and human harm from these devices, especially in low- and middle-income countries where waste management infrastructure is often weak and where the use of point-of-care tests is projected to rise in coming years. We review here common materials used in the manufacture of single-use point-of-care diagnostic tests, examine the risks they pose to environmental and human health, and investigate replacement materials that can potentially reduce the impact of microfluidic devices on the production of harmful waste. We propose solutions available to point-of-care test developers to start embedding sustainability at an early stage in their design, and to reduce their non-renewable plastic consumption in research and product development.},

In addition, influence of a test sample over the designed sensor for varying lift-off distances from the top of the sensor surface and for various material permittivity values are investigated. Results of the studies show that a spiral structure has about 25\% higher sensitivity for its capacitance value compared to a corresponding Rectangular Inter-Digital Capacitive (RIDC) structure of comparable dimensions. The simulation results have been verified experimentally by fabricating and testing SIDC and RIDC structures for dielectric characterization of materials and proximity measurement applications.

  abstract = {Salmonellosis is the second most commonly reported foodborne gastrointestinal infection in humans in the European Union (EU). Most outbreaks are caused by Salmonella Enteritidis, present in contaminated food products, particularly in egg and egg products. In recent years, an increase in the prevalence of Salmonella in laying hen flocks in the EU has been observed. For the effective control of infection, adequate detection is key. In laying hen flocks, the occurrence of Salmonella in the EU is monitored by the culture of environmental samples (dust, faeces, and boot swabs). The performance of sampling procedures described in the literature for the detection of Salmonella in laying hens was reviewed. In total, 924 abstracts were screened, resulting in the selection of 87 abstracts and 18 publications for qualitative and quantitative analyses, respectively. Sample sizes and sampling locations of faecal material and dust were variable and poorly described. Microbiological culture methods used to detect Salmonella were variably described in the literature and were often incomplete. Overall, the available literature indicates higher sensitivity of environmental versus individual hen matrices and points to differences in sensitivity between environmental matrices. For non-cage housing systems, boot swabs are the preferred samples, while for cage housing systems dust might be a more reliable sample.},

The effect of water cross-sensitivity of a gas sensor was eliminated using a hydrophobic porous micro-channel, which provides selective detection of the aromas of a wine droplet manipulated on a DMF platform. Seven different kinds of wines are tested and successfully recognized. The temporal responses of the sensor to a droplet of each of these wines are reported. Two features are extracted from the transient response and mapped into a 2D plot to show the segregation of different wines.},

  abstract = {A droplet of an ionic liquid (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, bmim.BF4) is immersed in an immiscible liquid (n-hexadecane) and electrowetted on a flat Teflon AF1600-coated ITO electrode. The static contact angle decreases significantly when voltage is applied between the droplet and the electrode: from 145° down to 50° (with DC voltage) and 15° (with AC voltage). The electrowetting curves (contact angle versus voltage) are similar to the ones obtained in other solid/liquid/vapor and solid/liquid/ liquid systems: symmetric with respect to zero voltage and correctly described by Young-Lippmann equation below saturation. The reversibility is excellent and contact angle hysteresis is minimal (∼2°). The step size used in applying the DC voltage and the polarity of the voltage are unimportant. The saturation contact angle cannot be predicted with the simple zero-interfacial tension theory. Spreading (after applying a DC voltage) and retraction (after switching off the voltage) of the droplet is monitored. The base area of the droplet varies exponentially during wetting (exponential saturation) and dewetting (exponential decay). The characteristic time is 20 ms for spreading and 35 ms for retraction (such asymmetry is not observed with water-glycerol mixtures of a similar viscosity). The spreading kinetics (dynamic contact angle versus contact line speed) can be described by the hydrodynamic model (Voinov’s equation) for small contact angles and by the molecular-kinetic model (Blake’s equation) for large contact angles. The role of viscous and molecular dissipation follows the scheme outlined by Brochard-Wyart and de Gennes.},

These chips are also known as digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs). In this work, initially we have presented a study on the effect of external actuation voltage in various parameters like transport velocity and contact angles during droplet movement on DMFB, in the realm of surface hysteresis. Next, a greedy heuristic method is adopted in conjunction with droplet velocity lookup under varying range of voltage actuation to perform improved droplet routing on digital microfluidic biochips. Here a specified routing time, termed as latest arrival time (LAT) is calculated in an ideal case, without considering practical electrowetting effects. Then a stepwise voltage increment is performed through the droplet routing paths to reach the specified target location in time. Goal of the proposed method is to achieve a specified routing time for all the droplets towards their destinations. Experimental analysis ascertains the suitability of this technique in enhancing the throughput of an LOC in terms of transport time reduction, and elimination of any failed net during routing.},

Electrowetting is the change in contact angle of a liquid relative to its equilibrium value upon application of a potential bias. The phenomenon, being identified almost a century ago, is fundamentally an electrochemical process. However, the majority of the most recent research in this area focuses on electrowetting from the “applications” perspective. Device-based electrowetting uses substrates with insulating overlayers to eliminate charge transfer at the solid|liquid interface and hence suppress the electrochemical character of the overall process. In this short review, we focus on electrowetting directly on conductors and discuss the purely electrochemical aspects of the phenomenon along with the open questions related to this rejuvenated topic.},

The conventional laboratory‐based diagnostics of microbes such as bacteria and viruses need bulky expensive experimental instruments and skilled personnel which limits their usage in resource‐limited settings. The biosensors‐based point‐of‐care (POC) diagnostics have shown huge potential to detect microbial pathogens in a faster, cost‐effective, and user‐friendly manner. The use of various transducers such as electrochemical and optical along with microfluidic integrated biosensors further enhances the sensitivity and selectivity of detection. Additionally, microfluidic‐based biosensors offer the advantages of multiplexed detection of analyte and the ability to deal with nanoliters volume of fluid in an integrated portable platform. In the present review, we discussed the design and fabrication of POCT devices for the detection of microbial pathogens which include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. The electrochemical techniques and current advances in this field in terms of integrated electrochemical platforms that include mainly microfluidic‐ based approaches and smartphone and Internet‐of‐things (IoT) and Internet‐of‐Medical‐Things (IoMT) integrated systems have been highlighted. Further, the availability of commercial biosensors for the detection of microbial pathogens will be briefed. In the end, the challenges while fabrication of POC biosensors and expected future advances in the field of biosensing have been discussed. The integrated biosensor‐based platforms with the IoT/IoMT usually collect the data to track the community spread of infectious diseases which would be beneficial in terms of better preparedness for current and futuristic pandemics and is expected to prevent social and economic losses.},

We investigated the fundamental features of droplet transport for the single-plate configuration. We compared the performance of several switching methods with respect to maximum speed of successive transport without failure and suggested nonfloating switching method which is inherently free from the charge-residue problem and exerts greater force on a droplet than conventional switching methods.

In this review, we introduce an overview of user-friendly microfluidic devices for practical sample preparation in POCT, including self- and hand-operated microfluidic devices. Self-operated microfluidic devices exploit capillary force, vacuum-driven pressure, or gas-generating chemical reactions to apply pressure into microchannels, and hand-operated microfluidic devices utilize human power sources using simple equipment, including a syringe, pipette, or simply by using finger actuation. Furthermore, this review provides future perspectives to realize user-friendly integrated microfluidic circuits for wider applications with the integration of simple microfluidic valves.},

Due to their large area, collection, analysis, and management of a large amount of water quality data are essential. Water quality data are collected mainly by manual field sampling, and recently real-time sensor monitoring has been increasingly applied for efficient data collection. However, real-time sensor monitoring still relies on only a few parameters, such as water level, velocity, temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH. Although advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral images (HSI), have been used for the areal monitoring of algal bloom, other water quality sensors for organic compounds, phosphorus (P), and nitrogen (N) still need to be further developed and improved for field applications. The utilization of information and communications technology (ICT) with sensor technology shows great potential for the monitoring, transmission, and management of field water-quality data and thus for developing effective water quality management. This paper presents a review of the recent advances in ICT and field applicable sensor technology for monitoring water quality, mainly focusing on water resources, such as rivers and lakes, and discusses the challenges and future directions.},

  abstract = {Recent advancements in Electrowetting on Dielectric (EWOD) systems, such as simplified fabrication, low-voltage actuation, and the development of more reliable materials, are expanding the potential applications of electrowetting actuators. One application of EWOD actuators is in RF devices to enable dynamic reconfiguration and allow real-time adjustments to frequency and bandwidth. In this paper, a method is introduced to actuate a panel using EWOD forces. In the EWOD system, the velocity of the plate increases by maximizing the actuation force, minimizing the moving mass (droplets and metalized plate), and reducing resistance (contact line drag, fluid drag). However, some of these are competing factors. For instance, the actuation force can be increased by increasing the number of droplets, but this also increases the inertia and the drag force. An analytical model of EWOD actuation is presented to understand system performance tradeoffs. The model is validated with an EWOD experiment, and the data demonstrate less than a 7.8\% error between the measured and predicted maximum plate velocities for different voltage inputs. In addition, this study presents a 3D numerical FEM model to analyze the velocity profile and viscous force in the thin droplets, focusing on variations along the droplet’s height, which cannot be captured experimentally. The main advantage of the proposed system over previous works is the simple 2D manufacturing process, which allows embedding metalized plates and RF circuit boards, in addition to being compact, portable, and low-cost. In addition, the proposed method does not have any mechanical components, which can increase the system’s reliability in a harsh environment.},

  abstract = {A concept of a nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membrane as a vibro-active micro/nano-filter in a micro hydro mechanical system for the filtration, separation, and manipulation of bioparticles is reported in this paper. For the fabrication of a nanoporous AAO, a two-step mild anodization (MA) and hard anodization (HA) technique was used. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to analyze the surface morphology of nanoporous AAO. A nanoporous structure with a pore diameter in the range of 50–90 nm, an interpore distance of 110 nm, and an oxide layer thickness of 0.12 mm with 60.72\% porosity was obtained. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were employed to evaluate AAO chemical properties. The obtained results showed that the AAO structure is of hexagonal symmetry and showed where Al2O3 is dominant. The hydrophobic properties of the nanoporous surface were characterized by water contact angle measurement. It was observed that the surface of the nanoporous AAO membrane is hydrophilic. Furthermore, to determine whether a nanomembrane could function as a vibro-active nano filter, a numerical simulation was performed using COMSOL Multiphysics 5.4 (COMSOL Inc, Stockholm, Sweden). Here, a membrane was excited at a frequency range of 0–100 kHz for surface acoustics wave (SAW) distribution on the surface of the nanoporous AAO using a PZT 5H cylinder (Piezo Hannas, Wuhan, China). The SAW, standing acoustic waves, and travelling acoustic waves of different wavelengths were excited to the fabricated AAO membrane and the results were compared with experimental ones, obtained from non-destructive testing method 3D scanning vibrometer (PSV-500-3D-HV, Polytec GmbH, Waldbronn, Germany) and holographic interferometry system (PRISM, Hy-Tech Forming Systems (USA), Phoenix, AZ, USA). Finally, a simulation of a single nanotube was performed to analyze the acoustic pressure distribution and time, needed to center nanoparticles in the nanotube.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) can identify substantial interactions by considering the datasets in the emerging era of technologies. It is widely applied in various applications, and healthcare is among them. AI plays a vital role in clinical applications in predicting the disease type, treating the disease, managing chronic situations, and diagnosing the same. AI has simplified the lives of doctors, patients, and administrators at hospitals in the healthcare environment by operating various tasks with lesser computation time and accurate results. The unique challenges such as AI's availability, accessibility, and affordability have contributed to the success of healthcare applications. Another factor that enhances the functionality of AI is based on the sourced medical data, which is analyzed, and a model is built to predict the disease by the application of Machine Learning (ML). The other reason for the successful application of AI in the healthcare environment is Computational Intelligence (CI), which is an analysis, design, theory, and development of linguistically and biologically motivated computational techniques. The functionality of CI is identified on the three pillars Fuzzy Systems, Neural Networks, and Evolutionary Computation. This research mainly discusses AI's various applications in the current healthcare environment.

Microfluidic chip includes a set of groves or microchannels that are engraved on different materials (glass, silicon, or polymers such as polydimethylsiloxane or PDMS, polymethylmethacrylate or PMMA). The microchannels forming the microfluidic chip are interconnected with each other for desired results. This organization of microchannels trapped into the microfluidic chip is associated with the outside by inputs and outputs penetrating through the chip, as an interface between the macro- and miniature world. With the help of a pump and a chip, microfluidic chip helps to determine the behavioral change of the microfluids. Inside the chip, there are microfluidic channels that permit the processing of the fluid, for example, blending and physicochemical responses. Microfluidic chip has numerous points of interest including lesser time and reagent utilization and alongside this, it can execute numerous activities simultaneously. The miniatured size of the chip fastens the reaction as the surface area increases. It is utilized in different biomedical applications such as food safety sensing, peptide analysis, tissue engineering, medical diagnosis, DNA purification, PCR activity, pregnancy, and glucose estimation.

  abstract = {Zinc imidazole framework-8, abbreviated as ZIF-8, is a member of the metal organic framework (MOF) family. The chemical architecture of ZIF-8 consists of zinc metal duly coordinated with an organic ligand/fragment, resulting in a cagelike three-dimensional network with unique porosity. Because of such a unique architecture and physicochemical property, ZIF-8 has recently been explored in various applications such as gas storage, catalysis, electrochemical sensing, drug delivery, etc. Electrochemical sensors are currently a hot topic in scientific advances, where small, portable, Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled devices powered by electrochemical output show a newer path toward chemo and biosensor applications. The unique electrochemical property of ZIF-8 is hence explored widely for possible electrochemical sensor applications. The application and synthesis of the bare ZIF-8 have been widely reported for more than a decade. However, new scientific advancements depict tailoring the bare ZIF-8 structure to achieve smart hybrid ZIF-8 materials that show more advanced properties compared to bare ZIF-8. The framework is formed by joining inorganic (metal-containing) units with organic linkers by reticular synthesis, which results in the formation of a cross-linked crystalline network with permanent porosity. This unique porosity of ZIF-8 has recently been utilized for the encapsulation of suitable guest species to enhance the native physicochemical activity of ZIF-8. These engineered ZIF-8 materials show excellent results, especially for electrochemical sensing application. This review is intended to describe the research, including the one done by our group, where the ZIF-8 pore size is used for encapsulating nanoparticles, enzymes, and organic compounds to avail suitable sensor applications.},

The scarcity of water supply is becoming a concern due to the growing population of human along with environment pollutions. Rainwater harvesting is considered the most accessible source which could be easily used for potable purposes both for household and commercial activities. Therefore, in this study, the physical, microbiological and chemical rainwater quality samples were analyzed using membrane filtration technique (ELE Paqualab 50), ICP-OES and Hach methods, to ensure the suitability of rainwater harvesting for domestic consumption. The study reveals that overall quality of the rainwater is quite satisfactory as per WHO and Malaysian standards, where the pH, turbidity, total dissolved solids, salinity, NO3-, SO42-, Zn and Pb were still under the permissible limits. However, the microbiological parameters (total coliform, fecal coliform and E. coli) and chemical (Cr) were found exceeded the standards, due to poor hygienic practices of the harvesting system. It can be concluded that the rainwater harvesting is still safe to drink and can be a potential alternative source of water supply in the future.},

Here, we report an All-in-One digital microfluidic (DMF) pipeline for proteomic sample reduction, alkylation, digestion, isotopic labeling and analysis. The system features end-to-end automation, with integrated thermal control for digestion, optimized droplet additives for sample manipulation and analysis, and an automated interface to liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Dimethyl labeling was integrated into the pipeline to allow for relative quantification of the trace samples at the nanogram level, and the new pipeline was applied to evaluating cancer cell lines and cancer tissue samples. Several known proteins (including HSP90AB1, HSPB1, LDHA, ENO1, PGK1, KRT18, and AKR1C2) and pathways were observed between model breast cancer cell lines related to hormone response, cell metabolism, and cell morphology. Furthermore, differentially quantified proteins (such as PGS2, UGDH, ASPN, LUM, COEA1, and PRELP) were found in comparisons of healthy and cancer breast tissues, suggesting potential utility of the All-in-One pipeline for the emerging application of proteomic cancer sub-typing. In sum, the All-in-One pipeline represents a powerful new tool for automated proteome processing and analysis, with the potential to be useful for evaluating mass-limited samples for a wide range of applications.},

The electrodes are biased by converting mechanical energy into electrical energy using an array of piezoelectric elements.           ,                             We report a finger-powered digital microfluidic device based on the electrophoretic transport of discrete droplets (EPD). An array of piezoelectric elements is connected in parallel to metal electrodes immersed in dielectric fluids. When deflected in a controlled sequence               via               human finger power, the piezoelectric elements charge and actuate droplets across each electrode pair through electrophoretic force. Successful droplet transportation requires the piezoelectric elements to provide both sufficient charge and voltage pulse duration. We quantify these requirements using numerical models to predict the electrical charges induced on the droplets and the corresponding electrophoretic forces. The models are experimentally validated by comparing the predicted and measured droplet translational velocities. We successfully demonstrated transport and merging of aqueous droplets over a range of droplet radii (0.6–0.9 mm). We further showed direct manipulation of body fluids, including droplets of saliva and urine, using our finger-powered EPD device. To facilitate practical implementation of multistep assays based on the approach, a hand/finger-rotated drum system with a programmable pattern of protrusions is designed to induce deflections of multiple piezoelectric elements and demonstrate programmable fluidic functions. An electrode-to-piezoelectric element connection scheme to minimize the number of piezoelectric elements necessary for a sequence of microfluidic functions is also explored. The present work establishes an engineering foundation to enable design and implementation of finger-powered portable EPD microfluidic devices.},

The detection approach is based on the formation of cyanide from the hydrolysis of type-II pyrethroids and the colorimetric detection of cyanide on a layer-based µPAD. Parafilm and inexpensive laminating pouches were used to create a hydrophobic barrier for the assay on the µPAD. This detection approach was selective to type-II pyrethroids in water for which an environmental water sample was tested. The calibration curves for cypermethrin, deltamethrin, cyhalothrin, and fenvalerate ranged from 2 to 40 µg/mL without sample preconcentration. The lower concentrations of type-II pyrethroids can be assessed by including a preconcentration step prior to the detection on a µPAD. This detection system provides an alternative platform for fast, semiquantitative testing for pesticide contamination in environmental surface water by allowing for portability, low reagent/sample consumption, and low-cost testing.},

  abstract = {Lab-on-PCB devices have been developed for many biomedical and biochemical applications. However, much work has to be done towards commercial applications. Even so, the research on devices of this kind is rapidly increasing. The reason for this lies in the great potential of lab-on-PCB devices to provide marketable devices. This review describes the active flow driving methods for lab-on-PCB devices, while commenting on their main characteristics. Among others, the methods described are the typical external impulsion devices, that is, syringe or peristaltic pumps; pressurized microchambers for precise displacement of liquid samples; electrowetting on dielectrics; and electroosmotic and phase-change-based flow driving, to name a few. In general, there is not a perfect method because all of them have drawbacks. The main problems with regard to marketable devices are the complex fabrication processes, the integration of many materials, the sealing process, and the use of many facilities for the PCB-chips. The larger the numbers of integrated sensors and actuators in the PCB-chip, the more complex the fabrication. In addition, the flow driving-integrated devices increase that difficulty. Moreover, the biological applications are demanding. They require transparency, biocompatibility, and specific ambient conditions. All the problems have to be solved when trying to reach repetitiveness and reliability, for both the fabrication process and the working of the lab-on-PCB, including the flow driving system.},

In recent years, several laboratories have developed separation and manipulation techniques for cells and niicroorganisms based on dielectrophoresis, using both static and traveling AC fields.

  abstract = {A review is presented of the present status of the theory, the developed technology and the current applications of dielectrophoresis (DEP). Over the past 10 years around 2000 publications have addressed these three aspects, and current trends suggest that the theory and technology have matured sufficiently for most effort to now be directed towards applying DEP to unmet needs in such areas as biosensors, cell therapeutics, drug discovery, medical diagnostics, microfluidics, nanoassembly, and particle filtration. The dipole approximation to describe the DEP force acting on a particle subjected to a nonuniform electric field has evolved to include multipole contributions, the perturbing effects arising from interactions with other cells and boundary surfaces, and the influence of electrical double-layer polarizations that must be considered for nanoparticles. Theoretical modelling of the electric field gradients generated by different electrode designs has also reached an advanced state. Advances in the technology include the development of sophisticated electrode designs, along with the introduction of new materials (e.g., silicone polymers, dry film resist) and methods for fabricating the electrodes and microfluidics of DEP devices (photo and electron beam lithography, laser ablation, thin film techniques, CMOS technology). Around three-quarters of the 300 or so scientific publications now being published each year on DEP are directed towards practical applications, and this is matched with an increasing number of patent applications. A summary of the US patents granted since January 2005 is given, along with an outline of the small number of perceived industrial applications (e.g., mineral separation, micropolishing, manipulation and dispensing of fluid droplets, manipulation and assembly of micro components). The technology has also advanced sufficiently for DEP to be used as a tool to manipulate nanoparticles (e.g., carbon nanotubes, nano wires, gold and metal oxide nanoparticles) for the fabrication of devices and sensors. Most efforts are now being directed towards biomedical applications, such as the spatial manipulation and selective separation/enrichment of target cells or bacteria, high-throughput molecular screening, biosensors, immunoassays, and the artificial engineering of three-dimensional cell constructs. DEP is able to manipulate and sort cells without the need for biochemical labels or other bioengineered tags, and without contact to any surfaces. This opens up potentially important applications of DEP as a tool to address an unmet need in stem cell research and therapy.},

  date = {2013},
  abstract = {Seasonal variation study of physicochemical analysis in Bertam River, Cameron Highlands was carried out in August - November 2012. The river water quality was studied at six selected stations to represent different localities with varying anthropogenic discharge. Physicochemical parameters of the samples were measured pH, temperature, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, salinity, ammoniacal nitrogen, biochemical and chemical oxygen demand, suspended solids, nitrate and phosphate following standard methods. The mean values of the measured parameters were compared with Malaysian National Standard for Drinking Water Quality (NSDWQ) and Water Quality Index Department of Environment (DOE WQI). Present level concentration of ammoniacal nitrogen, biochemical and chemical oxygen demand were under the categorization of Class II and III while suspended solids were categorized in Class IV in wet season. Mean WQI for Bertam River in dry season (78 Class II) was slightly better than in wet season (74 Class III). Thus it was indicated at meteorological change such as rainfalls having significant negative influence on study site. Statistical analysis of one way ANOVA test indicates that all measured parameters are shown significant difference except for pH, DO, salinity, COD and ammoniacal nitrogen. In conclusion, present the water quality of Bertam River should be extensively monitored since deterioration of water quality was clearly observed. Therefore, some sort of integrated river water management and good practice agriculture scheme should be implemented.},

This problem involves multidisciplinary expertise combining research knowledge from various areas, including wet chemistry, biochemistry, physical chemistry, molecular biology, genetics, signal processing, microelectronics material science, and separation science. It has been documented that fairly primitive but fast and inexpensive screening methods involving paper-based analytical devices (PADs) and micro total analytical systems (μTAS) can be considered as serious alternatives to their more advanced counterparts such as GC, HPLC, and capillary electrophoresis coupled to various sophisticated detectors (e.g., multiwavelength spectrophotometers such as UV-Vis/DAD and mass spectrometers). The main advantage of PAD- and μTAS-driven technology is that such sensing devices may work under on-site and real-time conditions and measure a number of physical parameters and chemical factors simultaneously. Moreover, hybrid miniaturized analytical systems may combine sensing and data acquisition modules with common mobile phones and electronic devices working with global positioning systems and communicating through the Internet.},

This is partly due to an ongoing maturation and integration of existing methods, but possibly also because of the emergence of new techniques, whose potential has not been fully realized. This review summarizes the currently existing techniques for manipulating droplets in two-phase flow microfluidics. Specifically, very recent developments like the use of acoustic waves, magnetic fields, surface energy wells, and electrostatic traps and rails are discussed. The physical principles are explained, and (potential) advantages and drawbacks of different methods in the sense of versatility, flexibility, tunability and durability are discussed, where possible, per technique and per droplet operation: generation, transport, sorting, coalescence and splitting.},

To control the movement of DW ink droplets on dielectric substrates, the electrodes were embedded in the substrate. It is demonstrated that droplets of pure liquid inks, aqueous polymer solution inks, and carbon fiber suspension inks can be moved on multi-angled surfaces. Also, experimental results reveal that droplets of a commercial hydrogel, agar−agar, alginate, xanthan gum, and gum arabic can be moved by electrowetting. Droplets of sizes 200 μm−3 mm were manipulated and moved by the electric field on different dielectric substrates accurately and repeatedly. Effective electrowetting-based control and movement of droplets were observed on horizontal, vertical, and even inverted substrates. These findings imply the feasibility and potential application of electrowetting as a flexible, rapid, and new method for ink droplet control in 3D printing processes.},

  abstract = {Digital (droplet-based) microfluidic technology offers an attractive platform for implementing a wide variety of biochemical laboratory protocols, such as point-of-care diagnosis, DNA analysis, target detection, and drug discovery. A digital microfluidic biochip consists of a patterned array of electrodes on which tiny fluid droplets are manipulated by electrical actuation sequences to perform various fluidic operations, for example, dispense, transport, mix, or split. However, because of the inherent uncertainty of fluidic operations, the outcome of biochemical experiments performed on-chip can be erroneous even if the chip is tested a priori and deemed to be defect-free. In this article, we address an important error recoverability problem in the context of sample preparation. We assume a cyberphysical environment, in which the physical errors, when detected online at selected checkpoints with integrated sensors, can be corrected through recovery techniques. However, almost all prior work on error recoverability used checkpointing-based               rollback               approach, that is, re-execution of certain portions of the protocol starting from the previous checkpoint. Unfortunately, such techniques are expensive both in terms of assay completion time and reagent cost, and can never ensure full error-recovery in deterministic sense. We consider imprecise droplet mix-split operations and present a novel               roll-forward               approach where the erroneous droplets, thus produced, are used in the error-recovery process, instead of being discarded or remixed. All erroneous droplets participate in the dilution process and they mutually cancel or reduce the concentration-error when the target droplet is reached. We also present a rigorous analysis that reveals the role of volumetric-error on the concentration of a sample to be prepared, and we describe the layout of a lab-on-chip that can execute the proposed cyberphysical dilution algorithm. Our analysis reveals that fluidic errors caused by unbalanced droplet splitting can be classified as being either               critical               or               non-critical               , and only those of the former type require correction to achieve error-free sample dilution. Simulation experiments on various sample preparation test cases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Efficient actuation of liquid slugs in microfluidic circuits is a matter of interest in droplet-based microfluidic applications. In this paper, the Electrowetting On Dielectric (EWOD) actuation of a liquid slug fully confined in a microchannel is studied. A set of experiments are conducted in which the mean transport velocity of a liquid slug enclosed in a microchannel of rectangular cross section and actuated by EWOD method is measured. A printed circuit board based (PCB-based) microfluidic chip is used as the platform, and the transport velocity of the slug is measured by processing the images recorded by a high-speed camera while the slug moves in the channel. To investigate the effect of microchannel geometry on the mean transport velocity of the slugs, different channel heights and widths (ranging between 250 െ 440 ݉ߤ and 1-2 mm, respectively) as well as different liquid volumes (ranging between 2.94 െ 5.15 ܮߤ ) are tested and slug velocities up to 14.9 mm/s are achieved. A theoretical model is also developed to analyze the effect of involved parameters on the transport velocity. The results show that, within the range of design parameters considered in this study, for a constant slug volume and channel width, increasing the channel height enhances the velocity. Moreover, keeping the slug volume and channel height fixed, the transport velocity is increased by enlarging the channel width. An inverse proportionality between the slug length and velocity is also observed. These results are also shown to agree with the theoretical model developed.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting on Dielectric (EWOD) method is widely used to actuate microdroplets sandwiched between parallel plates in microfluidic chips. However, utilization of this method to transport liquid plugs in conduits has not been comprehensively studied to date. In this paper, the EWOD actuation of a liquid plug confined in a microchannel of rectangular cross section is numerically studied using OpenFoam. The effect of various parameters including electrowetting dimensionless number (η), contact angle hysteresis (CAH), dynamic viscosity and surface tension coefficient on transport velocity is investigated by employing an interactive simulation approach. The transport velocity can be considered a gauge to evaluate the actuation efficiency. The results show that, increasing η has a greater impact on velocity for larger values of CAH. In addition, it is shown that the average velocity increases linearly by increasing the surface tension coefficient. An inverse relationship between velocity and dynamic viscosity is also observed. These trends are in accordance with the theoretical model developed for a similar case in the literature. To estimate the maximum possible gap size between electrodes (MPGS), non-actuated distance travelled before the liquid plug comes to stop is evaluated. The results show that by decreasing the values of η, the effect of changing CAH on MPGS becomes more substantial.},

  abstract = {Creatinine is a biochemical waste that is disseminated continually inside human blood. A synthetic polymer is developed in this study using Molecularly Imprinted Polymerization (MIP) technology with the precipitation polymerization method. The MIP polymer is used for finding the levels of creatinine from human serum samples with different creatinine concentrations. The MIP polymer is very selective to the specific adsorption of the molecules of creatinine. The produced MIP polymer is suitable for evaluating creatinine concentrations until 50 parts per million (ppm) that is thrice greater than the standard. The fabrication of chip-sized Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS)-based interdigital (ID) sensors is described. The operation of the MEMS sensor is verified using the technique of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). The presented details of the development of MEMS ID sensor and creatinine specific MIP polymer are for detecting raised biotoxic waste levels, i.e. creatinine management is part of our research. The raised levels need monitoring by frequent pathological visits to those patients who have impaired kidney functioning. The complete system will be helpful for creatinine management at any time from home at a low cost. While early detection of an increase in creatinine and monitoring of kidney health to prevent further healthrelated complications are the goal of this research, results of up to 50 ppm are accessed. Until 50 ppm of MIP functionality is checked for confirming the MIP polymer adsorption of creatinine and the results are shown, which helps establish the sensing technology even if used for a patient with a high creatinine level.},

  abstract = {Accurate, efficient, inexpensive, and multi-parameter monitoring of water quality parameters is critical for continued water safety from developed urban regions to resource-limited or sparsely populated areas. This study describes an integrated sensing system with solution-processed pH, free chlorine, and temperature sensors on a common glass substrate. The pH and temperature sensors are fabricated by low-cost inkjet printing of palladium/palladium oxide and silver. The potentiometric pH sensor has a high sensitivity of 60.6 mV/pH and a fast response of 15 s. The Wheatstone-bridge-based temperature sensor shows an immediate response of 3.35 mV/°C towards temperature change. The free chlorine sensor is based on an electrochemically modified pencil lead, which exhibits a stable and reproducible sensitivity of 342 nA/ppm for hypochlorous acid. Such a free chlorine sensor is potentiostat-free and calibration-free, so it is easy-to-use. The three sensors are connected to a field-programmable gate array board for data collection, analysis and display, with real-time pH and temperature compensation for free chlorine sensing. The developed sensing system is user-friendly, cost-effective, and can monitor water samples in real-time with an accuracy of {$>$}82\%. This platform enables water quality monitoring by nonprofessionals in a simple manner.},

  abstract = {As one of the most popular research hotspot of lab-on-chip, digital microfluidic (DMF) technology based on the principle of electrowetting has unique advantages of high-precision, low cost and programmable control. However, due to the limitation of electrodes number, the throughput is hard to further upgrade. Therefore, active matrix electrowetting-on-dielectric (AM-EWOD) technology is a solution to acquire larger scale of driving electrodes. However, the process of manufacturing of AM-EWOD based on thin-film-transistor (TFT) is complex and expensive. Besides, the driving voltage of DMF chip is usually much higher than that of common display products.In this paper, a solution for mass production of AM-EWOD based on amorphous silicon (a-Si) is provided. Samples of 32 × 32 matrix AM-EWOD chips was designed and manufactured. A boost circuit was integrated into the pixel, which can raise the pixel voltage up by about 50\%. Customized designed Printed Circuit Board (PCB) was used to supply the timing signals and driving voltage to make the motion of droplets programmable. The process of moving, mixing and generation of droplets was demonstrated.The minimum voltage in need was about 20 V and a velocity of up to 96 mm/s was achieved. Such an DMF device with large-scale matrix and low driving voltage will be very suitable for POCT applications.},

Here we demonstrate that dielectrowetting can be applied to actively control the dynamics of droplet impact. Moreover, we demonstrate that dielectrowetting can be used to prevent droplet bouncing and suppress splashing. In our experiments, the dielectrowetting effect is produced on a flat substrate by two thin interdigitated electrodes connected to an alternating current potential. Our findings show that the strength of the electric potential can affect the dynamic contact angle and regulate the spreading, splashing and receding dynamics at the right time-scales.},

  abstract = {Buffer liquids currently used in biotechnology contain surfactants. These surfactants modify the wetting properties of the liquid and affect the behavior of droplets in electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) microsystems. An analysis of the effect of surfactants in EWOD-based microsystems, at equilibrium and in a non-equilibrium state, is given here. First, a reference for the value of the surface tension and its time variation is obtained by the use of the pendant drop method, showing that the time variation of the surface tension follows a decreasing exponential law. Next, equilibrium experiments have been performed on a specially designed EWOD experimental microsystem. It has been observed that the Lippmann–Young theoretical equation for electrowetting is satisfied at equilibrium, even in the presence of surfactants. However, at the CMC, equilibrium surface tension values are different from those obtained by the pendant drop method. This difference is explained by an internal convective motion that remixes the surfactants. This internal motion is observed by following the motion of fluorophores. Consequently, surfactant concentrations about ten times the CMC are required to obtain the same values of the surface tension in the pendant drop method and by EWOD measurements. In a second section, it is shown that the behavior of surfactant-loaded droplets in EWOD-based microsystems can be explained by considering that the surface tension relaxes with time according to the exponential law found in the first section.},

  abstract = {A wireless sensor network (WSN) has a huge potential in water ecology monitoring applications. The integration of WSN to a portable sensing device offers the feasibility of sensing distribution capability, on-site data measurements, and remote sensing abilities. Due to the advancement of WSN technology, unexpected contamination events in water environments can be observed continuously. Local Area Network (LAN), Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) and Internet web-based are commonly used as a gateway unit for data communication via local base computer using standard Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) or General Packet Radio Services (GPRS). However, WSN construction is costly and a growing static infrastructure increases the energy consumptions. Hence, a growing trend of smartphone-based application in the field of water monitoring is a surrogate approach to engage mobile base stations for in-field analysis that are driven by the expanding adaptation of Bluetooth, ZigBee and standard Wi-Fi routers. Owing to the fact that smartphones are portable and accessible, mobile data collection from WSN in remote locations are achievable. This paper comprehensively reviews the detection of water contaminants using smartphone-based applications in accordance with WSN technologies. In this paper, some recommendations and prospective views on the developments of water quality monitoring will be discussed.},

Approximately 1 in 5 cases of mortality due to waterborne diseases involve children, and over 1.5 million cases of waterborne disease occur every year. In the developing world, this makes waterborne diseases the second highest cause of mortality. Such cases of waterborne disease are thought to be caused by poor sanitation, water infrastructure, public knowledge, and lack of suitable water monitoring systems. Conventional laboratory-based techniques are inadequate for effective on-site water quality monitoring purposes. This is due to their need for excessive equipment, operational complexity, lack of affordability, and long sample collection to data analysis times. In this review, we discuss the conventional techniques used in modern-day water quality testing. We discuss the future challenges of water quality testing in the developing world and how conventional techniques fall short of these challenges. Finally, we discuss the development of electrochemical biosensors and current research on the integration of these devices with microfluidic components to develop truly integrated, portable, simple to use and cost-effective devices for use by local environmental agencies, NGOs, and local communities in low-resource settings.},

Use of a smartphone for nucleic acid testing has shown promising progress in endpoint as well as real-time analysis of various disease conditions. The emergence of smartphone-based POC devices together with paper-based sensors, microfluidic chips and digital droplet assays are used currently in many situations to provide quantitative detection of nucleic acid targets.

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) are designed to efficiently carry out biochemical and biomedical analysis in a miniaturized way. DMFBs offer various advantages over traditional laboratory techniques and reduces cost, and increases automation and software programmability. Scheduling of microfluidic operations is the first and essential step in the fluidic-level synthesis of DMFBs, while the other two are the module placement and droplet routing. Scheduling DMFB operations is a multiconstrained optimization problem, and the particular decision problem is NP-complete. We propose a hybrid artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm using generalized N-point crossover (GNX) based scheduling of DMFB operations. Proposed ABC-GNX perturbs through search space, evaluates various schedules possible, and returns the best schedule among the evaluated schedules. Simple list scheduling based heuristic algorithms can explore a single schedule based on the sequence generated by the priority function. Iterative improvement based search algorithms explore the search space and evaluate more schedules, but the proposed ABC-GNX algorithm produces optimal solutions in shorter execution times. Simulation results show that the proposed ABC-GNX produces a higher number of optimal completion times and faster execution times than existing algorithms.},

  abstract = {The continuous surveillance of drinking water is extremely important to provide early warning of contamination and to ensure continuous supplies of healthy drinking water. Isolation and detection of a particular type of pathogen present at low concentration in a large volume of water, concentrating the analyte in a small detection volume, and removing detection inhibiting factors from the concentrated sample, present the three most important challenges for water quality monitoring laboratories. Combining advanced biological detection methods (e.g., nucleic acid-based or immunology-based protocols) with microfluidics and immunomagnetic separation techniques that exploit functionalized magnetic particles has tremendous potential for realization of an integrated system for pathogen detection, in particular, of waterborne pathogens. Taking advantage of the unique properties of magnetic particles, faster, more sensitive, and more economical diagnostic assays can be developed that can assist in the battle against microbial pathogenesis. In this review, we highlight current technologies and methods used for realization of magnetic particle-based microfluidic integrated waterborne pathogen isolation and detection systems, which have the potential to comply in future with regulatory water quality monitoring requirements.},

One of the potential fields of application for this technology is in Point-of-Care (POC) devices, ideally allowing for portable, fully integrated, easy to use, low cost diagnostic platforms. Two main approaches exist to induce Dielectrophoresis (DEP) on suspended particles, i.e., electrode-based DEP and insulator-based DEP, each featuring different advantages and disadvantages. However, a shared concern lies in the input voltage used to generate the electric field necessary for DEP to take place. Therefore, input voltage can determine portability of a microfluidic device.

  abstract = {EIS is mainly employed for immunosensors and aptasensors, but opportunities exist for enzymatic, composite and other sensor strategies.           ,              Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful technique for both quantitative and qualitative analysis. This review uses a systematic approach to examine how electrodes are tailored for use in EIS-based applications, describing the chemistries involved in sensor design, and discusses trends in the use of bio-based and non-bio-based electrodes. The review finds that immunosensors are the most prevalent sensor strategy that employs EIS as a quantification technique for target species. The review also finds that bio-based electrodes, though capable of detecting small molecules, are most applicable for the detection of complex molecules. Non-bio-based sensors are more often employed for simpler molecules and less often have applications for complex systems. We surmise that EIS has advanced in terms of electrode designs since our last review on the subject, although there are still inconsistencies in terms of equivalent circuit modelling for some sensor types. Removal of ambiguity from equivalent circuit models may help advance EIS as a choice detection method, allowing for lower limits of detection than traditional electrochemical methods such as voltammetry or amperometry.},

Here, microfluidic devices are reviewed that generate those inhomogeneous electric fields with insulating posts or constrictions, an approach called electrodeless or insulator‐based dielectrophoresis. Possible advantages compared to electrode‐based designs are a less complex, monolithic fabrication process with low‐cost polymeric substrates and no metal surface deterioration within the area of sample analysis. The electrodeless design has led to novel devices, implementing the functionality directly into the channel geometry and covering many areas of bioanalysis, like manipulation and separation of particles, cells, DNA, and proteins.},

MES are made of amorphous metallic glass ribbons and are wireless and passive, meaning that it is convenient to monitor or measure the parameters related to biomedical engineering. MES are based on the inverse magnetoelastic (Villari) effect. When MES are subjected to mechanical stress, their magnetic susceptibility will change accordingly. And the susceptibility of MES is directly related to their magnetic permeability. The varying permeability can positively reflect the applied stress. The various detection methods that have been developed for different field applications include measurement of force, stress, and strain, monitoring of various chemical indexes, and consideration of different biomedical parameters such as the degradation rate and force conditions of artificial bone, as well as various physiological indexes including ammonia level, glucose concentration, bacteria growth, and blood coagulation.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic has recently been under intensive study, as an effective method to carry out liquid manipulation in Lab-On-a-Chip (LOC) systems. Among droplet actuation forces, ElectroWetting on Dielectric (EWOD) and Liquid DiElectroPhoresis (LDEP) are powerful tools, used in many LOC platforms. Such digital microfluidic transductions do not require integration of complex mechanical components such as pumps and valves to perform the fluidic operations. However, although LDEP has been proved to be efficient to carry and manipulate biological components in insulating liquids, this microfluidic transduction requires several hundreds of volts at relatively high frequencies (kHz to MHz). With the purpose to develop integrated microsystems µ-TAS (Micro Total Analysis System) or Point of Care systems, the goal here is to reduce such high actuation voltage, the power consumption, though using standard dielectric materials. This paper gives key rules to determine the best tradeoff between liquid manipulation efficiency, low-power consumption and robustness of microsystems using LDEP actuation. This study leans on an electromechanical model to describe liquid manipulation that is applied to an experimental setup, and provides precise quantification of both actuation voltage Vth and frequency fc thresholds between EWOD and LDEP regimes. In particular, several parameters will be investigated to quantify Vth and fc, such as the influence of the chip materials, the electrodes size and the device configurations. Compared to current studies in the field, significant reduction of both Vth and fc is achieved by optimization of the aforementioned parameters.},

  abstract = {As one of the most common inorganic ions in daily food and ecological environment, nitrate (NO3−) is potentially harmful to both environment and humans. Therefore, the detection of nitrate concentration is quite important. Chemical sensors, as analytical measurement tools, usually demonstrate high selectivity, fast analysis speed, simple structure, convenient operation, and low cost and are considered to be a promising method for ion identification and detection. In this paper, a miniaturized electrochemical electrode is fabricated based on the microfabrication technology, and an electrochemical sensor for the detection of nitrate concentration in water is developed by combining the deposition technology of nanometal particles with electrochemical analysis technique. The developed electrochemical sensor utilizes electrochemical deposition to prepare a copper (Cu) granular sensitive film with a branch-cluster structure on the surface of a circular working electrode (Pt). Using copper’s characteristics of electrocatalytic reduction of NO3− in the acid solution environment (pH\,=\,2), the concentration of NO3− in the water sample was calculated by measuring the reduction current on the working electrode when the electrocatalytic reduction reaction of NO3− occurred on the surface of the copper-sensitive membrane. The sensitive film is characterized and detected both with the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) technique; and the microsensor is used to detect nitrate standard samples; a high detection sensitivity (24.9\,μA/mmol·L−1) is achieved in the concentration range of 0.0 to 3.0\,mmol/L. At the same time, a MEMS three-electrode sensor without gold wire bonding and insulating glue packaging is designed, and an automatic detection system is constructed with a STM32f103 microcontroller as the controller to realize the automated detecting process for nitrate ions. At the same time, a distributed system is constructed, which can describe the nitrate concentration in every position of the water area and realize the monitoring of the whole water area. The detection system can meet the working environment under most conditions and has practical significance.},

This natural disaster has put millions of lives at risk and forcing the people to search for waster. However, the water scarcity problem was not just limited to the countries that were strike by El-Nino. Poor water management and climate change were bringing droughts to Asia and the Pacific. The water scarcity worldwide has recently reached the alarming rate and received the greatest attention among the people. Membrane technology is an innovative technology which has proven to be effective and efficient for water and wastewater treatment. Therefore, membrane technology has high potential to be employed for the treatment of lake water, mine water, and tube well water in increasing the fresh water production for reuse purpose. The objective of this work is to investigate the potential of membrane technology for treating the lake water, mine water, and tube well water. A laboratory bench-scale dead-end test rig was used in this study to evaluate the performance of commercial flatsheet nanofiltration (NF) - NF270 and reverse osmosis (RO) - BW30 membranes. Both source water and treated water were analysed based on chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), colour, total suspended solid (TSS), pH, and temperature. In order to prove the reuse concept of membrane technology, the permeate water quality after the membrane filtration process was compared with National Water Quality Standard (NWQS) of Malaysia. The results from this study shown that the permeate water filtered by NF270 and BW30 membranes were able to meet the NWQS Class III, which was suitable to recycled for livestock drinking and irrigation purposes.},

Copper clad is a promising material for microfluidic mold fabrication due to its: smooth surface, availability of different copper and dielectric layer thicknesses, affordability and easiness of machining. In addition, 3D printing technology was investigated as a rapid prototyping technique to achieve appropriate master mold fabrication. Several molds with different channel features (width and height) were fabricated from each technique and were compared from the stand point of channel resolution, minimum space between channels, surface roughness, fabrication time and cost. Finally, microfluidic chips were fabricated using those molds by using molding technique based on Poly (dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). The collection of these techniques offers precise channel heights starting from 15 μm and different channel width ranging from 50 μm in a short time fabrication process (i.e. 5min), without needing clean room equipment for molds fabrication.},

  abstract = {We developed an optical, microfabrication-free approach for performing real-time measurements of individual droplet characteristics (frequency of production, velocity, and length) flowing in a transparent microfluidic channel. Our approach consists in an interpretation of the differential signal produced by a pair of photodiodes connected head-to-tail due to the variations of illumination at the passage of a droplet. We checked the relevance of this zero-background method by comparing results to video measurements, and observed a very good agreement at rates up to the kHz range. Moreover, since the measured values are stored in a simple text file, flow characterization over very long times (several hours) becomes accessible. We applied this facility to perform three examples of longterm studies: stationary regimes, transient regimes, and the effect of an external forcing. Several unexpected features, like long-period fluctuations, can thus be evidenced.},

  abstract = {Droplet microfluidics has enabled many recent applications in high-throughput screening and diagnostics. Little work has been done, however, to analyze the performance of droplet-based assays. This review aims to apply what is known in the literature to the analysis of the performance metrics of droplet-based assays, with specific relevance to diagnostic and biomedical applications based on two processes: enzymatic reactions and cell culture in droplets. By considering the physical scaling of individual processes—droplet generation, reaction kinetics, cell growth, and droplet interrogation—it is possible to extract a practical relationship between input parameters (e.g., droplet size and droplet polydispersity) and the output characteristics (e.g., throughput, dynamic range, and accuracy) of the assay. This review can serve as a guide to the design of droplet-based assays for achieving desired performance. While the focus is on assays based on enzymatic reactions and cell cultures, a similar analysis can be applied to other assays based on polymerase chain reaction and the detection of nucleic acids.},

Low power consumption, low sample and reagent volumes, small size, and rapid fluid transport are features of electrowetting microfluidic platforms that will enable the development of cost-effective, rapid time-to-result, and portable point-of-care diagnostic devices. Microresonator sensors are an excellent sensor technology for integration into these microfluidic systems, because they perform high sensitivity detection of proteins, DNA, and other biologically relevant molecules while tolerating a droplet oil encapsulation layer. This paper reports on a SU-8 polymer microresonator embedded in the top plate of the EWD system, which enables addressing of the sensor with a single droplet of {$<$} 100 nL in volume and enables droplets to be moved onto and off of the sensor. This system is the first to demonstrate analyte measurement by electrowetting actuation of droplets onto and off of a top plate integrated microresonator sensor. Both photolithographically patterned and electron beam lithographically patterned microresonator sensors were tested, and the effect of a conventional filler medium, silicone oil, on the sensor sensitivity was investigated.},

A Bdigital[ electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWD) microfluidics system with integrated optical sensors is a promising platform for portable POC diagnostic devices that integrate sample preparation with sensing. Herein is reported the highest sensitivity and figure of merit (FOM) microresonator sensor integrated with an EWD system to date [FOM is the product of the quality (Q) factor and the sensitivity (S)]. The EWD system embedded microresonator sensor had a measured FOM of 0:60 106 nm/RIU ðQ ¼ 8; 400; S ¼ 72 nm/RIUÞ in 2-cSt silicone oil and water, which is nearly double the best FOM previously reported for an microresonator placed on top of an EWD system. Additionally, a nominal FOM of 1:2 106 nm/RIU ðQ ¼ 15 000; S ¼ 82 nm/RIUÞ was measured for the vertically coupled sensor fabricated on a standard SiO2/Si substrate. This FOM is the highest reported to date for SU-8 microresonators probed at wavelengths around 1550 nm. These results indicate that high-performance polymer sensors can be integrated with low-power-consumption EWD microfluidics sample preparation systems toward the development of portable POC diagnostic devices.},

  abstract = {Potential applications of digital microfluidic (DMF) biochips now include several areas of real-life applications like environmental monitoring, water and air pollutant detection, and food processing to name a few. In order to achieve sufficiently high throughput for these applications, several instances of the same bioassay may be required to be executed concurrently on different samples. As a straightforward implementation, several identical biochips can be integrated on a single substrate as a               multichip               to execute the assay for various samples concurrently. Controlling individual electrodes of such a chip by independent pins may not be acceptable since it increases the cost of fabrication. Thus, in order to keep the overall pin-count within an acceptable bound, all the respective electrodes of these individual pieces are connected internally underneath the chip so that they can be controlled with a single external control pin. In this article, we present an orientation strategy for layout of a multichip that reduces routing congestion and consequently facilitates wire routing for the electrode array. The electrode structure of the individual pieces of the multichip may be either direct-addressable or pin-constrained. The method also supports a hierarchical approach to wire routing that ensures scalability. In this scheme, the size of the biochip in terms of the total number of electrodes may be increased by a factor of four by increasing the number of routing layers by only one. In general, for a multichip with 4                                n                              identical blocks, (               n               + 1) layers are sufficient for wire routing.},

The digital control of droplets in a closed hydrophobic interface enables the complete removal of exogenous DNA, sufficient cell lysis, and lossless amplicon recovery, achieving the low coefficient of variation and high coverage at multiple scales. The single-cell genomic variations profiling performs the excellent detection of copy number variants with the smallest bin of 150 kb and single-nucleotide variants with allele dropout rate of 5.2\%, holding great promise for broader applications of single-cell genomics.},

  abstract = {Biomarkers based on DNA methylation have attracted wide attention in biomedical research due to their potential clinical value. Therefore, a sensitive and accurate method for DNA methylation detection is highly desirable for the discovery and diagnostics of human diseases, especially cancers. Here, an integrated, low-cost, and portable point-of-care (POC) device is presented to analyze DNA methylation, which integrates the process of pyrosequencing in a digital microfluidic chip. Without additional equipment and complicated operation, droplets are manipulated by patterned electrodes with individually programmed control. The system exhibited an excellent sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) of 10 pg and a comparable checkout down to 5\% methylation level within 30 min, which offered a potential substitute for the detection of DNA methylation. With the advantages of portability, ease of use, high accuracy, and low cost, the POC platform shows great potential for the analysis of tumorspecific circulating DNA.},

The electrodes of a chip plate for active electrowetting actuation of digital drops and an ECS for multiple analysis assays are fabricated by affordable printing techniques. For enhanced sensitivity of the sensor, the working electrode is modified through the electrochemical method, namely by reducing graphene with voltammetry and coating gold nanoparticles by amperometry. Detachable sensor and absorber modules are assembled modularly on an open chip plate, forming various novel hybridized open–closed chip formats. By varying the coupled or decoupled sensor modules, excellent detection of three diagnostic biological molecules is demonstrated (glucose, dopamine, and uric acid in human serum).

  abstract = {Digital microfluidics is an elegant technique based on single droplets for the design, composition, and manipulation of microfluidic systems. In digital microfluidics, especially in the electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) system, each droplet acts as an independent reactor, which enables a wide range of multiple parallel biological and chemical reactions at the microscale. EWOD digital microfluidics reduces reagent and energy consumption, accelerates analysis, enables point-of-care diagnostic, simplifies integration with sensors, etc. Such a digital microfluidic system is especially relevant for droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), thanks to its nanoliter droplets and well-controlled volume distribution. At low DNA concentration, these small volumes allow less than one DNA strand per droplet on average (limited dilution) so that after a fixed number of PCR cycles (endpoint PCR), only the DNA in droplets containing the sequence of interest has been amplified and can be detected by fluorescence to yield an accurate count of the sequences of interest using statistical models. Focusing on ddPCR, this article summarizes the latest development and research on EWOD technology for droplet PCR over the last decade.},

  abstract = {Liquid biopsy is emerging as a potential diagnostic tool for prostate cancer (PC) prognosis and diagnosis. Unfortunately, most circulating tumor cells (CTC) technologies, such as AdnaTest or Cellsearch®, critically rely on the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) marker, limiting the possibility of detecting cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) and mesenchymal-like cells (EMT-CTCs) that are present during PC progression. In this context, dielectrophoresis (DEP) is an epCAM independent, label-free enrichment system that separates rare cells simply on the basis of their specific electrical properties. As compared to other technologies, DEP may represent a superior technique in terms of running costs, cell yield and specificity. However, because of its higher complexity, it still requires further technical as well as clinical development. DEP can be improved by the use of microfluid, nanostructured materials and fluoro-imaging to increase its potential applications. In the context of cancer, the usefulness of DEP lies in its capacity to detect CTCs in the bloodstream in their epithelial, mesenchymal, or epithelial–mesenchymal phenotype forms, which should be taken into account when choosing CTC enrichment and analysis methods for PC prognosis and diagnosis.},

This method enables manipulation of droplets several times smaller than the electrode size and, importantly, minimizes evaporation, contamination, and exposure of the sample to high voltages. We demonstrate various modes of droplet loading, transporting, and unloading. Using advanced imaging processing techniques, we obtained detailed information about the shuttle and droplet centroids. Furthermore, varying water concentration on the soft shuttle allows for modulation of the diffusion kinetics of samples into the shuttle, which also can be controlled with soft shuttle actuation velocity. We believe that this novel approach for the manipulation of droplets will advance the field of droplet-based open microfluidics and can be potentially useful for applications in biotechnology, diagnostics, or analytical chemistry.},

Although various droplet detection methods have been employed to achieve monodisperse droplets, the capacitive method stands out for its ease of use and rapid response, enabling real-time feedback control. However, this method has limitations in terms of significantly altering the droplet size, resulting in increased continuous phase consumption and the need for microchannel and sensing component replacements. In response, we present the Sensing Area-Variable Electrode (SAVE), which is designed to produce monodisperse droplets across a broad size range without excessive continuous phase consumption and without requiring the frequent replacement of sensing components. The experimental results demonstrate that using the SAVE electrode enables the generation of monodisperse 0.2, 0.4, and 1.0 nL droplets by simply replacing the disposable microchannel while reusing the sensing components. Moreover, the adaptable number of droplets achieved by microchannel replacement allows the SAVE electrode to be effectively utilized in droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) assays, providing a balance between sensitivity and throughput. Consequently, the SAVE electrode addresses the limitations of the capacitive detection method and offers a versatile solution for various droplet-based biological and chemical processes, including ddPCR assays.},

Adding only a single series resistor to existing AC droplet actuation circuits, the platform is simple to implement and has negligible effect on actuation voltage. To accurately measure the complex voltage across the resistor (and hence current through the device and droplet), the designed system is based on software-implemented lock-in amplification detection of the voltage drop across the resistor which filters out noise, enabling high-resolution and low-limit signal recovery. We observe picoliter sensitivity with linear correlation of voltage to volume extending to the microliter volumes that can be handled by digital microfluidic devices. Due to the minimal hardware, the system is robust and measurements are highly repeatable. The detection technique provides both phase and magnitude information of the real-time current flowing through the droplet for a full impedance measurement. The sensitivity and resolution of this platform enables it to distinguish between various liquids which, as demonstrated in this paper, could potentially be extended to quantify solute concentrations, liquid mixtures, and presence of analytes.},

The method allows for measurements of acoustic interaction forces between particles located in arbitrary positions such as in between a pressure node and a pressure antinode. By utilizing a model that considers both density- and compressibility-dependent effects, the observed particle−particle interaction dynamics can be well understood. Two differently sized polystyrene micro-particles (4.8 and 25\,μm, respectively) were used in order to achieve pronounced interaction effects. The particulate was subjected to a 2-MHz ultrasonic standing wave in a microfluidic channel, such as commonly used for acoustophoresis. Observation of deflections in the particle pathways shows that the particle interaction force is not negligible under this circumstance and has to be considered in accurate particle manipulation applications. The effect is primarily pronounced when the distance between two particles is small, the sizes of the particles are different, and the acoustic properties of the particles are different relative to the media. As predicted by theory, the authors also observe that the interaction forces are affected by the angle between the inter-particle centerline and the axis of the standing wave propagation direction.},

The combined effect of chip dimensions on particle separation was investigated using the Monte Carlo approach. Acoustophoretic chips made of silicon, glass, and acrylic were fabricated and compared in terms of microparticle focusing performance.

  abstract = {Separation and sorting of micron-sized particles has great importance in diagnostics, chemical and biological analyses, food and chemical processing and environmental assessment. By employing the unique characteristics of microscale flow phenomena, various techniques have been established for fast and accurate separation and sorting of microparticles in a continuous manner. The advancements in microfluidics enable sorting technologies that combine the benefits of continuous operation with small-sized scale suitable for manipulation and probing of individual particles or cells. Microfluidic sorting platforms require smaller sample volume, which has several benefits in terms of reduced cost of reagents, analysis time and less invasiveness to patients for sample extraction. Additionally, smaller size of device together with lower fabrication cost allows massive parallelization, which makes high-throughput sorting possible. Both passive and active separation and sorting techniques have been reported in literature. Passive techniques utilize the interaction between particles, flow field and the channel structure and do not require external fields. On the other hand, active techniques make use of external fields in various forms but offer better performance. This paper provides an extensive review of various passive and active separation techniques including basic theories and experimental details. The working principles are explained in detail, and performances of the devices are discussed.},

  abstract = {Commercialization of a chemical sensor relies on the sensing performance, stability and selectivity for detecting gases at different environmental conditions. Here, we report ammonia sensors based on copper oxide (CuO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposite with hierarchical structure. The employed surfactant-free hydrothermal method for the sensing element synthesis is found to be efficient in yielding hierarchical nanoarchitectures. The synthesized CuO and rGO-CuO nanocomposite were characterized for structural, morphological, optical and surface adsorption properties. In order to understand the sensing properties, the printed sensors with pristine CuO and rGO-CuO composite were subjected to concentration, temperature and time dependent ammonia sensing measurements. The rGO-CuO nanocomposite sensor showed an enhanced sensor response of 13 at room temperature (30 °C) and 30 at 300 °C, respectively which is a 10-fold increase as compared to pristine CuO based device. The selectivity experiments were carried out by exposing the sensor to ethanol, methanol, acetone and ammonia. The sensor showed highest response towards ammonia in comparison with other test gases. The observed sensing performance suggest the applicability of the present sensors to room temperature and elevated temperature operations.},

  abstract = {The use of acoustic energy to manipulate particles and cells (acoustophoresis) is a well-studied and popular technique in microfluidic microscopy applications. This powerful and gentle method has typically required the construction of costly and labour intensive resonating chambers. A new fabrication method for acoustophoretic resonators is presented, using inexpensive materials and without the need for cleanrooms or the special equipment typically found within them. By utilizing a simple glass and polyimide sandwiching technique, single, bifurcating, and trifurcating microchannels were built and tested. Various half and full wavelength transversal resonators were established in microchannel widths of 300, 600, and 750 µm using 1, 2.5, and 5 MHz ultrasound. In significantly simplifying the fabrication and prototyping of these microfluidic resonators we hope to address some of the major drawbacks preventing acoustophoresis technology from being incorporated into the toolkits of laboratories around the world.},

A great deal of effort has been devoted to improve and advance these devices with the goal of performing complete sets of biochemical assays on the device and possibly developing portable platforms for point of care applications. Among the different microfluidic systems used for such a purpose, digital microfluidics (DMF) shows high flexibility and capability of performing multiplex and parallel biochemical operations, and hence, has been considered as a suitable candidate for lab-on-a-chip applications. In this review, we discuss the most recent advances in the DMF platforms, and evaluate the feasibility of developing multifunctional packages for performing complete sets of processes of biochemical assays, particularly for point-of-care applications. The progress in the development of DMF systems is reviewed from eight different aspects, including device fabrication, basic fluidic operations, automation, manipulation of biological samples, advanced operations, detection, biological applications, and finally, packaging and portability of the DMF devices. Success in developing the lab-on-a-chip DMF devices will be concluded based on the advances achieved in each of these aspects.},

Engineers face significant challenges during the labor-intensive process of designing microfluidic devices, with very few specialized tools that help automate the process. Typical design iterations require the engineer to research the architecture, manually draft the device layout, optimize for manufacturing processes, and manually calculate and program the valve sequences that operate the microfluidic device. The problem compounds when engineers not only have to test the functionality of the chip but are also expected to optimize them for the robust execution of biological assays. In this paper, we present an interactive tool for designing continuous flow microfluidic devices. 3D               μ               F is the first completely open source interactive microfluidic system designer that readily supports state of the art design automation algorithms. Through various case studies, we show 3D               μ               F can be used to reproduce designs from literature, provide metrics for evaluating microfluidic design complexity and showcase how 3D               μ               F is a platform for integrating a wide assortment of engineering techniques used in the design of microfluidic devices as a part of the standard design workflow.},

The molecular structure of Cu-MOF was authenticated by single crystal x-ray studies. The prepared materials have been probed by various physicochemical characterization techniques. Due to the positive synergistic effects between Cu-MOF crystals and rGO nanosheets, the newly synthesized Cu-MOF/rGO hybrid delivers high charge storage efficiency (685.33 F g-1 at 1.6 A g-1), high energy (137.066 Wh kg-1) and power density (4800.04 W kg-1) and with excellent rate ability (retains 71.01\% of its initial capacitance at 8 A g-1). Furthermore, the long cycle life (91.91\% after 1000 cycles) of this hybrid indicates its high stability on the electrode surface. Additionally, the electrode modified with Cu-MOF/rGO hybrid performs exceptionally towards the electrochemical detection of nitrite in a wide dynamic linear range of 3-40000 µM (R2=0.99911), with a notable detection limit of 33 nm and high sensitivity of 43.736 µAµM-1 cm-2. The versatility of Cu-MOF/rGO modified electrode can be observed by distinguished selectivity in the presence of some common interfering species and also ability to detect nitrite in the real samples.},

The source of air pollution is commonly from drying process that emitted odor from its evaporation and heating phenomena. Industry uses wet scrubber technology as air pollution control from emitted odor from drying process. Preliminary identification in noncontrolled wet scrubber shown that wet scrubber efficiency around 47\%. Low efficiency wet scrubbing process causes rain drop of water vapor around drying process. This research used electrochemical based sensor MICS 5524 as ammonia monitoring instrument, assisted with arduino as microcontroller to regulate water discharge through valve controlling scrubbing process. This electrochemical based sensor reads ammonia based on voltage reads by Arduino microcontroller. Ammonia reading then control scrubbing process by adjusting valve opening for spray water distribution. Wet scrubber efficiency increases to 66,96\% due to water scrubbing control, also can save water utilization as high as 61,90\%, followed by absence of rain drop contains ammonia around drying process area.},

From 2010 to present day there have been 981 publications about DEP. Of 2600 total patents held by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, 106 were filed in 2019 alone. This review focuses on DEP-based technologies and application developments between 2010 and 2020, with an aim to highlight the progress and to identify potential areas for future research. A major trend over the last ten years has been the use of DEP techniques for biological and clinical applications. It has been used in various forms on a diverse array of biologically derived molecules and particles to manipulate and study them including proteins, exosomes, bacteria, yeast, stem cells, cancer cells, and blood cells. DEP has also been used to manipulate nano and micron sized particles in order to fabricate different structures. The next ten years are likely to see the increase in DEP related patent applications begin to result in a greater level of technology commercialization. Also during this time, innovations in DEP technology will likely be leveraged to continue the existing trend to further biological and medical focused applications as well as applications in microfabrication. As a tool leveraged by engineering and imaginative scientific design, DEP offers unique capabilities to manipulate small particles in precise ways that can help solve problems and enable scientific inquiry that cannot be addressed using conventional methods.},

  abstract = {We report the development and characterization of digital microfluidic (DMF) immobilized enzyme reactors (IMERs) for studying cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated drug metabolism on droplet scale. The on-chip IMERs consist of porous polymer (thiol-ene) monolith plugs prepared in situ by photopolymerization and functionalized with recombinant CYP1A1 isoforms (an important detoxification route for many drugs and other xenobiotics). The DMF devices also incorporate inexpensive, inkjet-printed microheaters for on-demand regio-specific heating of the IMERs to physiological temperature, which is crucial for maintaining the activity of the temperature-sensitive CYP reaction. For on-chip monitoring of the CYP activity, the DMF devices were combined with a commercial well-plate reader, and a custom fluorescence quantification method was developed for detection of the chosen CYP1A1 model activity (ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylation). The reproducibility of the developed assay was examined with the help of ten parallel CYP-IMERs. All CYP-IMERs provided statistically significant difference (in fluorescence response) compared to any of the negative controls (including room-temperature reactions). The average (n = 10) turnover rate was 20.3 ± 9.0 fmol resorufin per minute. Via parallelization, the concept of the droplet-based CYP-IMER developed in this study provides a viable approach to rapid and low-cost prediction of the metabolic clearance of new chemical entities in vitro.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The integration of smartphones and microfluidics is nowadays the best possible route to achieve effective point-of-need testing (PONT), a concept increasingly demanded in the fields of human health, agriculture, food safety, and environmental monitoring. Nevertheless, efforts are still required to integrally seize all the advantages of smartphones, as well as to share the developments in easily adoptable formats. For this purpose, here we present the free platform               appuente               ~that was designed for the easy integration of microfluidic chips, smartphones, and the cloud. It includes a mobile app for end users, which provides chip identification and tracking, guidance and control, processing, smart-imaging, result reporting and cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) integration. The platform also includes a web app for PONT developers, to easily customize their mobile apps and manage the data of administered tests. Three application examples were used to validate               appuente               : a dummy grayscale detector that mimics quantitative colorimetric tests, a root elongation assay for pesticide toxicity assessment, and a lateral flow immunoassay for leptospirosis detection. The platform openly offers fast prototyping of smartphone apps to the wide community of lab-on-a-chip developers, and also serves as a friendly framework for new techniques, IoT integration and further capabilities. Exploiting these advantages will certainly help to enlarge the use of PONT with real-time connectivity in the near future.},

  abstract = {Article Info Water disruption has always been a major issue in Malaysia. The reason for the frequent water disruption is due to the shutdown of water treatment plant (WTP) for unable to process contaminated raw water from the river. In wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), main source of ammonia is from the breakdown of proteins and amino acids in organic waste. Typically, ammonia is not fully removed from the WWTP and most of the ammonia is being discharged together with the plant effluent into the river streams. High levels of ammonia in the water exerts an oxygen demand which causes oxygen depletion. Hence, affecting the aquatic ecosystem and creates a toxic environment for the aquatic life. Biological treatment is known to be the most cost saving method as it only constructs of simple components, chemical free treatment and producing no harm by-products which later cause cost increment for additional treatment. Furthermore, biological treatment is capable in producing high quality treated drinking water that meets the standard water guidelines and regulations. In this paper, the aim is to conduct an overview on the application of biological treatment as an alternative treatment method of ammonia removal in water and wastewater treatment plant. This overview presents the cohesive approach of biological treatment in water and wastewater treatment plant, source of ammonia pollution, standard implies on ammonia concentration to control potential hazards, reported cases and recent pollution status of ammonia globally. In addition, the use of an artificial intelligence for model prediction and control strategies for water treatment have been included in this overview.},

Polymer based microfluidic devices offer particular advantages including those of cost and biocompatibility. Here, we describe direct and replication approaches for manufacturing of polymer microfluidic devices. Replications approaches require fabrication of mould or master and we describe different methods of mould manufacture, including mechanical (micro-cutting; ultrasonic machining), energy-assisted methods (electrodischarge machining, micro-electrochemical machining, laser ablation, electron beam machining, focused ion beam (FIB) machining), traditional micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) processes, as well as mould fabrication approaches for curved surfaces. The approaches for microfluidic device fabrications are described in terms of low volume production (casting, lamination, laser ablation, 3D printing) and high-volume production (hot embossing, injection moulding, and film or sheet operations).},

  abstract = {Immunoprecipitation (IP) is a common method for isolating a targeted protein from a complex sample such as blood, serum, or cell lysate. In particular, IP is often used as the primary means of target purification for the analysis by mass spectrometry of novel biologically derived pharmaceuticals, with particular utility for the identification of molecules bound to a protein target. Unfortunately, IP is a labor-intensive technique, is difficult to perform in parallel, and has limited options for automation. Furthermore, the technique is typically limited to large sample volumes, making the application of IP cleanup to precious samples nearly impossible. In recognition of these challenges, we introduce a method for performing microscale IP using magnetic particles and digital microfluidics (DMF-IP). The new method allows for 80\% recovery of model proteins from approximately microliter volumes of serum in a sample-to-answer run time of approximately 25 min. Uniquely, analytes are eluted from these small samples in a format compatible with direct analysis by mass spectrometry. To extend the technique to be useful for large samples, we also developed a macro-to-microscale interface called preconcentration using liquid intake by paper (P-CLIP). This technique allows for efficient analysis of samples {$>$}100× larger than are typically processed on microfluidic devices. As described herein, DMF-IP and P-CLIP-DMF-IP are rapid, automated, and multiplexed methods that have the potential to reduce the time and effort required for IP sample preparations with applications in the fields of pharmacy, biomarker discovery, and protein biology.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting is an electrocapillary phenomenon, i.e. the surface charge generated at the solid-liquid interface through an external voltage improves the wettability in the system. The YoungLippmann equation provides the simplest thermodynamic framework and describes electrowetting adequately. Saturation, i.e. the reduced or nullified effectiveness of the external voltage below a threshold contact angle value, was and remains the most controversial issue in the physics of electrowetting. A simple estimation of the limits of validity of the Young model is obtained by setting the solid-liquid interfacial tension to zero. This approach predicts acceptably the change in electrowetting mechanism but not the minimal value of the contact angle achievable during electrowetting. The mechanism of saturation is, in all probability, related to charge injection into the dielectric layer insulating the working electrode but physical details are scarce. Surface force and spectroscopic techniques should be deployed in order to improve our understanding of the surface charging of insulators immersed in conductive liquids. Electrowetting in solid-liquid-liquid systems is generally more effective and robust. Electrowetting offers new ways of studying the dynamics of liquid movement as it allows selective changes in the wettability of the system.},

DNA hybridization is then assessed using a digital camera attached to a Clare Chemical DR-45M dark reader non-UV transilluminator that uses visible light as an excitation source and a blue and amber filter to reveal fluorescence. This microfluidic approach significantly enhances hybridization by reducing the diffusion time between target DNA and the silica surface. The use of probe-functionalized beads as solid support also enhances the sensitivity and limit of detection due to a larger surface area per unit volume. This platform could be adapted for use in medical applications and environmental monitoring, including the detection of harmful organisms in the ballast water of ships.},

Reactors were fed with influents containing 0, 5, and 25 mg=L of GO (12 h cycles) for 11 days. Results showed that the ammonia removal efficiency increased as the GO dose varied within 5–25 mg=L in reactors after 7 days. The abundance of Firmicutes, Sphingobium, and Leuconostoc in reactors fed with GO at concentration of 25 mg=L were significantly higher than that in control reactors, and the abundance of Sphingobium increased with the increasing concentration of GO in reactors; however, the abundance of Klebsiella decreased with the increasing concentration of GO in reactors. The results indicated that a reasonable microbial community restructured by GO might play a crucial role in promoting ammonia removal.

  abstract = {Carbon is one of the versatile materials used in modern life for human welfare. It has a wide range of applications such as drug delivery, coatings, energy generation and storage, gas separation, water purification, sensor fabrication, and catalysis. Most of the widely used carbon materials are graphene and carbon nanotubes. Nonrenewable precursors (e.g., natural gas), toxic chemicals, and complex synthesis methods are often required for their preparation, limiting their wide practical applications. Besides these, biomass-derived carbons are attractive materials as they can be prepared simply from renewable biomass. However, their practical applications' success partially depends on their properties like size, shape, porosity, and presence of heteroatoms, which can be controlled by selecting the proper type of biomass, activating agent, and preparation method. It is noted that different species of plants have different chemical compositions and textures. This mini-review summarizes our group's recent sophisticated developments in agricultural-bio-waste-derived carbonaceous materials, including nanomaterials for electrocatalytic water splitting, electrochemical sensors, supercapacitors, water splitting, water treatment, gas separation, and enhance oil recovery. This offers valuable insights and essential guidelines towards the future design of agro-waste derived carbonaceous materials in various applications.},

  abstract = {The review paper presents a variety of methods for fabrication of PDMS-based microfluidic channels. Moreover, different strategies for tailoring the surface properties of PDMS microchannels and immobilization of biomolecules are discussed.           ,                             Microfluidics is an emerging and multidisciplinary field that is of great interest to manufacturers in medicine, biotechnology, and chemistry, as it provides unique tools for the development of point-of-care diagnostics, organs-on-chip systems, and biosensors. Polymeric microfluidics, unlike glass and silicon, offer several advantages such as low-cost mass manufacturing and a wide range of beneficial material properties, which make them the material of choice for commercial applications and high-throughput systems. Among polymers used for the fabrication of microfluidic devices, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) still remains the most widely used material in academia due to its advantageous properties, such as excellent transparency and biocompatibility. However, commercialization of PDMS has been a challenge mostly due to the high cost of the current fabrication strategies. Moreover, specific surface modification and functionalization steps are required to tailor the surface chemistry of PDMS channels (               e.g.               biomolecule immobilization, surface hydrophobicity and antifouling properties) with respect to the desired application. While significant research has been reported in the field of PDMS microfluidics, functionalization of PDMS surfaces remains a critical step in the fabrication process that is difficult to navigate. This review first offers a thorough illustration of existing fabrication methods for PDMS-based microfluidic devices, providing several recent advancements in this field with the aim of reducing the cost and time for mass production of these devices. Next, various conventional and emerging approaches for engineering the surface chemistry of PDMS are discussed in detail. We provide a wide range of functionalization techniques rendering PDMS microchannels highly biocompatible for physical or covalent immobilization of various biological entities while preventing non-specific interactions.},

  abstract = {Microfluidic devices have received wide attention and shown great potential in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Investigating cell response to various stimulations is much more accurate and comprehensive with the aid of microfluidic devices. In this study, we introduced a microfluidic device by which the matrix density as a mechanical property and the concentration profile of a biochemical factor as a chemical property could be altered. Our microfluidic device has a cell tank and a cell culture chamber to mimic both 2D to 3D and 3D to 3D migration of three types of cells. Fluid shear stress is negligible on the cells and a stable concentration gradient can be obtained by diffusion. The device was designed by a numerical simulation so that the uniformity of the concentration gradients throughout the cell culture chamber was obtained. Adult neural cells were cultured within this device and they showed different branching and axonal navigation phenotypes within varying nerve growth factor (NGF) concentration profiles. Neural stem cells were also cultured within varying collagen matrix densities while exposed to NGF concentrations and they experienced 3D to 3D collective migration. By generating vascular endothelial growth factor concentration gradients, adult human dermal microvascular endothelial cells also migrated in a 2D to 3D manner and formed a stable lumen within a specific collagen matrix density. It was observed that a minimum absolute concentration and concentration gradient were required to stimulate migration of all types of the cells. This device has the advantage of changing multiple parameters simultaneously and is expected to have wide applicability in cell studies.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, the importance of the blood particles separation is undeniable in medical fields and there are different sorts of separation methods accordingly. Acoustic cell separation is chosen in this paper. Also, numerical methods have been used to study the effect of geometrical factors on the separation of the particles before spending time and expenses in a trial and error manner experimentally. We have implemented a plenary finite-element-based simulation of separating blood particles such as white blood cells and platelets in an acoustic field using standing surface acoustic waves. In this paper, unlike previous works in which the channel is rectangular; the channel is trapezoidal in order to make the separation more efficient. By changing the trapezoidal leg angle, WBC’s distance from the midline will be different. The designed device is a bio-MEMS channel containing two inlets which are for the sheath flow and for the blood particles, a trapezoidal main channel, and three outlets. Two aluminum interdigital transducers are located on the LiNbO3 substrate. For creating the acoustic force, we have applied an alternating voltage to transducers. Blood particles will be moved toward the acoustic nodes because of the positive acoustic contrast factor. Since acoustic radiation force depends on the size of the particles and their compressibility, cells can be sorted according to their diameter and compressibility; hence, particles will be separated. For optimizing the device, we have changed the trapezoidal channel angle, the input voltage, and the flow rate.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) chips have emerged as popular actuators for droplet-based digital microfluidic biochips. The chip-level design of EWOD chips allows for the integration electrode addressing and wire routing, thus helping cope with the increasing complexity of biochemical assays. Furthermore, high-frequency EWODs also facilitate finishing time-sensitive bioassays such as incubation and emerging flash chemistry in specific time periods. However, the reliability of the EWOD chip is reduced by the contact angle change reduction problem as a result of the repeated and frequent switching of electrodes. Thus, the chip-level design of EWOD chips should consider reliability, electrode addressing, and the wire routing problem. This paper presents a graph-based chip-level design algorithm. By setting the switching-time constraint, the number of switching times can be limited to minimize the impact of the contact angle change reductions problem. Also, a progressive addressing and routing approach is proposed to overcome the complex wire routing problem. Experimental results show the proposed algorithm effectively minimizes the impact of the contact angle change reduction problem, thus providing a reliable chip-level design with a feasible wire routing solution with the required number of pins.},

However, most acoustic devices are passive components, and dynamic control of acoustic waves in a low-loss and scalable manner remains an outstanding challenge, which hinders the development of phononic integrated circuits. Here we demonstrate electrical control of traveling acoustic waves on an integrated lithium niobate platform at both room and millikelvin temperatures. We modulate the phase and amplitude of the acoustic waves and demonstrate an acoustic frequency shifter by serrodyne phase modulation. Furthermore, we show reconfigurable nonreciprocal modulation by tailoring the phase matching between acoustic and quasi-traveling electric fields. Our scalable electro-acoustic platform comprises the fundamental elements for arbitrary acoustic signal processing and manipulation of phononic quantum information.},

The findings of this water quality assessment, based on data collected between September and October 2012, indicated that a majority of the lakes were classified as Class II (Clean) waters suitable for recreational use. The results of the trophic state assessments, however, indicated that all of the lakes were eutrophic, meaning they were nutrient-rich, they could experience algae blooms or macrophyte problems, and they were likely to exhibit poor water quality. Sustainable management measures and strategies are suggested to address the eutrophication problems of Malaysian lakes and reservoirs, with the national responses on lake and reservoir management also being discussed.},

  abstract = {Salmonella is one of the main causes of foodborne infectious diseases, posing a serious threat to public health. It can enter the food supply chain at various stages of production, processing, distribution, and marketing. High prevalence of Salmonella necessitates efficient and effective approaches for its identification, detection, and monitoring at an early stage. Because conventional methods based on plate counting and real-time polymerase chain reaction are timeconsuming and laborious, novel rapid detection methods are urgently needed for in-field and on-line applications. Biosensors provide many advantages over conventional laboratory assays in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, and show superiority in rapid response and potential portability. They are now recognized as promising alternative tools and one of the most on-site applicable and end user–accessible methods for rapid detection. In recent years, we have witnessed a flourishing of studies in the development of robust and elaborate biosensors for detection of Salmonella in food. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview on Salmonella biosensors by highlighting different signal-transducing mechanisms (optical, electrochemical, piezoelectric, etc.) and critically analyzing its recent trends, particularly in combination with nanomaterials, microfluidics, portable instruments, and smartphones. Furthermore, current challenges are emphasized and future perspectives are discussed.},

  abstract = {NH3 production is dependent on the century-old Haber-Bosch process, which is energy and capital intensive and relies on H2 from steam reforming, hence, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Electrochemical NH3 synthesis can be realized by reaction of N2 and a proton source under mild conditions powered by renewable electricity, which offers a promising carbon-neutral and sustainable strategy. However, N2 has remarkable thermodynamic stability and requires high energy to be activated. Implementation of this ‘‘clean’’ NH3 synthesis route therefore still requires significant enhancement in energy efficiency, conversion rate, and durability, which is only achievable through the design of efficient electrocatalysts. This article provides a timely theoretical and experimental overview of recent advances in the electrocatalytic conversion of N2 to NH3 underlining the development of novel electrocatalysts. Advances of in situ and operando studies for mechanistic understanding of the reaction and the main challenges and strategies for improving electrocatalytic N2 reduction are highlighted.},

According to pharmacopeia requirements, sub-visible particle levels need to be controlled throughout the shelf life of the product. Therefore, in addition to determining the particle counts, it is crucial to accurately characterize the particles in a drug product to understand the stress condition of exposure and make appropriate mitigation actions for specific formulations. In this study, we developed a new method for intelligently characterizing the protein particles by micro-Raman spectroscopy on a digital microfluidic chip (DMF). Microliters of stress degradation-induced protein particle solutions were loaded onto the DMF chip, and multiple droplets were generated and used for Raman spectroscopy testing. Multiple machine learning classification models were trained by Raman spectra of the obtained protein particles, and the eight protein particles were successfully characterized and predicted with high classification accuracy (93\% - 100\%). The advantages of the proposed novel particle characterization method include a closed system to prevent particle contamination, one-stop testing of morphological and chemical structure information, low sample volume consumption, reusable particle droplets, and simplified data analysis and high classification accuracy. It provides great potential to determine the probable root cause of particle sources or stress conditions based on a single assay to develop an accurate particle control strategies that ultimately extend the product shelf-life.},

The localization of our prepared nanoprobes in specific organelles was confirmed by super-high resolution fluorescence imaging and bio-transmission electron microscopy (TEM) methods. By the targeting ability, the pH values of the specific organelles can be determined by monitoring the vibrational spectral changes of MPy with different pH values. Compared to the cases of reported lysosome and cytoplasm SERS pH sensors, more accurate pH values of mitochondria and nucleus, which could be two additional intracellular tracers for subcellular microenvironments, were disclosed by this SERS approach, further improving the accuracy of discrimination of related diseases. Our sensitive SERS strategy can also be employed to explore crucial physiological and biological processes that are related to subcellular pH fluctuations.},

  abstract = {In recent years, point-of-care testing has played an important role in immunoassay, biochemical analysis, and molecular diagnosis, especially in low-resource settings. Among various point-of-care-testing platforms, microfluidic chips have many outstanding advantages. Microfluidic chip applies the technology of miniaturizing conventional laboratory which enables the whole biochemical process including reagent loading, reaction, separation, and detection on the microchip. As a result, microfluidic platform has become a hotspot of research in the fields of food safety, health care, and environmental monitoring in the past few decades. Here, the state-of-the-art application of microfluidics in immunoassay in the past decade will be reviewed. According to different driving forces of fluid, microfluidic platform is divided into two parts: passive manipulation and active manipulation. In passive manipulation, we focus on the capillary-driven microfluidics, while in active manipulation, we introduce pressure microfluidics, centrifugal microfluidics, electric microfluidics, optofluidics, magnetic microfluidics, and digital microfluidics. Additionally, within the introduction of each platform, innovation of the methods used and their corresponding performance improvement will be discussed. Ultimately, the shortcomings of different platforms and approaches for improvement will be proposed.},

In particular, we demonstrate increased efficiency and speed in carrying out particle concentration/separation and in generating intense micromixing in microliter drops within which acoustic streaming is induced due to the focused SAW beneath the drop. Concentric circular and elliptical single-phase unidirectional transducers (SPUDTs) were used to focus the SAW. We benchmark our results against a straight SPUDT which does not cause focusing of the SAW. Due to the increased wave intensity and asymmetry of the wave, we found both circular and elliptical SPUDTs concentrate particles in under 1 s, which is one order of magnitude faster than the straight SPUDT and several orders of magnitude faster than conventional microscale devices. The concentric circular SPUDT was found to be most effective at a given input power since it generated the largest azimuthal velocity gradient within the fluid to drive particle shear migration. On the other hand, the concentric elliptical SPUDT generated the highest micromixing intensity due to the more narrowly focused SAW radiation that substantially enhances acoustic streaming in the fluid.},

  abstract = {This paper reports on a technique that significantly improves the performance of open-plate electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) devices by using chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) to achieve surface planarization. In EWOD devices, trenches are inevitably generated during fabrication, and these can have a considerable effect on droplet manipulation. Such artefacts lead to a local intensification in the electric field that not only hinders the droplet movement due to a partially increased adhesion force, but also limits the maximum applicable potential by increasing the likelihood of a dielectric breakdown. We conducted theoretical and experimental studies on the effect of trenches on the performance of both unpolished and polished EWOD devices. Various combinations of the droplet volume and electrode size were tested, and our proposed technique resulted in a notable improvement for all cases. For instance, when operating at 100 V, a 3.5 μL droplet could be translated at 70 mm/s on the polished EWOD device, which is twice as fast as that for its unpolished counterpart at the same voltage. Also, the maximum applicable potential resulting in a dielectric breakdown of the polished EWOD device was measured to be 27\% higher than that of a conventional device.},

The use of Digital Microfluidics Biochips (DMFBs) in disease assessment and recognition of target molecules had become popular during the past few years. The reliability of these DMFBs is crucial when they are used in various medical applications. Errors found in these biochips are mainly due to the defects developed during droplet manipulation, chip degradation and inaccuracies in the bio-assay experiments. The recently proposed Micro-electrode-dot Array (MEDA)-based DMFBs involve both fluidic and electronic domains in the micro-electrode cell. Thus, the testing techniques for these biochips should be revised in order to ensure proper functionality. This paper describes recent advances in the testing technologies for digital microfluidics biochips, which would serve as a useful platform for developing revised/new testing techniques for MEDA-based biochips. Therefore, the relevancy of these techniques with respect to testing of MEDA-based biochips is analyzed in order to exploit the full potential of these biochips.},

To mitigate these issues, a number of different biosensors have been developed, including lateral flow assays (LFAs), which have emerged as valuable tools in pathogen detection due to their portability, ease of use, time efficiency, and cost effectiveness. The performance of LFAs has been considerably enhanced by the development of new nanomaterials over the years.

  abstract = {The miniaturization of laboratory procedures for Lab-on-Chip (LoC) devices and translation to various platforms such as single cell analysis or Organ-on-Chip (OoC) systems are revolutionizing the life sciences and biomedical fields. As a result, microfluidics is becoming a viable technology for improving the quality and sensitivity of critical processes. Yet, standard test methods have not yet been established to validate basic manufacturing steps, performance, and safety of microfluidic devices. The successful development and widespread use of microfluidic technologies are greatly dependent on the community’s success in establishing widely supported test protocols. A key area that requires consensus guidelines is leakage testing. There are unique challenges in preventing and detecting leaks in microfluidic systems because of their small dimensions, high surface-area to volume ratios, low flow rates, limited volumes, and relatively high-pressure differentials over short distances. Also, microfluidic devices often employ heterogenous components, including unique connectors and fluid-contacting materials, which potentially make them more susceptible to mechanical integrity failures. The differences between microfluidic systems and traditional macroscale technologies can exacerbate the impact of a leak on the performance and safety on the microscale. To support the microfluidics community efforts in product development and commercialization, it is critical to identify common aspects of leakage in microfluidic devices and standardize the corresponding safety and performance metrics. There is a need for quantitative metrics to provide quality assurance during or after the manufacturing process. It is also necessary to implement application-specific test methods to effectively characterize leakage in microfluidic systems. In this review, different methods for assessing microfluidics leaks, the benefits of using different test media and materials, and the utility of leakage testing throughout the product life cycle are discussed. Current leakage testing protocols and standard test methods that can be leveraged for characterizing leaks in microfluidic devices and potential classification strategies are also discussed. We hope that this review article will stimulate more discussions around the development of gas and liquid leakage test standards in academia and industry to facilitate device commercialization in the emerging field of microfluidics.},

It is used for analysis of different biological samples like protein, sirum etc using an array of electrically controlled electrodes. This paper deals with a challenging problem related to the design of DMFB. Specifically the design problem considered is related to high performance droplet routing, where each droplet has single source location and single target location. The objectives are (i) minimizing the number of electrodes used in the DMFB, and (ii) minimizing total routing timellatest arrival time of all the droplet at their target locations. We propose a simple algorithm for concurrent path allocation to multiple droplets, based on the classical shortest-path algorithm, together with the use of stalling, and possible detouring of droplets in cases of contentions. The algorithm is also extended to droplet routing where a droplet may have two source positions and a single target position. The algorithm is implemented on a Linux platform and empirical results are quite encouraging.},

  abstract = {This article draws attention to monitoring water-based diseases of human beings and other aquatic animals caused by a high level of ammonia present in water. A flexible sensor for measuring the level of ammonia in water or aqueous solution has been fabricated and tested. Most of the conventional sensors are either not stable or suitable for the measurement of underwater ammonia. Because of this, we intend to make a modest attempt to propose a low-cost, foldable, stable, and reliable Copper oxide (CuO) nanowire electrode-based ammonia sensitive extended gate field-effect transistor (EG-FET). In this article, CuO nanowire has been synthesized at low temperatures for realizing an extended gate for field-effecttransistor (FET). The device has been characterized for aqueous ammonia sensing at different levels of concentrations of ammonia. The sensor exhibits very high linearity [{$>$} 99\%] along with high sensitivity ({$>$}65 [mV]/[mg/L] and 1.62 𝝁𝑨𝟏/𝟐 / [mg/L]). The sensor performance has also been studied under the bending condition showing an excellent sensing performance and linearity without any performance degradation. The various characterizations have been done to validate the crystalline, uniform, and dense formation of CuO nanowires using a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM) and tunnel microscope TEM. The device is well suited to measure the NH3 content (from 1.5 mg/L (or ppm) to 7.5 mg/L) in an aqueous solution.},

  abstract = {Purpose: New therapies for lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) have generated interest in screening newborns for these conditions. We present performance validation data on a digital microfluidic platform that performs multiplex enzymatic assays for Pompe, Fabry, Hunter, Gaucher, and Hurler diseases. Methods: We developed an investigational disposable digital microfluidic cartridge that uses a single dried blood spot (DBS) punch for performing a 5-plex fluorometric enzymatic assay on up to 44 DBS samples. Precision and linearity of the assays were determined by analyzing quality control DBS samples; clinical performance was determined by analyzing 600 presumed normal and known affected samples (12 for Pompe, 7 for Fabry and 10 each for Hunter, Gaucher and Hurler). Results: Overall coefficient of variation (CV) values between cartridges, days, instruments, and operators ranged from 2 to 21\%; linearity correlation coefficients were ≥ 0.98 for all assays. The multiplex enzymatic assay performed from a single DBS punch was able to discriminate presumed normal from known affected samples for 5 LSDs. Conclusions: Digital microfluidic technology shows potential for rapid, high-throughput screening for 5 LSDs in a newborn screening laboratory environment. Sample preparation to enzymatic activity on each cartridge is less than 3 h.},

  abstract = {The study was to determine the concentration of aluminium (Al) and study the physicochemical parameters (pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), turbidity, and residual chlorine) in drinking water supply in selected palm oil estates in Kota Tinggi, Johor. Water samples were collected from the estates with the private and the public water supplies. The sampling points were at the water source (S), the treatment plant outlet (TPO), and at the nearest houses (H1) and the furthest houses (H2) from the TPO. All estates with private water supply failed to meet the NSDWQ for Al with mean concentration of 0.99 ± 1.52\,mg/L. However, Al concentrations in all public water supply estates were well within the limit except for one estate. The pH for all samples complied with the NSDWQ except from the private estates for the drinking water supply with an acidic pH (5.50 ± 0.90). The private water supply showed violated turbidity value in the drinking water samples (14.2 ± 24.1 NTU). Insufficient amount of chlorination was observed in the private water supply estates (0.09 ± 0.30\,mg/L). Private water supplies with inefficient water treatment served unsatisfactory drinking water quality to the community which may lead to major health problems.},

  abstract = {The design of novel food micro-structures aimed at the quality, health and pleasure markets will probably require unit operations where the scale of the forming device is closer to the size of the structural elements (i.e., 1–100 μm). One emerging possibility is microfluidics or devices that employ small amounts of fluids (10−6 to 10−9 l) flowing in channels where at least one dimension is less than 1 mm. However, under these conditions, the predominant effects are not necessarily those present in conventional macroscopic unit operations. Dominant physical effects at the microfluidic scale are introduced through the use of dimensionless numbers. Different types of geometries to generate multi-phase flows in micro-channels, techniques and materials to construct the micro-devices, principally soft lithography and laser ablation, as well as methods used to modify surface properties of channels, are reviewed. The operation of micro-devices, the role of flow regimes, rheological behaviour of fluids in micro-channels and of transient time is discussed. Finally, systems developed to generate emulsions and foams, fluid mixing and dispersion, and future applications of these devices in food processing and food analysis are presented.},

  abstract = {The current practice of designing microfluidic Lab-on-a-Chip (LoCs) limits reusing designs and makes sharing tasks among researchers difficult. One way to achieve that objective is to borrow best practices from engineering. Also it takes a lot of skills to design LoCs. Design-by-assembly in which a LoC can be designed by configuring, laying out subsystems can help new researchers to develop custom chips. Flexible, reusable, and rapid-prototyping-feasible LoC designs can be achieved by fabricated modular microfluidic blocks. However, challenging problems still persist, which limit the usefulness of prefabricated blocks. We propose software microfluidic modules (SoftMABs) based design technique to solve issues fabricated modules face. By configuring SoftMABs, integrating them, the new assembly of SoftMABs can form a 3D LoC design ready to be prototyped. The proposed method can make designing a complex LoC less challenging, and collaborating among laboratories easier. We created SoftMABs and designed a custom microfluidic chip by assembling SoftMABs like LEGOs, dragging-and-dropping them. Later we reconfigured them - by replacing a SoftMAB with another module - to make a new LoC. We believe this computeraided method is an interesting and useful LoC design technique.},

Crossreference scheme, which allows single-layer electrode fabrication for 2D droplet movement consist of both top and bottom substrate each consist of orthogonally aligned parallel electrode assembly in the XY-plane. The present work focuses on simulation of driving force in the cross-reference design using 3D voltage distribution plots obtained through AC-DC module of COMSOL Multiphysics software. The cross-reference scheme is not only easy to fabricate but also does not compromise with system performance as in the case of classical scheme due to large electrode gap. For simulation, a 3 x 3 array of electrode has been considered for 2D droplet motion by actuating inner electrodes. Voltage distribution across different layers has been calculated from field distribution plot and used in energy based model for estimating actuation force during droplet transition.},

Electrodes are diagonally connected with one external pin to the voltage supply. Each electrode‐pad is made by carving (or cutting) out two triangular sections from the sides and adding two triangular sections on the top and bottom of the traditional square electrode. This modification in electrode shape creates an imbalance of electromechanical force at the three‐phase contact line on applying the supply voltage to the actuating electrode. Droplet moves towards either horizontal or vertical directions depending on the direction of the dominant force. The scheme requires a single layer of metal thin film deposition for device fabrication and also reduces the number of external pin connections to the power supply.},

The EWOD device is fabricated on glass substrate with aluminimum (Al) electrode. Next, synthesized nanocomposite thin film of BST/Teflon® AF is coated on the coplanar electrodes to act as both dielectric and hydrophobic layer. Experiments show that change in electrode dimension (or shape), such as electrode length (L), gap (G) and no. of teeth (T) result different contact line (CL) between the droplet and the actuated electrode. This leads to change in VT for droplet transport. It is found that higher contact line results in lower threshold voltage, while lower contact line results in higher threshold voltage.

The physico-chemical nature of interfaces between two immiscible aqueous phases leads to unique interfacial properties, such as an ultra-low interfacial tension. Strategies to manipulate components and direct their assembly at these interfaces needs to be explored. In this paper, we review progress on the topic over the past few years, with a focus on the fabrication and stabilization of all-aqueous structures in a multiphase microfluidic platform.

  abstract = {Nanozymes are synthetic nanoparticulate materials that mimic the biological activities of enzymes by virtue of their surface chemistry. Enzymes catalyze biological reactions with a very high degree of specificity. Examples include the horseradish peroxidase, lactate, glucose, and cholesterol oxidases. For this reason, many industrial uses of enzymes outside their natural environments have been developed. Similar to enzymes, many industrial applications of nanozymes have been developed and used. Unlike the enzymes, however, nanozymes are cost-effectively prepared, purified, stored, and reproducibly and repeatedly used for long periods of time. The detection and identification of pathogens is among some of the reported applications of nanozymes. Three of the methodologic milestones in the evolution of pathogen detection and identification include the incubation and growth, immunoassays and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) strategies. Although advances in the history of pathogen detection and identification have given rise to novel methods and devices, these are still short of the response speed, accuracy and cost required for point-of-care use. Debuting recently, nanozymology offers significant improvements in the six methodological indicators that are proposed as being key in this review, including simplicity, sensitivity, speed of response, cost, reliability, and durability of the immunoassays and PCR strategies. This review will focus on the applications of nanozymes in the detection and identification of pathogens in samples obtained from foods, natural, and clinical sources. It will highlight the impact of nanozymes in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent and PCR strategies by discussing the mechanistic improvements and the role of the design and architecture of the nanozyme nanoconjugates. Because of their contribution to world health burden, the three most important pathogens that will be considered include viruses, bacteria and fungi. Although not quite seen as pathogens, the review will also consider the detection of cancer cells and helminth parasites. The review leaves very little doubt that nanozymology has introduced remarkable advances in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and PCR strategies for detecting these five classes of pathogens. However, a gap still exists in the application of nanozymes to detect and identify fungal pathogens directly, although indirect strategies in which nanozymes are used have been reported. From a mechanistic point of view, the nanozyme technology transfer to laboratory research methods in PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay studies, and the point-of-care devices such as electronic biosensors and lateral flow detection strips, that is currently taking place, is most likely to give rise to no small revolution in each of the six methodological indicators for pathogen detection and identification. While the evidence of widespread research reports, clinical trials and point-of-care device patents support this view, the gaps that still exist point to a need for more basic research studies to be conducted on the applications of nanozymology in pathogen detection and identification. The multidisciplinary nature of the research on the application of nanozymes in the detection and identification of pathogens requires chemists and physicists for the design, fabrication, and characterization of nanozymes; microbiologists for the design, testing and analysis of the methodologies, and clinicians or clinical researchers for the evaluation of the methodologies and devices in the clinic. Many reports have also implicated required skills in mathematical modelling, and electronic engineering. While the review will conclude with a synopsis of the impact of nanozymology on the detection and identification of viruses, bacteria, fungi, cancer cells, and helminths, it will also point out opportunities that exist in basic research as well as opportunities for innovation aimed at novel laboratory methodologies and devices. In this regard there is no doubt that there are numerous unexplored research areas in the application of nanozymes for the detection of pathogens. For example, most research on the applications of nanozymes for the detection and identification of fungi is so far limited only to the detection of mycotoxins and other chemical compounds associated with fungal infection. Therefore, there is scope for exploration of the application of nanozymes in the direct detection of fungi in foods, especially in the agricultural production thereof. Many fungal species found in seeds severely compromise their use by inactivating the germination thereof. Fungi also produce mycotoxins that can severely compromise the health of humans if consumed.},

The fabrication technique using laser direct etching (LDE) on ITO glass has the advantages of being rapid, low cost and convenient. However, the fabrication resolution of LDE limits the minimum line width for patterns on ITO glasses, leading to a related wider lead wire for the actuating electrodes of DMF compared with photolithography. Therefore, the lead wire of electrodes could affect the droplet motion on the digital microfluidic chip due to the increased contact line with the droplet. Herein, we developed a finite element model of a DMF with improved efficiency to investigate the effect of the lead wire. An optimized electrode pattern was then designed based on a theoretical analysis and validated by a simulation, which significantly decreased the deformation of the droplets down to 0.012 mm. The performance of the optimized electrode was also verified in an experiment. The proposed simulation method could be further extended to other DMF systems or applications to provide an efficient approach for the design and optimization of DMF chips.},

Graphene, with a unique 2-D nanostructure, has been extensively studied as a supercapacitor material with superior charge storage capability. Recently, the progress in thin-film fabrication technologies has facilitated the development of graphene-based MSCs, which results in device miniaturization and improved areal capacitance.

  abstract = {In order to fabricate a digital microfluidic (DMF) chip, which requires a patterned array of electrodes coated with a dielectric film, we explored two simple methods: Ballpoint pen printing to generate the electrodes, and wrapping of a dielectric plastic film to coat the electrodes. For precise and programmable printing of the patterned electrodes, we used a digital plotter with a ballpoint pen filled with a silver nanoparticle (AgNP) ink. Instead of using conventional material deposition methods, such as chemical vapor deposition, printing, and spin coating, for fabricating the thin dielectric layer, we used a simple method in which we prepared a thin dielectric layer using pre-made linear, low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) plastic (17-µm thick) by simple wrapping. We then sealed it tightly with thin silicone oil layers so that it could be used as a DMF chip. Such a treated dielectric layer showed good electrowetting performance for a sessile drop without contact angle hysteresis under an applied voltage of less than 170 V. By using this straightforward fabrication method, we quickly and affordably fabricated a paper-based DMF chip and demonstrated the digital electrofluidic actuation and manipulation of drops.},

Programmable paper-based microfluidic devices enable a wide range of biomarker detection with high sensitivity and automation for single- and multi-step assays because they provide better control for manipulating fluid samples. In this review, we examine the advances in programmable microfluidics, i.e., paper-based continuous-flow microfluidic (p-CMF) devices and paper-based digital microfluidic (p-DMF) devices, for biomarker detection. First, we discuss the methods used to fabricate these two types of paper-based microfluidic devices and the strategies for programming fluid delivery and for droplet manipulation. Next, we discuss the use of these programmable paper-based devices for the single- and multi-step detection of biomarkers. Finally, we present the current limitations of paper-based microfluidics for biomarker detection and the outlook for their development.},

While conventional methods often require complicated workflows, costly reagents, lab equipment, and are time‐consuming, rendering them inadequate for field~testing and low‐resource settings. Increased attention has been drawn to developing alternative low‐cost and rapid methods to detect on‐site live pathogens in different environmental matrices. Among them, microfluidic devices that integrate various laboratory functions in a miniaturized manner have proven to be a promising tool for the rapid and sensitive detection of pathogens. Herein, the development of microfluidic devices specifically designed for the detection of live pathogens is discussed along a concise summary of novel microfluidics~systems recently developed, contrasted to conventional methods regarding assay time, the limit of detection, and target organisms. These include a variety of micro total analysis systems (µTAS) and microfluidic paper‐based analytical devices (µPADs) in combination with molecular methods and traditional live cell detection techniques, such as cell culture, DNA intercalating dyes, resazurin, and immobilized bioreceptors (e.g., aptamers and capture antibodies). Furthermore, insights on the future perspectives of microfluidics for live pathogen detection with a highlight on the rapid and low‐cost method development for field testing are provided.},

Although the effectiveness of this technique has been widely demonstrated for applications based on micrometer-sized particles, the manipulation and focusing of sub-micrometer ones is challenging due to the presence of acoustic streaming.~In this article, our study has the aim to investigate and understand which geometrical parameters could be changed to limit the acoustic streaming effect. We numerically study the well-known rectangular cross section of a microfluidic channel and perform a parametric study of the aspect ratio for several particle sizes. The efficiency of the focusing, is explored for different sized particles in order to identify a trend for which the acoustic streaming does not drastically influence the focusing motion of the particles. The possibility to efficiently separate different solid components in liquid suspensions, i.e. the whole blood, is crucial for all applications that require a purified medium such as plasmapheresis or an increase of the concentration of specific subpopulation as the outcome, such as proteomics, cancer biomarker detections and extracellular vesicles separation.},

  abstract = {The significance of microfluidics-based and microelectromechanical systems–based biosensors has been widely acknowledged, and many reviews have explored their potential applications in clinical diagnostics, personalized medicine, global health, drug discovery, food safety, and forensics. Because health care costs are increasing, there is an increasing need to remotely monitor the health condition of patients by point-of-care-testing. The demand for biosensors for detection of biological warfare agents has increased, and research is focused on ways of producing small portable devices that would allow fast, accurate, and on-site detection. In the past decade, the demand for rapid and accurate on-site detection of plant disease diagnosis has increased due to emerging pathogens with resistance to pesticides, increased human mobility, and regulations limiting the application of toxic chemicals to prevent spread of diseases. The portability of biosensors for onsite diagnosis is limited due to various issues, including sample preparation techniques, fluid-handling techniques, the limited lifetime of biological reagents, device packaging, integrating electronics for data collection/analysis, and the requirement of external accessories and power. Many microfluidic, electronic, and biological design strategies, such as handling liquids in biosensors without pumps/valves, the application of droplet-based microfluidics, paper-based microfluidic devices, and wireless networking capabilities for data transmission, are being explored.},

  abstract = {In order to shorten the required time for the analysis of medical substances, Digital Microfluidic Biochips (DMFBs) have been suggested. They allow for handling small amounts of samples and reagents on a circuit board and, thus, automatically execute medical experiments that are usually conducted manually in laboratories. However, there are various challenges in the design of DMFBs. Issues such as routing and layouting are complex and currently being investigated by various researchers and engineers. Although first automatic solutions assist them, the obtained results are usually provided in a complex and non-intuitive fashion. This makes the utilization and evaluation of existing approaches for DMFB design a tedious task. In this paper, we present a solution for this problem by proposing a visualization scheme for DMFBs that explicitly addresses these problems. To this end, a grammar is proposed which allows the description of resulting designs and their properties. The contributions of this work allow for a design methodology which is easy to use and provides a hassle-free environment for the involved researchers and engineers.},

We present a poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) microdevice where on-board infrared-mediated PCR amplification is seamlessly integrated with a particle-based, visual DNA detection for specific detection of bacterial targets in less than 35 minutes. Fluidic control is achieved using a capillary burst valve laser-ablated in a novel manner to confine the PCR reagents to a chamber during thermal cycling, and a manual torque-actuated pressure system to mobilize the fluid from the PCR chamber to the detection reservoir containing oligonucleotide-adducted magnetic particles. Interaction of amplified products specific to the target organism with the beads in a rotating magnetic field allows for near instantaneous ({$<$}30 s) detection based on hybridization-induced aggregation (HIA) of the particles and simple optical analysis. The integration of PCR with this rapid, sequence-specific DNA detection method on a single microdevice presents the possibility of creating POC NAT systems that are low cost, easy-to-use, and involve minimal external hardware.},

  abstract = {Review on miniaturization, integration, and automation of laboratory processes within centrifugal microfluidic platforms. For efficient implementation of applications, building blocks are categorized into unit operations and process chains.           ,              Centrifugal microfluidics has evolved into a mature technology. Several major diagnostic companies either have products on the market or are currently evaluating centrifugal microfluidics for product development. The fields of application are widespread and include clinical chemistry, immunodiagnostics and protein analysis, cell handling, molecular diagnostics, as well as food, water, and soil analysis. Nevertheless, new fluidic functions and applications that expand the possibilities of centrifugal microfluidics are being introduced at a high pace. In this review, we first present an up-to-date comprehensive overview of centrifugal microfluidic unit operations. Then, we introduce the term “process chain” to review how these unit operations can be combined for the automation of laboratory workflows. Such aggregation of basic functionalities enables efficient fluidic design at a higher level of integration. Furthermore, we analyze how novel, ground-breaking unit operations may foster the integration of more complex applications. Among these are the storage of pneumatic energy to realize complex switching sequences or to pump liquids radially inward, as well as the complete pre-storage and release of reagents. In this context, centrifugal microfluidics provides major advantages over other microfluidic actuation principles: the pulse-free inertial liquid propulsion provided by centrifugal microfluidics allows for closed fluidic systems that are free of any interfaces to external pumps. Processed volumes are easily scalable from nanoliters to milliliters. Volume forces can be adjusted by rotation and thus, even for very small volumes, surface forces may easily be overcome in the centrifugal gravity field which enables the efficient separation of nanoliter volumes from channels, chambers or sensor matrixes as well as the removal of any disturbing bubbles. In summary, centrifugal microfluidics takes advantage of a comprehensive set of fluidic unit operations such as liquid transport, metering, mixing and valving. The available unit operations cover the entire range of automated liquid handling requirements and enable efficient miniaturization, parallelization, and integration of assays.},

Current techniques for full-custom design of droplet-based “digital” biochips do not scale well for concurrent assays and for next-generation system-on-chip (SOC) designs that are expected to include microfluidic components. We propose a system design methodology that attempts to apply classical high-level synthesis techniques to the design of digital microfluidic biochips. We focus here on the problem of scheduling bioassay functions under resource constraints. We first develop an optimal scheduling strategy based on integer linear programming. However, because the scheduling problem is NP-complete, we also develop two heuristic techniques that scale well for large problem instances. A clinical diagnostic procedure, namely multiplexed in-vitro diagnostics on human physiological fluids, is first used to illustrate and evaluate the proposed method. Next, the synthesis approach is applied to a protein assay, which serves as a more complex bioassay application. The proposed synthesis approach is expected to reduce human effort and design cycle time, and it will facilitate the integration of microfluidic components with microelectronic components in next-generation SOCs.},

  abstract = {Microfluidics-based biochips are soon expected to revolutionize clinical diagnosis, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing, and other laboratory procedures involving molecular biology. In contrast to continuous-flow systems that rely on permanently etched microchannels, micropumps, and microvalves, digital microfluidics offers a scalable system architecture and dynamic reconfigurability; groups of unit cells in a microfluidics array can be reconfigured to change their functionality during the concurrent execution of a set of bioassays. As more bioassays are executed concurrently on a biochip, system integration and design complexity are expected to increase dramatically. This paper presents an overview of an integrated system-level design methodology that attempts to address key issues in the synthesis, testing and reconfiguration of digital microfluidics-based biochips. Different actuation mechanisms for microfluidics-based biochips, and associated design-automation trends and challenges are also discussed. The proposed top-down design-automation approach is expected to relieve biochip users from the burden of manual optimization of bioassays, time-consuming hardware design, and costly testing and maintenance procedures, and it will facilitate the integration of fluidic components with a microelectronic component in next-generation systems-on-chips (SOCs).},

  abstract = {We report a digital microfluidic device to transport aqueous droplets on an open surface in air using electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) with anisotropic ratchet conveyors (ARCs). ARCs are micro-sized periodic semicircular hydrophilic regions on a hydrophobic background, providing anisotropic wettability. SiNx and Cytop are used as the dielectric layer between the water droplet and working electrodes. By adopting parylene as a stencil mask, hydrophilic patterning on the hydrophobic Cytop thin film layer is achieved without the loss of Cytop hydrophobicity. While the traditional EWOD platform requires the control of multiple electrodes to transport the droplet, our system utilizes only two controlling electrodes. We demonstrate that 15 ll water droplets are transported at a speed of 13 mm/s under 60 Vpeak sinusoid AC signal at 50 Hz. Droplet transport at 20 Hz is also presented, demonstrating that the system can operate within a range of frequencies.},

They can move easily across either solid or liquid surfaces since the hydrophobic particles protect the internal liquid from contacting the substrate. In recent years, mainly due to their simple preparation, abundant materials, non-wetting/non-adhesive properties, elasticities and stabilities, LMs have been applied in many fields such as microfluidics, sensors and biological incubators. In this review, the recent advances in the preparation, physical properties and applications of liquid marbles, especially operations and floating abilities, are summarized. Moreover, the challenges to achieve uniformity, slow volatilization and stronger stability are pointed out. Various applications generated by LMs’ structural characteristics are also expected.},

  abstract = {Food poisoning and infectious diseases caused by Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium) are serious public health concerns for human health and food safety. The diversity and complexity of food matrices pose great challenges for rapid and ultra-sensitive detection of S. typhimurium in food samples. A method capable of identification, detection, and quantification of S. typhimurium is essential for addressing these issues. In this study, aptamer-coated magnetic beads (Apt-MBs) are employed as capture bio-probes to specifically and selectively concentrate S. typhimurium in food samples. A self-priming chip-based digital PCR was then presented as another biosensor for on-site detection and quantification of S. typhimurium cells. The chip we developed was robust and did not require any external power for sample loading. The combination of Apt-MBs with an on-chip digital detection realized the integration into lab-on-a-chip-based biosensors for on-site monitoring of foodborne pathogens. It was possible to capture and detect S. typhimurium cells as low as 90 CFU/reaction with a capture efficiency of 94.5\%. Additionally, the whole process only took about 2 h. This unique platform could also be used to monitor other target bacteria with high specificity and sensitivity by utilizing different aptamers. Furthermore, the platform has potential applications in point-of-care testing in the future.},

These factors show that electrowetting technology is a strong alternative to electrophoretic technique which enables reflective displays available to the e-reader market. This technology offers advantages of insensitivity to cellgap variations and thus can be used to create electronic paper with excellent video capability at low cost.

  abstract = {In aquaculture industry, fish, shellfish, and aquatic plants are cultivated in fresh, salt, or brackish waters. The increasing demand of aquatic products has stimulated the rapid growth of aquaculture industries. How to effectively monitor and control water quality is one of the key concerns for aquaculture industry to ensure high productivity and high quality. There are four major categories of water quality concerns that affect aquaculture cultivations, namely, (1) physical parameters, e.g., pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and salinity, (2) organic contaminants, (3) biochemical hazards, e.g., cyanotoxins, and (4) biological contaminants, i.e., pathogens. While the physical parameters are affected by climate changes, the latter three are considered as environmental factors. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of sensors, biosensors, and analytical technologies available for monitoring aquaculture water quality. They include low-cost commercial sensors and sensor network setups for physical parameters. They also include chromatography, mass spectrometry, biochemistry, and molecular methods (e.g., immunoassays and polymerase chain reaction assays), culture-based method, and biophysical technologies (e.g., biosensors and nanosensors) for environmental contamination factors. According to the different levels of sophistication of various analytical techniques and the information they can provide (either fine fingerprint, highly accurate quantification, semiquantification, qualitative detection, or fast screening), we will comment on how they may be used as complementary tools, as well as their potential and gaps toward current demand of real-time, online, and/or onsite detection.},

  abstract = {Ion-selective electrode (ISE) membranes with a solid contact rather than a traditional liquid inner contact are anticipated to give lower detection limits because of diminished ion fluxes. Often, however, ill-defined solid contacts give rise to instabilities and interferences by oxygen gas. Here, a poly(methyl methacrylate)/poly(decyl methacrylate) (MMA/DMA) copolymer as membrane matrix was solvent-cast on a layer of poly(n-octyl)thiophene (POT) deposited on Au as internal contact. The resulting Ca2+- and Pb2+-selective electrodes were not sensitive to O2 and no evidence was found for the presence of a water film between membrane and internal contact. On the other hand, a water film was present when electropolymerized poly(n-octyl)thiophene was used. In the absence of a conducting polymer, O2 induced a significant change in the EMF but no clear evidence was found for a water film between POT and the MMA/DMA membrane. The lower detection limit of the new Au-POT-MMA/DMA solid-contact electrodes was somewhat better than that observed with a corresponding liquid-contact ISE and reached subnanomolar levels. Importantly, the response times for the solid-contact ISE are, at low concentrations, much faster than for the liquid-contact ISE.},

Various magnetic forces have been employed for the migration, orientation, manipulation, and trapping of microparticles, and new analytical platforms for separating and detecting molecules have been proposed. Magnetic materials such as functional magnetic nanoparticles, magnetic nanocomposites, and specially designed magnetic solids and liquids have also been developed for analytical purposes. Numerous attractive applications of magnetic and electromagnetic forces on magnetic and non-magnetic materials have been studied, but fundamental studies to understand the working principles of magnetic forces have been challenging. These studies will form a new field of magneto-analytical science, which should be developed as an interdisciplinary field.

  abstract = {In digital microfluidics, discrete droplets of fluid are made to move on an open surface with no microchannels. These systems are commonly operated by application of electrical driving forces to an array of electrodes. While these driving forces are well characterized, the dissipative forces opposing droplet movement have not been as thoroughly examined. In recognition of this deficit, we used force− velocity plots to characterize droplet movement in digital microfluidics, which was found to be consistent with a simple theoretical framework for understanding dissipation effects for droplets in two-plate, air-filled devices. Interestingly, in some conditions, a previously unreported ″velocity saturation″ effect was observed. When examined across a range of different liquids, the forces at which this saturation occurs seem to be lower for liquids with smaller surface tensions. Furthermore, when driven at forces that cause saturation, physical phenomena are observed that are akin to what has been reported for stationary droplets in the electrowetting literature. These phenomena are detrimental to device performance, leading to a new “force window” approach that delineates the optimum operation conditions for different liquids. We propose that these findings may be useful for a wide range of applications for experts and new users alike in this growing field.},

The sensors were designed to have different configurations and were constructed on different substrates. The substrate variation was used to investigate the effect of substrate properties on sensing performance. The first design was fabricated on a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) material made from a FR4 fiberglass; the second sensor design was fabricated using thick film on alumina. The third sensor was designed using thin-film [microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)] technology and was fabricated on a glass substrate. The performances of the sensors were evaluated for different configurations of the electrode structures as well as dielectric materials. Initial experiments have been conducted to analyze the sensor’s performance with two peptide derivatives, namely, Sarcosine and Proline. These peptides are closely related to the target molecule of domoic acid, a natural toxin in seafood. Experiments with endotoxin have been presented and the possibility of extending the sensors for detection of chemicals responsible for food poisoning has been discussed. Initial investigation on the sensors’ performance based on Impedance Spectroscopy method is reported in this paper.},

Electrostatic interaction between the most electronegative element fluorine (F) and hydrogen (H) is one of the strong interactions in hydrogen bonding, and here we report the selective binding of ammonia/ammonium with F in fluorographene (FG) resulting to a change in the impedance of the system. Very low limit of detection value of \textasciitilde 0.44 pM with linearity over wide range of concentrations (1 pM–0.1\,μM) is achieved using the FG based impedance sensor, andthisscreen printed FG sensor works in both ionized (ammonium) and un-ionized ammonia sensing platforms.

There remains a high demand for effective field-based detection of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) analytes to aid in mitigating nitrogen loading. Electrochemical approaches show increasing potential to fill this role as advancements in nanotechnology continually improve analytical performance and on-site applicability. However, translating these improvements into the field still faces the resonating challenges of reaching analytical proficiency (selectivity, sensitivity, robustness, stability), practical end-user functionality, minimal matrix interferences and cost effectiveness. Herein, we elaborate on these challenges via a critical evaluation of current studies and examine how realistic the prospects of on-site nitrate, nitrite and ammonium are. We also present recommendations in addressing these gaps to conclude the review.},

The growing need for application specific DMF chips challenges efficient handling of the increasing chip design and programming complexity. To address this, we propose a correct-by-construction modular chip design approach, which allows chips to be constructed from a component library and verified by simulation before fabrication. After fabrication, the chip is operated from a smartphone by remote instrumentation of a portable DMF chip control device. By combining structured design techniques with custom developed hardware and software tools, we present a full end-toend solution for fast DMF chip design, simulation and operation.},

A range of practical LOC fabrication technologies has already been demonstrated, and as a result, the research of real life applications has been steadily increasing. However, due to the variety of used technologies and LOC form factors, it often requires a modification or even a complete redesign of the available instrumentation systems. Standardization and flexible instrumentation has seen limited development in the LOC field even though developing on all application levels has been proven as an effective way to stimulate a growth in a research field. To address this, we present a modular digital microfluidics (DMF) instrumentation platform and a concept of integrated chip-instrument co-design that has the potential to solve a wide range of LOC instrumentation challenges.},

This work proposes the use of such hardware for security purposes through the randomization of checkpoints in both space and time, and provides design guidelines for designers of such systems. We define security metrics and present techniques for improving performance through static checkpoint maps, and describe performance trade-offs associated with static and random checkpoints. We also provide detailed classification of attack models and demonstrate the feasibility of our techniques with case studies on assays implemented in typical DMFB hardware.},

Despite this progress, security of DMFBs has not been adequately addressed. We present an analysis of a DMFB system prone to malicious modification of routes and propose a DMFB defense based on spatio-temporal randomized checkpoints using CCD cameras. Absent the knowledge of the time- and space-randomized checkpoints, an attacker cannot navigate the DMFB without alerting the system. We present an algorithm to guide the placement and timing of the checkpoints such that the probability that an attack can evade detection is minimized. The efficacy of the defense mechanism is illustrated with a case study under stealthy malicious modifications.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs)—an emerging technology that implements bioassays through manipulation of discrete fluid droplets—are vulnerable to actuation tampering attacks, where a malicious adversary modifies control signals for the purposes of manipulating results or causing denial-of-service. Such attacks leverage the highly programmable nature of DMFBs. However, practical DMFBs often employ a technique called pin mapping to reduce control pin count while simultaneously reducing the degrees of freedom available for droplet manipulation. Attempts to control specific electrodes as part of an attack cannot be made without inadvertently actuating other electrodes on-chip, which makes the tampering evident. This paper explores this tamperresistance property of pin mapping in detail. We derive relevant security metrics, evaluate the tamper-resistance of several existing pin mapping algorithms, and propose a new security-aware pin mapper with superior tamper-resistance as compared to prior work.},

Their larger surface area to volume ratio, which offers them the capacity to improve electron-transfer rate are quite utilized in catalysis, polymer technology, drug delivery, food production, painting and electrochemical sensing. Since electrochemical sensors are required to be of very high sensitivity, selectivity and stability, incorporation of nanomaterials in the sensors’ design is inevitable due to their aforementioned properties. So many work have therefore been reported in which nanomaterials ranging from nanoparticles to nanotubes were used for improving the properties of sensors and the results of these researches have been so far promising. This article therefore intends to present some of these works and showcase the relevance of nanomaterials in electrochemical sensor developments.},

  abstract = {The issue of food contamination by pathogens has become extreme serious due to the insensitive detection techniques. Escherichia coli O157:H7 is one of the harmful bacterial pathogens which is distributed in soil, marine and estuarine waters, the intestinal tract of animals, or water contaminated with fecal matter. Escherichia coli O157:H7, is an enterohaemorrhagic strain of the bacterium Escherichia coli (E.coli) and a cause of foodborne illness. It can cause serious human gastrointestinal disease. A small amount of E.coli with the dose fewer than 100 organisms in food products or water is enough to cause serious illness to human. Therefore, there is a need for a more sensitive, rapid method and yet a cost effective method to examine the food and environment safety. In this case, there are many CMOS fabricated acoustic waves based technologies which are initially designed for telecommunication applications and have been developed for pathogen detection recently due to their ultra-sensitivity to the surface changes. This paper reviews the detection of E.coli (one of the dangerous food pathogens), the design, characteristic and types of CMOS fabricated acoustic wave-based methods, typically surface acoustic waves (SAW) as for their label free, selective and ultra-sensitive detection and also their advantages over the current equipment such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and quartz crystal microbalances (QCM). Besides that, the elements and principle of SAW sensors are explored in E.coli DNA detection and the advantages of DNA probe over antibody probe. It also highlights the limitations of some types of acoustic waves based sensors for the E.coli detection.},

In addition, components associated with fluidic control of the device, more specifically the valves and pumps, contribute significantly to the overall unit cost. Here we sketch the problem of a gap between high end accurate, but expensive sensor platforms,               versus               less accurate, but widely employable hand-held low-cost devices. Recent research has shown that the integration of light-responsive materials within microfluidic devices can provide the function of expensive fluidic components, and potentially enable sophisticated measurements to be made using much less expensive equipment. An overview of the most recent developments will be presented for valves, mixers, transport and sample handling inside microfluidic devices.},

  abstract = {Rapid prototyping methods enable the widespread adoption of microfluidic technologies by empowering end-users from non-engineering disciplines to make devices using processes that are rapid, simple and inexpensive. In this work, we developed a liquid molding technique to create silicone/PDMS microfluidic devices by replica molding. To construct a liquid mold, we use inexpensive adhesive-backed paper, an acetate backing sheet, and an off-the-shelf digital cutter to create paper molds, which we then wet with predetermined amounts of water. Due to the immiscibility of water and PDMS, mold patterns can be effectively transferred onto PDMS similarly to solid molds. We demonstrate the feasibility of these wet paper molds for the fabrication of PDMS microfluidic devices and assess the influence of various process parameters on device yield and quality. This method possesses some distinct benefits compared to conventional techniques such as photolithography and 3D printing. First, we demonstrate that the shape of a channel’s crosssection may be altered from rectangular to semicircular by merely modifying the wetting parameters. Second, we illustrate how electrical impedance can be utilized as a marker for inspecting mold quality and identifying defects in a non-invasive manner without using visual tools such as microscopes or cameras. As a proof-of-concept device, we created a microfluidic T-junction droplet generator to produce water droplets in mineral oil ranging in size from 1.2 µL to 75 µL. We feel that this technology is an excellent addition to the microfluidic rapid prototyping toolbox and will find several applications in biological research.},

Since some reactants like costly reagents and infant’s blood are valuable, their usage should be minimized during dilution. In this paper, we propose an optimal reactant minimization algorithm, GORMA, for sample preparation on digital microfluidic biochips. GORMA adopts a systematic method to exhaustively check all possible dilution solutions and then identifies the one with minimal reactant usage and waste through maximal droplet sharing. Experimental results show that GORMA outperforms all the existing methods in reactant usage. Meanwhile, the waste amount is reduced up to 30\% as compared with existing waste minimization methods. Moreover, GORMA requires only 0.6\% more operations on average when compared with an operation-minimal dilution method.},

Among the available solutions, Raspberry Pi represents one of the most used SBCs. In the present work, two setups based on Raspberry Pi and its CMOS-based camera (a 3D-printed device and an adaptation of a commercial product named We-Lab) were investigated as diagnostic instruments. Different camera elaboration processes were investigated, showing how direct access to the 10-bit raw data acquired from the sensor before downstream imaging processes could be beneficial for photometric applications. The developed solution was successfully applied to the evaluation of the oxidative stress using two commercial kits (d-ROM Fast; PAT). We suggest the analysis of raw data applied to SBC and MCB platforms in order to improve results.},

Owing to its simplicity and effectiveness, electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) is one of the most commonly studied and applied effects to implement DMF. However, complex biomedical assays usually require more sophisticated sample handling and detection capabilities than basic EWOD manipulation. Alternatively, combined systems integrating EWOD actuators and other fluidic handling techniques are essential for bringing DMF into practical use. In this paper, we briefly review the main approaches for the integration/combination of EWOD with other microfluidic manipulation methods or additional external fields for specified biomedical applications. The form of integration ranges from independently operating sub-systems to fully coupled hybrid actuators. The corresponding biomedical applications of these works are also summarized to illustrate the significance of these innovative combination attempts.},

  abstract = {On-chip functional blocks for sample preprocessing are necessary elements for the implementation of fully portable micrototal analysis systems (μTAS). We demonstrate and characterize the microparticle and whole-blood manipulation capabilities of surface acoustic wave (SAW) driven counterflow micropumps. The motion of suspended cells in this system is governed by the two dominant acoustic forces associated with the scattered SAW (of wavelength λf): acoustic-radiation force and acoustic-streaming Stokesian drag force. We show that by reducing the microchannel height (h) beyond a threshold value the balance of these forces is shifted toward the acoustic-radiation force and that this yields control of two different regimes of microparticle dynamics. In the regime dominated by the acoustic radiation force (h ≲ λf), microparticles are collected in the seminodes of the partial standing sound-wave arising from reflections off microchannel walls. This enables the complete separation of plasma and corpuscular components of whole blood in periodical predetermined positions without any prior sample dilution. Conversely, in the regime dominated by acoustic streaming (h ≫ λf), the microbeads follow vortical streamlines in a pattern characterized by three different phases during microchannel filling. This makes it possible to generate a cell-concentration gradient within whole-blood samples, a behavior not previously reported in any acoustic-streaming device. By careful device design, a new class of SAW pumping devices is presented that allows the manipulation and pretreatment of whole-blood samples for portable and integrable biological chips and is compatible with handheld battery-operated devices.},

This review, based on about 100 original research papers, presents the achievements in this field over the past ten years. Various methodologies for establishing flow-injection measurements are reviewed, together with microfluidics and portable systems. The developed applications mostly concern not only the determination of inorganic analytes but also the speciation analysis of different elements, and the determination of several total indices of water quality. Examples of the determination of organic residues (e.g., pesticides, phenolic compounds, and surfactants) in natural surface waters, seawater, groundwater, and drinking water have also been identified. Usually, changes in the format of manual procedures for flow-injection determination results in the improvement of various operational parameters, such as the limits of detection, the sampling rate, or selectivity in different matrices.},

The fluids are set in motion using the electrowetting effect resulting in a pressure difference inside the tube. A model of the pressure field for various viscosities of the surrounding fluid is obtained by finite element analysis of the Navier-Stokes equation. From the time-dependent pressure response and the associated viscous damping, a correlation with the fluid’s dynamic viscosity is obtained. In the next step, we study the pressure evolution after driving the polar fluid in one direction and stopping it rapidly at the edge of the driving electrode. The decay time of the pressure induced height difference inside the PCCs can also be related to the surrounding non-polar fluid’s viscosity. Subsequently, an alternative low-cost fabrication process of an EWOD stack is used to build the device simulated. The built device is tested by measuring silicon oils and a comparison between already established methods for viscosity sensing and our “tube” method is made.},

  abstract = {Microfluidics is a rapidly growing discipline that involves studying and manipulating fluids at reduced length scale and volume, typically on the scale of micro- or nanoliters. Under the reduced length scale and larger surface-to-volume ratio, advantages of low reagent consumption, faster reaction kinetics, and more compact systems are evident in microfluidics. However, miniaturization of microfluidic chips and systems introduces challenges of stricter tolerances in designing and controlling them for interdisciplinary applications. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have brought innovation to microfluidics from design, simulation, automation, and optimization to bioanalysis and data analytics. In microfluidics, the Navier–Stokes equations, which are partial differential equations describing viscous fluid motion that in complete form are known to not have a general analytical solution, can be simplified and have fair performance through numerical approximation due to low inertia and laminar flow. Approximation using neural networks trained by rules of physical knowledge introduces a new possibility to predict the physicochemical nature. The combination of microfluidics and automation can produce large amounts of data, where features and patterns that are difficult to discern by a human can be extracted by machine learning. Therefore, integration with AI introduces the potential to revolutionize the microfluidic workflow by enabling the precision control and automation of data analysis. Deployment of smart microfluidics may be tremendously beneficial in various applications in the future, including high-throughput drug discovery, rapid point-of-care-testing (POCT), and personalized medicine. In this review, we summarize key microfluidic advances integrated with AI and discuss the outlook and possibilities of combining AI and microfluidics.},

Beads with 1.5 lm diameter flowing in a 100 lm deep channel were trapped at 7.5 MHz using a 23.7 peak-to-peak voltage (Vpp) sinusoidal input. The trap located at 50 ± 0.1 lm depth was measured to have a stiffness of approximately 0.6 pN/lm. With this simple device we can trap and control the axial position of micrometer scale objects, which allows for the manipulation of beads and cells. We intend to use the device for force spectroscopy on micro-bead tethered DNA. This can be combined with super-resolution imaging techniques to study mechanics and binding of protein structures along a DNA strand as a function of induced tension.},

We report for the first time the use of this technique for the fabrication of solid-state electrochemical gas sensors of the mixed potential type and assessment of variability in the manufacturing process. La0.87Sr0.13CrO3 (LSCO) and Pt electrodes bridged with a porous yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) have been deposited on YSZ substrates by direct-write extrusion of pastes and inks. The sensors are evaluated for their sensitivity to 200 ppm of NOx, C3H8, and NH3. There is a need to understand how variations in intrinsic materials parameters during manufacturing such as differences in porosity affect the gas sensing of additively manufactured sensors to guide optimization of their performance and serve as quality control techniques. Further characterizations of these devices include electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and an aqueous electrochemical assessment of the electrode surface area and diffusion through the porous layer. We find a correlation of increased sensitivity with larger gas reaction impedance, higher Pt electrode surface area, and slower diffusion.},

This paper presents an automated endpoint detection system for amplicons generated by loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) on a microfluidic compact disk platform. The developed detection system utilizes a monochromatic ultraviolet (UV) emitter for excitation of fluorescent labeled LAMP amplicons and a color sensor to detect the emitted florescence from target. Then it processes the sensor output and displays the detection results on liquid crystal display (LCD). The sensitivity test has been performed with detection limit up to 2.5 × 10−3 ng/µL with different DNA concentrations of Salmonella bacteria. This system allows a rapid and automatic endpoint detection which could lead to the development of a point-of-care diagnosis device for foodborne pathogens detection in a resource-limited environment.},

Digital microfluidics system has extended the scope of microfluidics by providing automated, precise flow control for point-of-care devices capable of medical diagnostics, environmental, and chemical sensing platforms. In this paper, we introduce a digital microfluidics platform based on electrowetting on a dielectric using PCB substrate designed on Easy EDA software. The platform’s performance was analyzed at various DC voltages between 200 V and 400 V for droplet actuation. PCB fabrication, the utilization of easily accessible and cheap materials such as cooking oil and grafting tape as a dielectric layer, allowed the fabrication to be affordable and simple. The results indicate that droplet actuation takes place at 220 V. The droplet velocity obtained was 2.6 mm/s and 1.51 mm/s using silicon oil and cooking oil, respectively, at 400 V. Our proposed digital microfluidics platform will play a vital role in droplet actuation and can be used for diagnostic applications such as DNA analysis and cell culture due to its simple fabrication and cost-effective technique.},

Here, we investigated the sorting of CD8 lymphocytes from peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) products by affinity-bead-mediated acoustophoresis. PBPC samples were obtained from healthy donors (n = 4) and patients (n = 18). Mononuclear cells were labeled with anti-CD8-coated magnetic beads and sorted on an acoustophoretic microfluidic device and by standard magnetic cell sorting as a reference method. CD8 lymphocytes were acoustically sorted with a mean purity of 91\% ˘ 8\% and a median separation efficiency of 63\% (range 15.1\%–90.5\%) as compared to magnetic sorting (purity 91\% ˘ 14\%, recovery 29\% (range 5.1\%–47.3\%)). The viability as well as the proliferation capacity of sorted lymphocytes in the target fraction were unimpaired and, furthermore, hematopoietic progenitor cell assay revealed a preserved clonogenic capacity post-sorting. Bead-mediated acoustophoresis can, therefore, be utilized to efficiently sort less frequent CD8+ lymphocytes from PBPC products in a continuous flow mode while maintaining cell viability and functional capacity of both target and non-target fractions.},

This paper presents the use of acoustophoresis, an ultrasound based microfluidic separation technology, for label-free, gentle and continuous separation of mononuclear cells (MNCs) from diluted whole blood. Red blood cells (RBCs) and MNCs behave similar in an acoustic standing wave field, compromising acoustic separation of MNC from RBC in standard buffer systems. However, by optimizing the buffer conditions and thereby changing the acoustophoretic mobility of the cells, we were able to enrich MNCs relative to RBCs by a factor of 2,800 with MNC recoveries up to 88\%. The acoustophoretic microchip can perform cell separation at a processing rate of more than 1\,×\,10               5               cells/s, corresponding to 5\,µl/min undiluted whole blood equivalent. Thus, acoustophoresis can be easily integrated with further down-stream applications such as flow cytometry, making it a superior alternative to existing MNC isolation techniques.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            A novel method of modeling multiple frequency dielectrophoresis (MFDEP) is introduced based on the concept of an effective Clausius–Mossotti factor, CM               eff               , for a particle that is exposed to electrical fields of different frequencies, coming either from one or multiple pairs of electrodes. This analysis clearly illustrates how adding frequencies adds control parameters, up to two additional parameters               per               frequency. As a result, MFDEP can be used for a wide variety of applications, including separating particles with very similar Clausius–Mossotti spectra, trapping multiple groups of cells simultaneously, and cancelling unwanted dielectrophoretic traps. Illustrating the modeling approach, we determine the CM               eff               s for live and dead yeast cells, and then predict their equilibrium distribution on a three‐electrode configuration, with two electrodes at different frequencies and the third electrode at ground. This prediction is validated experimentally, using MFDEP to selectively attract live cells to one location and dead cells to another, trapping both. These results demonstrate that the use of multiple frequencies for the manipulation of particles can enhance the performance of dielectrophoretic devices, not only for sorting, but also for such applications as patterning cells in close proximity for the formation of cell consortia.},

We fabricated a 5 × 5 array of individually controlled electrowetting cells to manipulate silicone oil droplets via EWOD. The fabrication process utilized exclusively flexible materials to improve the robustness of the overall device, and processing methods were adapted to accommodate the particular challenges posed by flexible materials. Simulation of the EWOD devices was conducted using ANSYS Fluent and showed the change in contact angle in response to voltage applied. Fabricated devices were also tested, with actuation of the oil droplet observed with up to 100 V (RMS) AC applied across underlying electrodes. We demonstrated fabrication of a fully flexible array and verified actuation to center droplets over the electrodes.

  abstract = {Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) lab-on-a-chip systems have already proven their potential within a broad range of bio-assays. Nevertheless, research on the analytical performance of those systems is limited, yet crucial for a further breakthrough in the diagnostic field. Therefore, this paper presents the intrinsic possibilities of an EWOD lab-on-a-chip as a versatile platform for homogeneous and heterogeneous bio-assays with high analytical performance. Both droplet dispensing and splitting cause variations in droplet size, thereby directly influencing the assay’s performance. The extent to which they influence the performance is assessed by a theoretical sensitivity analysis, which allows the definition of a basic framework for the reduction of droplet size variability. Taking advantage of the optimized droplet manipulations, both homogeneous and heterogeneous bio-assays are implemented in the EWOD lab-on-a-chip to demonstrate the analytical capabilities and versatility of the device. A fully on-chip enzymatic assay is realized with high analytical performance. It demonstrates the promising capabilities of an EWOD lab-on-a-chip in food-related and medical applications, such as nutritional and blood analyses. Further, a magnetic bio-assay for IgE detection using superparamagnetic nanoparticles is presented whereby the nanoparticles are used as solid carriers during the bio-assay. Crucial elements are the precise manipulation of the superparamagnetic nanoparticles with respect to dispensing and separation. Although the principle of using nano-carriers is demonstrated for protein detection, it can be easily extended to a broader range of bio-related applications like DNA sensing. In heterogeneous bio-assays the chip surface is actively involved during the execution of the bio-assay. Through immobilization of specific biological compounds like DNA, proteins and cells a reactive chip surface is realized, which enhances the bio-assay performance. To demonstrate this potential, on-chip adhesion islands are fabricated to immobilize MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Viability studies are performed to assess the functionalization efficiency.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The direction of modern analytical techniques is to push for lower detection limits, improved selectivity and sensitivity, faster analysis time, higher throughput, and more inexpensive analysis systems with ever‐decreasing sample volumes. These very ambitious goals are exacerbated by the need to reduce the overall size of the device and the instrumentation – the quest for functional micrototal analysis systems epitomizes this. Microfluidic devices fabricated in glass, and more recently, in a variety of polymers, brings us a step closer to being able to achieve these stringent goals and to realize the economical fabrication of sophisticated instrumentation. However, this places a significant burden on the detection systems associated with microchip‐based analysis systems. There is a need for a universal detector that can efficiently detect sample analytes in real time and with minimal sample manipulation steps, such as lengthy labeling protocols. This review highlights the advances in uncommon or less frequently used detection methods associated with microfluidic devices. As a result, the three most common methods – LIF, electrochemical, and mass spectrometric techniques – are omitted in order to focus on the more esoteric detection methods reported in the literature over the last 2\,years.},

  abstract = {Droplet microfluidic screens are an important high-throughput technology in the discovery, product optimization, and analysis of biotechnology applications. This review discusses the current use of droplet-based screens, explains the emerging trend of interaction assays in microfluidic droplets, and explains why droplets are particularly suited for this application. The interactions of many different biological entities can be screened, including antibodies, enzymes, DNA, RNA, eukaryotic cells and microorganisms, drugs, and other molecules. Recent breakthroughs have enabled new scales of bioanalysis and biotechnological product design. Recent methodology advances that expand droplet-based screens to new environments are also highlighted, including cargo delivery inside the body, application of synthetic gene circuits in the natural environment, 3D-printing, and designing droplet structures that respond to environmental signals.},

  abstract = {A new feedback and biological analysis system for digital microfluidics that uses an imaging based setup.           ,              Digital microfluidics (DMF) is a technology that provides a means of manipulating nL–μL volumes of liquids on an array of electrodes. By applying an electric potential to an electrode, these discrete droplets can be controlled in parallel which can be transported, mixed, reacted, and analyzed. Typically, an automation system is interfaced with a DMF device that uses a standard set of basic instructions written by the user to execute droplet operations. Here, we present the first feedback method for DMF that relies on imaging techniques that will allow online detection of droplets without the need to reactivate all destination electrodes. Our system consists of integrating open-source electronics with a CMOS camera and a zoom lens for acquisition of the images that will be used to detect droplets on the device. We also created an algorithm that uses a Hough transform to detect a variety of droplet sizes and to detect singular droplet dispensing and movement failures on the device. As a first test, we applied this feedback system to test droplet movement for a variety of liquids used in cell-based assays and to optimize different feedback actuation schemes to improve droplet movement fidelity. We also applied our system to a colorimetric enzymatic assay to show that our system is capable of biological analysis. Overall, we believe that using our approach of integrating imaging and feedback for DMF can provide a platform for automating biological assays with analysis.},

The objective of the study was to examine the chemical, physical and biological characteristics of the river and to determine the level and classification at each site based on the Water Quality Index (WQI) and National Water Quality Standards (NWQS). Water samples from the river were subjected to in-situ and laboratory water quality analyses and focused on six (6) important parameters based on WQI which are Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD5), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Suspended Solid (TSS), Ammoniacal Nitrogen (NH3-N), and pH. All testing procedures used in this study adhered to the American Public Health Association (APHA) testing procedures. Based on the results obtained, the quality of water for four (4) sampling stations along Sg. Perak can be concluded as CLASS III with only one station concluded as CLASS IV according to the National Water Quality Standards (NWQS). For Sg. Kinta, four sampling stations were classified as CLASS III whereas only one station falls into CLASS II. It is important to determine the WQI at different areas of along the river in order to predict (possible) points of pollution for monitoring purposes.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce computer-aided microfluidics (CAMF), a process that allows the creation of complex microfluidic structures from their concept to the actual chip within a day. During design and testing of new microfluidic systems, rapid and frequent design modifications have to be carried out. For this purpose, a device using maskless projection lithography based on a digital mirror device (DMD) has been developed. Digital mask layouts may be created using any graphics program (Microsoft Paint, Adobe Photoshop) and can be used as such by the custom-written control software of the system. However, we suggest using another approach: direct importing of three-dimensional digital computer-aided design (CAD) models from which mask information can be directly parsed. This process is advantageous as commercial 3D-CAD systems allow the rapid generation of static or parameterized models which can be used for computerized analyses like, e.g., flow simulation. After model validation, the mask information is extracted from these models and directly used by the lithography device. A chip or replication master is then created by means of lithography using curable monomers or resists as, e.g., Accura 60 or SU-8. With CAMF, the whole process from digital 3D model creation to actually running the experiment can be done within a day.},

  abstract = {The dream of human beings for long living has stimulated the rapid development of biomedical and healthcare equipment. However, conventional biomedical and healthcare devices have shortcomings such as short service life, large equipment size, and high potential safety hazards. Indeed, the power supply for conventional implantable device remains predominantly batteries. The emerging nanogenerators, which harvest micro/nanomechanical energy and thermal energy from human beings and convert into electrical energy, provide an ideal solution for self‐powering of biomedical devices. The combination of nanogenerators and biomedicine has been accelerating the development of self‐powered biomedical equipment. This article first introduces the operating principle of nanogenerators and then reviews the progress of nanogenerators in biomedical applications, including power supply, smart sensing, and effective treatment. Besides, the microbial disinfection and biodegradation performances of nanogenerators have been updated. Next, the protection devices have been discussed such as face mask with air filtering function together with real‐time monitoring of human health from the respiration and heat emission. Besides, the nanogenerator devices have been categorized by the types of mechanical energy from human beings, such as the body movement, tissue and organ activities, energy from chemical reactions, and gravitational potential energy. Eventually, the challenges and future opportunities in the applications of nanogenerators are delivered in the conclusive remarks.                                                                image},

  abstract = {Determining the distributions and variations of chemical elements in oceans has significant meanings for understanding the biogeochemical cycles, evaluating seawater pollution, and forecasting the occurrence of marine disasters. The primary chemical parameters of ocean monitoring include nutrients, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and heavy metals. At present, ocean monitoring mainly relies on laboratory analysis, which is hindered in applications due to its large size, high power consumption, and low representative and time-sensitive detection results. By integrating photonics and microfluidics into one chip, optofluidics brings new opportunities to develop portable microsystems for ocean monitoring. Optofluidic platforms have advantages in respect of size, cost, timeliness, and parallel processing of samples compared with traditional instruments. This review describes the applications of optofluidic platforms on autonomous and in situ ocean environmental monitoring, with an emphasis on their principles, sensing properties, advantages, and disadvantages. Predictably, autonomous and in situ systems based on optofluidic platforms will have important applications in ocean environmental monitoring.},

Compared with traditional digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs), P-DMFBs enjoy notable advantages, such as faster in-place fabrication with printer and ink, lower costs, better disposability, etc. Because electrodes and CNT control lines are printed on the same side of a paper, a new design challenge for P-DMFB is to prevent the interference between moving droplets and the voltages on CNT control lines. These interactions may result in unexpected droplet movements and thus incorrect assay outputs.},

  abstract = {As digital microfluidics-based biochips find more applications, their complexity is expected to increase significantly owing to the trend of multiple and concurrent assays on the chip. There is a pressing need to deliver a top-down design methodology that the biochip designer can leverage the same level of computer-aided design support as the semi-conductor industry now does. Moreover, as microelectronics fabrication technology is scaling up and integrated device performance is improving, it is expected that these microfluidic biochips will be integrated with microelectronic components in nextgeneration system-on-chip designs. This study presents the analysis and experiments of digital microfluidic operations on a novel electrowetting-on-dielectric-based ‘micro-electrode dot array architecture’ that fosters a development path for hierarchical top-down design approach for digital microfluidics. The proposed architecture allows dynamic configurations and activations of identical basic microfluidic unit called ‘micro-electrode cells’ to design microfluidic components, layouts, routing, microfluidic operations and applications of the biochip hierarchically. Fundamental microfluidic operations have been successfully performed by the architecture. In addition, this novel architecture demonstrates a number of advantages and flexibilities over the conventional digital microfluidics in performing advanced microfluidic operations.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a new efficient in-droplet magnetic particle concentration and separation method, where magnetic particles are concentrated and separated into a split droplet by using a permanent magnet and EWOD (electrowetting on dielectric) droplet manipulation. To evaluate the method, testing devices are fabricated by the micro fabrication technology. First, this method is examined for magnetic particle concentration, showing that over 91\% of magnetic particles can be concentrated into a split daughter droplet. Then, separation between magnetic and non-magnetic particles is examined for two different cases of particle mixture, showing in both cases that over 91\% of the magnetic particles can be concentrated into split daughter droplets. However, a significant number of the non-magnetic particles (over 35\%) co-exist with the magnetic particles in the same daughter droplets. This problem is circumvented by adding a droplet-merging step prior to applying the magnetic field. Finally, over 94\% of the total magnetic particles are separated into a one split daughter droplet while 92\% of the non-magnetic particles into the other split daughter droplet. This integrated in-droplet separation method may bridge many existing magnetic particle assays to digital microfluidics and extend their application scope.},

  abstract = {In order to get rid of the dependence on expensive photolithography technology and related facilities, an economic and simple design and fabrication technology for digital microfluidics (DMF) is proposed. The electrodes pattern was generated by inkjet printing nanosilver conductive ink on the flexible Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate with a 3D circuit board printer, food wrap film was attached to the electrode array to act as the dielectric layer and Teflon® AF was sprayed to form a hydrophobic layer. The PET substrate and food wrap film are low cost and accessible to general users. The proposed flexible DMF chips can be reused for a long time by replacing the dielectric film coated with hydrophobic layer. The resolution and conductivity of silver traces and the contact angle and velocity of the droplets were evaluated to demonstrate that the proposed technology is comparable to the traditional DMF fabrication process. As far as the rapid prototyping of DMF is concerned, this technology has shown very attractive advantages in many aspects, such as fabrication cost, fabrication time, material selection and mass production capacity, without sacrificing the performance of DMF. The flexible DMF chips have successfully implemented basic droplet operations on a square and hexagon electrode array.},

  abstract = {Models of electrochemical sensors play a critical role for electronic engineers in designing electrochemical nanosensor-based integrated systems and are also widely used in analyzing chemical reactions to model the current, electrical potential, and impedance occurring at the surface of an electrode. However, the use of jargon and the different perspectives of scientists and electronic engineers often result in different viewpoints on principles of electrochemical models, which can impede the effective development of sensor technology. This paper is aimed to fill the knowledge gap between electronic engineers and scientists by providing a review and an analysis of electrochemical models. First, a brief review of the electrochemical sensor mechanism from a scientist’s perspective is presented. Then a general model, which reflects a more realistic situation of nanosensors is proposed from an electronic engineer point of view and a comparison between the Randles Model is given with its application in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and general sensor design. Finally, with the help of the proposed equivalent model, a cohesive explanation of the scan rate of cyclic voltammetry is discussed. The information of this paper can contribute to enriching the knowledge of electrochemical sensor models for scientists and is also able to guide the electronic engineer on designing next-generation sensor layouts.},

  abstract = {Single-cell analysis serves as an important approach to study cell functions and interactions. Catering to the demand of Big Data Era, fast reactions for single cells and paralleled high-throughput analysis have become an urgent need. Microdroplet in microfluidics has advantages of modularity and integrity, as well as high throughput and sensitivity, which present great potential in the field of single-cell analysis. This review is carried out on three aspects to introduce microdroplet chips for single-cell analysis: droplet formation, droplet detection and practical functions. Structures of droplet formation are categorized into three types, including T-shaped channel, flow-involved channel and three-dimensional micro-vortice. The detection methods, including fluorescence, Raman spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy and electrochemical detection, are summarized from applications. Both pros and cons for existing techniques are reviewed and discussed. The functions of microdroplets-on-chip cover cell culture, nucleic acid test and cell identification. For each field, principles/mechanisms and/or schematic images are laconically introduced. Microdroplet in microfluidics has become a major research direction in single-cell analysis. With updated methods of droplet formation such as inertial ordering and micro-vortice, microdroplets-based biochips will expect high throughput detection and high-accuracy trace detection for clinical diagnosis in the near future.},

  abstract = {Developments of portable biosensors for field-deployable detections have been increasingly important to control foodborne pathogens in regulatory environment and in early stage of outbreaks. Conventional cultivation and gene amplification methods require sophisticated instruments and highly skilled professionals; while portable biosensing devices provide more freedom for rapid detections not only in research laboratories but also in the field; however, their sensitivity and specificity are limited. Microfluidic methods have the advantage of miniaturizing instrumental size while integrating multiple functions and high-throughput capability into one streamlined system at low cost. Minimal sample consumption is another advantage to detect samples in different sizes and concentrations, which is important for the close monitoring of pathogens at consumer end. They improve measurement or manipulation of bacteria by increasing the ratio of functional interface of the device to the targeted biospecies and in turn reducing background interference. This article introduces the major active and passive microfluidic devices that have been used for bacteria sampling and biosensing. The emphasis is on particle-based sorting/enrichment methods with or without external physical fields applied to the microfluidic devices and on various biosensing applications reported for bacteria sampling. Three major fabrication methods for microfluidics are briefly discussed with their advantages and limitations. The applications of these active and passive microfluidic sampling methods in the past 5 years have been summarized, with the focus on Escherichia coli and Salmonella. The current challenges to microfluidic bacteria sampling are caused by the small size and nonspherical shape of various bacterial cells, which can induce unpredictable deviations in sampling and biosensing processes. Future studies are needed to develop rapid prototyping methods for device manufacturing, which can facilitate rapid response to various foodborne pathogen outbreaks.},

Emerging microfluidics, a highly miniaturized, automatic, and integrated technol‑ogy, are a potential substitute for traditional methods in performing rapid, low‑cost, accurate, and on‑site diagnoses. Molecular diagnostics are widely used in microfluidic devices as the most effective approaches for pathogen detec‑tion. This review summarizes the latest advances in microfluidics‑based molecular diagnostics for infectious diseases from academic perspectives and industrial outlooks. First, we introduce the typical on‑chip nucleic acid processes, including sample preprocessing, amplification, and signal read‑out. Then, four categories of microfluidic platforms are compared with respect to features, merits, and demerits. We further discuss application of the digital assay in absolute nucleic acid quantification. Both the classic and recent microfluidics‑based commercial molecular diagnostic devices are summarized as proof of the current market status. Finally, we propose future directions for microfluidics‑based infectious disease diagnosis.},

CQDs can be prepared simply and inexpensively by multiple techniques, such as the arc-discharge method, microwave pyrolysis, hydrothermal method, and electrochemical synthesis. CQDs show excellent physical and chemical properties like high crystallization, good dispersibility, photoluminescence properties. In particular, the small size, superconductivity, and rapid electron transfer of CQDs endow the CQDs-based composite with improved electric conductivity and catalytic activity. Besides, CQDs have abundant functional groups on the surface which could facilitate the preparation of multi-component electrical active catalysts. The interactions inside these multi-component catalysts may further enhance the catalytic performance by promoting charge transfer which plays an important role in electrochemistry. Most recent researches on CQDs have focused on their fluorescence characteristics and photocatalytic properties. This review will summarize the primary advances of CQDs in the synthetic methods, excellent physical and electronic properties, and application in electrocatalysis, including oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reduction (HER), and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR).},

There are very high requirements for the volume of single droplet in many biochemical applications. Droplet dispensing and splitting are two main operations to generate a single droplet in DMF. Therefore, the generation of droplets with high volume precision and accuracy in the two droplet operations is one of the keys to the efficient application of DMF in biochemical analysis. We have developed a novel droplet dispensing and splitting scheme where electrode geometry is optimized. The liquid column can contract in a regular shape, which keep the neck shape uniform and stable, and the position of pinch-off point was fixed; meanwhile, the liquid tail is eliminated before pinching off, so that the precision and accuracy of droplet volume were greatly improved. The increase in the radius of the cutting electrodes elongated the droplet neck and increased the neck curvature at the pinch-off point, which further effectively improved the precision and accuracy of droplet volume. The optimized droplet splitting scheme can also be applied to the droplet splitting with unequal volume effectively.},

The resistance value of the RGO-Gr hybrid is the indicator of the ammonia concentration and controlled by effective charge transport from RGO to graphene after ammonia molecule adsorption. In this hybrid material, RGO is the adsorbing layer to catch ammonia molecules and graphene is the conductive layer to effectively enhance charge/electron transport. Compared to a RGO gas sensor, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the RGO-Gr is increased from 22 to 1008. Meanwhile, the response of the RGO-Gr gas sensor is better than that of either a pristine graphene or RGO gas sensor. It is found that the RGO reduction time is related to the content of functional groups that directly reflect on the gas sensing properties of the sensor. The RGO-Gr gas sensor with 10 min reduction time has the best gas sensing properties in this type of sensor. The highest sensitivity is 2.88\% towards 0.5 ppm, and the ammonia gas detection limit is calculated to be 36 ppb.},

This research expands the two-dimensional conventional digital microfluidic architecture into a three-dimensional architecture. The concept relies on the possibility that back and forth motions between open and covered regions are possible under electrowetting actuation. Two face-to-face plates based on "microelectrode dot array" (MEDA) architecture form the foundation of the two-layer microfluidic operations and a dual open/covered hybrid design adds the inter layer microfluidic connection to complete the three-dimensional system.

  abstract = {Wetting and electrowetting (EW) on corrugated substrates are studied experimentally and theoretically in this paper. On corrugated substrates, because of the anisotropy of surface morphology, the droplet shows an elliptical shape and the spreading velocities in different directions are different. Spreading of a droplet is usually controlled not only by the surface tensions but also by hemi-wicking. Our experimental results indicated that liquids along the grooves propagate much faster than those in the direction vertical to the grooves. However, spreading in both directions obeys the same scaling law of l∼t4∕5. EW on corrugated substrates reveals some differences with that on smooth surfaces. The change of contact angles with an applied voltage follows a linear relationship in two stages instead of the smooth curve on flat surfaces. There exists a critical voltage which divides the two stages. The transition of a droplet from the Cassie state to the Wenzel state on corrugated substrates was also discussed. The extended EW equation was derived with the free energy minimization approach, and the anisotropic factor was introduced. From the extended equation, it is found that EW is affected by the anisotropic factor significantly. For the smooth surfaces, the extended EW equation will degenerate to the classical Lippmann-Young equation. Our research may help us to understand the wetting and EW of droplets on corrugated substrates and assist in their design for practical applications.},

Largest contact angle change of 74deg (from 141degto67deg) is achieved on top of a Parylene film. Highly reversible electrowetting with very low hysteresis (2-4deg) is demonstrated on the Teflon®-coated surfaces. The actuation voltage for 30deg contact angle change (from 148degto118deg) is largely reduced to 25V by using a high-dielectric-constant tantalum oxide film as the dielectric layer. The effect of trapped charges in the dielectric film on the electrowetting is observed and measured. The rise and fall times of the electrowetting actuation are inversely proportional to the droplet diameter and as short as 0.1-0.2ms for a 50μmdia droplet. The actuation reliability is tested, and a long-time operation is achieved in an oil environment.},

Due to this reason, researches are done constantly to improve the fabrication processes of sensors by making them more user-friendly, less time-consuming, and more cost-effective. The application of any fabrication solution that offers those advantages will have a major impact on the manufacturing of modern sensors. To address this issue, a 3D printed Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) temperature sensor is presented in this paper. The modelling and analysis of such a sensor have been performed for both aluminium and copper electrodes using COMSOL software. In total, 4 different sensing structures, 2 each for both aluminium and copper electrodes based one-port resonators, are designed and analysed for their application in temperature sensing. The resulting responses of those sensors are approximately 2.19\,MHz and 424.01\,MHz frequency ranges. The novelty lies in the possibility of mass-producing such a sensor using additive manufacturing will have a direct impact in the areas where conventional electronics cannot be utilized.},

Aiming to decrease driving voltages and improve driving effectiveness, this paper studies the modeling, simulation, and optimization of EWOD devices. The theoretical model is refined mainly in consideration of the saturation effect of the contact angle and then verified by both simulation and experiments. As a design guide to decrease the driving voltage, a theoretical criterion of droplet splitting, the most difficult one among four basic droplet manipulations, is developed and then verified by experimental results. Moreover, a novel sigmoid electrode shape is found by the optimization method based on finite element analysis and achieves better driving effectiveness and consistent bidirectional driving capability, compared with the existing electrode shapes. Taken together, this paper provides an EWOD analysis and optimization method featuring a lower voltage and a better effectiveness and opens up opportunities for optimization designs in various EWOD-based applications.},

Pyrosequencing utilizes pyrophosphate produced during nucleotide base addition to initiate a process ending with detection through a chemiluminescence reaction using firefly luciferase. The intensity of light produced during the reaction can be quantified to determine the number of bases added to the DNA strand. The logic‐based control and discrete fluid droplets of a digital microfluidic device lend themselves well to the pyrosequencing process. Bead‐bound DNA is magnetically held in a single location, and wash or reagent droplets added or split from it to circumvent product dilution. Here we discuss the dispensing, control, and magnetic manipulation of the paramagnetic beads used to hold target DNA. We also demonstrate and characterize the picoliter‐scale reaction of luciferase with adenosine triphosphate to represent the detection steps of pyrosequencing and all necessary alterations for working on this scale.},

This paper discussed the current institutional framework for planning and development in Pahang River Basin, Malaysia. This case study applied the literature background study and field survey. There is lack of provision to give a clear mandate for public participation in the local planning level and public representative could not be guaranteed in the local planning committee. Based on this Pahang River Basin case study, this paper further argues that the participation of local community needs to be strengthened from consultation level to the involvement level. This could be approached through joint management concept. Integrated approach on water resources management of river basin requires a full commitment from all levels of stakeholders. However, the understanding of the characteristics of the river basin both from the natural and human system aspects could not be neglected in planning and development process.},

  abstract = {The steady increase in global consumption puts a strain on agriculture and might lead to a decrease in food quality. Currently used techniques of food analysis are often labour-intensive and time-consuming and require extensive sample preparation. For that reason, there is a demand for novel methods that could be used for rapid food quality assessment. A technique based on the use of an array of chemical sensors for holistic analysis of the sample’s headspace is called electronic olfaction. In this article, a prototype of a portable, modular electronic nose intended for food analysis is described. Using the SVM method, it was possible to classify samples of poultry meat based on shelf-life with 100\% accuracy, and also samples of rapeseed oil based on the degree of thermal degradation with 100\% accuracy. The prototype was also used to detect adulterations of extra virgin olive oil with rapeseed oil with 82\% overall accuracy. Due to the modular design, the prototype offers the advantages of solutions targeted for analysis of specific food products, at the same time retaining the flexibility of application. Furthermore, its portability allows the device to be used at different stages of the production and distribution process.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Droplet control through the use of light-induced thermocapillary effects has recently garnered attention due to its non-intrusive and multifunctional nature. An important issue in droplet control is the estimation of the thermocapillary force. The purpose of the present study is to estimate the thermocapillary force and propose empirical equations between the force and simply measurable key parameters such as droplet diameter and power of heat source. In addition, we aim to shift the droplet trajectory and develop an on-demand droplet routing system based on the estimation of the thermocapillary force. We illuminated a continuous phase with a 532\,nm laser beam to minimize possible damage or property changes to target molecules contained within droplets. A mixture of light-absorbing material and oleic acid was used for the continuous phase fluid, while deionized water (DI water) was used for the dispersed phase fluid. We proposed empirical equations to estimate the thermocapillary force, which was then applied to precise droplet shifting and routing. We found that the shifting distance was linearly proportional to the thermocapillary force, and that an on-demand droplet routing system resulted in a success rate greater than 95\%.},

  abstract = {Fast advancements of microfabrication processes in past two decades have reached to a fairly matured stage that we can manufacture a wide range of microfluidic devices. At present, the main challenge is the control of nanoscale properties on the surface of lab-on-a-chip to satisfy the need for biomedical applications. For example, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) is a commonly used material for microfluidic circuitry, yet the hydrophobic nature of PDMS surface suffers serious nonspecific protein adsorption. Thus the current major efforts are focused on surface molecular property treatments for satisfying specific needs in handling macro functional molecules. Reviewing surface modifications of all types of materials used in microfluidics will be too broad. This review will only summarize recent advances in nonbiofouling PDMS surface modification strategies applicable to microfluidic technology and classify them into two main categories: (1) physical approach including physisorption of charged or amphiphilic polymers and copolymers, as well as (2) chemical approach including self assembled monolayer and thick polymer coating. Pros and cons of a collection of available yet fully exploited surface modification methods are briefly compared among subcategories.},

  abstract = {Acoustofluidics, the integration of acoustics and microfluidics, is a rapidly growing research field that is addressing challenges in biology, medicine, chemistry, engineering, and physics. In particular, acoustofluidic separation of biological targets from complex fluids has proven to be a powerful tool due to the label-free, biocompatible, and contact-free nature of the technology. By carefully designing and tuning the applied acoustic field, cells and other bioparticles can be isolated with high yield, purity, and biocompatibility. Recent advances in acoustofluidics, such as the development of automated, point-of-care devices for isolating sub-micron bioparticles, address many of the limitations of conventional separation tools. More importantly, advances in the research lab are quickly being adopted to solve clinical problems. In this review article, we discuss working principles of acoustofluidic separation, compare different approaches of acoustofluidic separation, and provide a synopsis of how it is being applied in both traditional applications, such as blood component separation, cell washing, and fluorescence activated cell sorting, as well as emerging applications, including circulating tumor cell and exosome isolation.},

  abstract = {Electrically-driven droplet-based digital microfluidics analog to integrated chips has undergone tremendous growth; however, its applications are restricted due to high-voltage requirement and lack of versatile droplet manipulation methods. We propose liquid dielectrophoresis on electret (L-DEPOE) as a CMOS-driven general droplet manipulation method for various conductive or dielectric droplets. By mimicking electric relays to operate the electret as a virtual voltage source with a low-voltage signal, L-DEPOE dramatically reduces the driving voltage to only 5 VDC for transporting oil droplets. The driving force in liquid dielectrophoresis (L-DEP) is compared with dielectrophoresis (DEP) and electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) in a unified approach by introducing the concept of electropolarization in non-uniform electric fields. In this scenario, molecular electropolarization forces act in dielectric liquid bulk for L-DEP, in the electrical double layer (EDL) near the three-phase contact line for EWOD. The vanishing of electropolarization forces may contribute to the contact angle (CA) saturation in EWOD. The apparent CA reduction in EWOD is formulated within the classical electromechanical framework as a consequence of electropolarization forces in the EDL. To electrically manipulate various liquids, we transported both conductive water and dielectric oil droplets in the same L-DEPOE configuration using external voltages, and we propose a modified configuration for tuning liquid shapes. Improved results on electret charge stability are presented, and approaches to enhance electret performances and droplet motion velocity are analyzed based on qualitative analysis and quantitative simulation.},

By employing electret as a virtual voltage source embedded into microfluidics for the first time, a dielectric droplet between two electrodes can be transported by liquid dielectrophoresis (L-DEP) force when switching an external capacitor between electrodes using a manual switch or low-voltage-driven relays. A circuit model and force analysis for L-DEPOE are established to clarify its working principle and quantitatively depict the droplet motion. Nanoliter dielectric droplets have been transported reversibly between the two electrodes with a manual switch or five DCV-driven relays in microfabricated proof-of-concept prototypes. The surface voltage stability of electret in liquid is examined with different polymer materials and coatings. Furthermore, the droplet motion traces in a L-DEPOE device are compared with numerical simulation results, indicating the important role of contact angle hysteresis for nanoliter droplets.},

This review critically critiques the state-of-the-art designs of microfluidic devices and their applications in food processing, and identifies the key research trends and future research directions for maximizing the value of microfluidic technology. Capillary, planar, and terrace droplet generation systems are currently used in the design of microfluidic devices, each with their strengths and weaknesses as applied in food processing, for emulsification, food safety measurements, and bioactive compound extraction. Conventional channel-based microfluidic devices are prone to clogging, and have high labor costs and low productivity, and their “directional pressure” restricts scaling-up capabilities. These disadvantages can be overcome by using “inside-out centrifugal force” and the new generation continuous flow thin-film microfluidic Vortex Fluidic Device (VFD) which facilitates translating laboratory processing into commercial products.

Each receiving LC circuit connected to the EWOD/DEP electrode is designed to have a different resonant frequency. When the input frequency is close to one of the resonant frequencies of receiving LC circuits, the induced voltage on the corresponding EWOD/DEP electrode will increase due to the resonance. Therefore, electrodes can be selectively and sequentially activated to provide sufficient EWOD or DEP force to manipulate the droplet or liquid by modulating the input frequency. Unlike previously reported wireless EWOD or DEP devices powered through one-to-one transmitter–receiver coupling, the transmitting inductor in the one-to-many transmitter–receiver coupling design proposed here is much larger than the total sizes of receiving inductors. Therefore, receiving inductors can be easily covered and coupled by the transmitting inductor. Here, droplet transport, splitting, and merging are successfully demonstrated using 5 receiving LC circuits at different input frequencies (1210–1920 Hz). Liquid pumping with multiple electrodes by wireless DEP is also demonstrated using 5 receiving LC circuits at higher input frequencies (51.2–76.1 kHz). Furthermore, liquid pumping with a continuous meandered electrode by wireless DEP is demonstrated through the resonant frequency shifting effect. It shows that the liquid pumping distance on a continuous electrode also can be tuned by proper frequency modulation.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear microfluidics, including the typical devices, their working mechanisms and applications are discussed.           ,                             The microfluidic flow is typically laminar due to the dominant viscous effects. At Reynolds numbers far below 1 (Re ≪ 1), the fluid inertia can be neglected. For the steady flow of incompressible Newtonian fluids, it approaches linear Stokes flow. At intermediate Re, there exists a weak-inertia flow regime where secondary flows such as Dean vortices are accessible for microfluidic manipulations. Apart from the fluid inertia, other nonlinear factors such as the non-Newtonian fluid properties, concurrent flow of dissimilar fluids, compliant fluidic structures and stimuli-responsive materials can also cause intriguing flow behaviours. Through proper designs, they can be applied for a variety of microfluidic components including mixers, valves, oscillators, stabilizers and auto-regulators               etc.               , greatly enriching the microfluidic flow control and manipulation strategies. Due to its unique working characteristics and advantages, nonlinear microfluidics has increasingly attracted extensive attention. This review presents a systematic survey on this subject. The designs of typical nonlinear microfluidic devices, their working mechanisms, key applications, and the perspective of their future developments will be discussed. The nonlinear microfluidic techniques are believed to play an essential role in the next generation of highly-integrated, automated, and intelligent microfluidics.},

  abstract = {Digital Microfluidic Biochip (DMFB) has drawn lots of attention today. It offers a promising platform for various kinds of biochemical experiments. DMFB that uses crossreferencing technology to drive droplets movements scales down the control pin number on chip, which not only brings down manufacturing cost but also allows large-scale chip design. However, the cross-referencing scheme that imposes different voltage on rows and columns to activate the cells, might cause severe electrode interference, and hence greatly decreases the degree of parallelism of droplet routing. Most of the previous papers get a directaddressing result first, and then convert to cross-referencing compatible result. This paper proposes a new method that solves the droplet routing problem on cross-referencing biochip directly. Experimental results on public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method in comparison with the latest work on this problem.},

Under the optimum experimental conditions, CG/PPy/CS/GCE exhibited excellent differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) response of nitrite. A linear relationship between DPV peak current and the concentration of nitrite was obtained in the range of 0.2 to 1000 μM. The limit of detection of nitrite was estimated to be 0.02 μM.

In this paper, we solve the placement and droplet routing problem in cross-referencing biochips. In these biochips, the electrodes are addressed in a row-column manner, which may cause electrode interference that prevents simultaneous movements of multiple droplets. We propose a routing algorithm that solves the droplet routing problem directly. A two-coloring graph-theoretic method is used in our router to detect and prevent the electrode interference. In addition, we propose an integer linear programming based method to solve the placement problem. Our method considers the characteristics of cross-referencing biochips and is aware of droplet routing. Real-life benchmarks are used to evaluate the proposed methods. Compared with previous works, our router improves on average 4\% in routing time and 58\% in runtime. It can route all the benchmarks within the time limits, while the latest work fails in some cases. Moreover, experimental results show that by running our router on the placement result generated by our method and those generated by the latest work, an average improvement of 11\%, 29\%, 54\%, and 46\% in the maximum routing time, average routing time, stalling steps, and cell usage can be achieved.},

Here, we have developed an acoustic droplet system for rapid and efficient biological detection and chemical screening. By employing acoustic wave devices, rapid and nondestructive uniform mixing of ∼nL−μL droplets can be achieved. By the acoustophoretic force, the perturbation of the droplets can quickly concentrate the sample and increase the detection limit by five times. Through the color reaction and the coordinated detection of photodiodes, we have developed a biomarker detection protocol with short reaction time and high accuracy. As a proof-of-concept application, we demonstrated that this system can detect ultrasmall or low-abundance samples faster and more accurately, highlighting its wide application in analytical chemistry, basic research, and clinical medicine.},

  abstract = {Bacterial infections often result in severe health conditions, including infectious shock, sepsis, and multi-organ dysfunction, posing significant diagnostic and treatment challenges. Therefore, a rapid, multiplexed identification is urgently needed to accurately detect a broad spectrum of bacteria, guiding precise antibiotic prescriptions. Here, we introduce a cost-effective digital microfluidic platform designed for multiplexed detection of bacterial infections, which is referred to as MiND-DMF. This system integrates DNA extraction, RPA amplification, and CRISPR-based bacterial detection, enabling the efficient identification of six infectious bacteria: E. coli, S. aureus, MRSA, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae. The entire diagnostic process is completed in just 55 minutes at 37°C and is compatible with human reference genes. MiND-DMF exhibits robust anti-interference capabilities, making it ideal for detecting bacteria in different tissue fluids. In spiked samples, the platform demonstrated a detection limit of 100 CFU/mL, highlighting its great sensitivity and quantification capability. In clinical evaluations, MiND-DMF achieved 100\% sensitivity and 98-100\% specificity compared to the hospital's gold-standard method. The system analyzed 50 samples from various tissue sources, accurately pinpointing the bacteria responsible for infections. This information guides the administration of appropriate antibiotic treatment. Notably, K.pneumoniae and P.aeruginosa are the leading causes of nosocomial infections in ICU, with K.pneumoniae commonly associated with urinary tract infections and E.coli frequently isolated from appendiceal pus. Additionally, H.influenzae primarily affects children under 5-years-old. MiND-DMF’s efficiency and precision support monitoring the origins of hospital-acquired bacterial infections, assisting physicians in prescribing targeted antibiotics and enhancing infection prevention and control strategies.},

However, concerns for digital microfluidic platforms based on low-cost printed circuit boards, such as the scalability of the electrode array and the reliability of the device operation, should be addressed before high throughput and fully automatic applications can be realized. In this work we report the progress in addressing those issues by using active-matrix circuitry to automatically drive a large electrode array with enhanced device reliability. We describe the design and the fabrication of a robust and scalable active-matrix driven digital microfluidic platform based on printed-circuit board technology. Reliable actuation of aqueous and organic droplets is achieved using a free-standing double-layer hydrophobic membrane. To demonstrate the versatility of the digital microfluidic platform, a pentapeptide is synthesized on the device within 30 minutes. With these improvements, a fully automatic, scalable, robust, reusable, and low-cost digital microfluidic platform capable of parallel manipulation of a large number of droplets can find numerous applications in chemical engineering, bioengineering and biomedical engineering.},

We introduce the concept of design-for-testability (DFT) for microfluidic biochips and propose a DFT method that incorporates a test plan into the fluidic operations of a target bioassay protocol. By using the testability-aware bioassay protocol as an input to the biochip design tool, the proposed DFT method ensures a high level of testability, defined as the percentage of the electrodes or functional units on the synthesized chip that can be effectively tested. We evaluate the DFT method using a representative multiplexed bioassay and the polymerase chain reaction.},

  abstract = {Gray scale consistency in pixels was extremely important for electrowetting displays (EWDs). However, traditional electrowetting display driving waveforms could not obtain a pixel aperture ratio consistency, which led to the occurrence of gray inconsistency even if it was the same driving waveform. In addition, the oil backflow caused by charge trapping could not be sustained. Therefore, a multi-direct current (DC) overdriving waveform for gray scale consistency was proposed in this paper, which could effectively improve the performance of EWDs. The driving waveform was divided into a start-up driving phase and a stable driving phase. The stable driving phase was composed of a square wave with a duty cycle of 79\% and a frequency of 43 Hz. Subsequently, an overdriving pulse was also introduced in the stable driving phase. The multi-DC driving waveform for gray scale consistency was applied to a thin film transistor-electrowetting display (TFT-EWD). The average difference between increasing driving voltage and decreasing driving voltage was only 2.79\%. The proposed driving waveform has an aperture ratio of 3.7 times at low voltages compared to DC driving.},

As high-throughput bioassays are mapped to digital microfluidic platforms, the need for design automation techniques for pin-constrained biochips is being increasingly felt. However, most prior work on biochips computer-aided design has assumed independent control of the underlying electrodes using a large number of (electrical) input pins. We propose a dropletmanipulation method based on a “cross-referencing” addressing method that uses “row” and “columns” to access electrodes. By mapping the droplet-movement problem on a crossreferenced chip to the clique-partitioning problem from graph theory, the proposed method allows simultaneous movement of a large number of droplets on a microfluidic array. Concurrency is enhanced through the use of an efficient scheduling algorithm that determines the order in which groups of droplets are moved. The proposed design-automation method facilitates high-throughput applications on a pin-constrained biochip, and it is evaluated using random synthetic benchmarks and a set of multiplexed bioassays.},

Most prior work on CAD for biochips has assumed independent control of electrodes using a large number of (electrical) input pins. Such solutions are not feasible for low-cost disposable biochips that are envisaged for many field applications. A more promising design strategy is to divide the microfluidic array into smaller partitions and use a small number of electrodes to control the electrodes in each partition. We propose a partitioning algorithm based on the concept of “droplet trace”, which is extracted from the scheduling and droplet routing results produced by a synthesis tool. An efficient pin assignment method, referred to as the “Connect-5 algorithm”, is combined with the array partitioning technique based on droplet traces. The array partitioning and pin assignment methods are evaluated using a set of multiplexed bioassays.},

  abstract = {In-field screening of foodborne pathogens plays an important role in ensuring food safety. Thus, a microfluidic biosensor was developed for rapid and sensitive detection of Salmonella using manganese dioxide nanoflowers (MnO2 NFs) for amplifying the biological signal, a microfluidic chip with a convergence−divergence spiral micromixer for performing automatic operations, and a smartphone app with a saturation calculation algorithm for processing the image. First, immune magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), the sample, and immune MnO2 NFs were fully mixed and sufficiently incubated in the spiral micromixer to form MNP−bacteria−MnO2 sandwich complexes, which were magnetically captured in a separation chamber in the microfluidic chip. Then, a 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate was injected and catalyzed by a MnO2 NF nanomimetic enzyme on the complexes, resulting in the production of yellow catalysate. Finally, the catalysate was transferred into a detection chamber and its image was measured and processed using the smartphone app to determine the number of bacteria. This biosensor was able to detect Salmonella from 4.4 × 101 to 4.4 × 106 CFU/mL in 45 min with a detection limit of 44 CFU/mL, and has the potential to provide a promising platform for on-site detection of foodborne bacteria.},

Therefore, these devices must be adequately tested after manufacture and during bioassay operations. Known techniques for biochip testing are all function oblivious (i.e., while they can detect and locate defect sites on a microfluidic array, they cannot be used to ensure correct operation of functional units). In this paper, we introduce the concept of functional testing of microfluidic biochips. We address fundamental biochip operations, such as droplet dispensing, droplet transportation, mixing, splitting, and capacitive sensing. Long electrode actuation times are avoided to ensure that there is no electrode degradation during testing. The functional testing of pin-constrained biochips is also studied. We evaluate the proposed test methods using simulations as well as experiments for a fabricated biochip.},

As high-throughput bioassays are mapped to digital microfluidic platforms, the need for design automation techniques is being increasingly felt. Moreover, as most applications of biochips are safety-critical in nature, defect tolerance is an essential system attribute. Several synthesis tools have recently been proposed for the automated design of biochips from the specifications of laboratory protocols. However, only a few of these tools address the problem of defect tolerance. In addition, most of these methods do not consider the problem of droplet routing in microfluidic arrays. These methods typically rely on postsynthesis droplet routing to implement biochemical protocols. Such an approach is not only time consuming, but also imposes an undue burden on the chip user. Postsynthesis droplet routing does not guarantee that feasible droplet pathways can be found for area-constrained biochip layouts; nonroutable fabricated biochips must be discarded. We present a synthesis tool that integrates defect tolerance and droplet routing in the design flow. Droplet routability, defined as the ease with which droplet pathways can be determined, is estimated and integrated in the synthesis procedure. Presynthesis and postsynthesis defect-tolerance methods are also presented. We use a large-scale protein assay as a case study to evaluate the proposed synthesis method.},

This facilitates the DMF electrodes’ fabrication process by eliminating many microfabrication steps. An electrowetting test was performed to investigate the effectiveness of the LSG DMF electrodes in changing the contact angles of droplets. Different DMF operations were successfully performed using the proposed LSG DMF chips in both open and closed DMF systems. The quality and output resolution were examined to assess the performance of such patterned electrodes in the DMF systems. To verify the efficacy of the LSG DMF chips, a one-step direct assay for the detection of Legionella pneumophila deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was performed on the chip without the need for any washing step. The high specificity in distinguishing a single-nucleotide mismatch was achieved by detecting target DNA concentrations as low as 1 nM. Our findings suggest that the proposed rapid and easy fabrication method for LSG DMF electrodes offers a great platform for low-cost and easily accessible point-of-care diagnostic devices.},

  abstract = {Advanced thermal management methods have been the key issues for the rapid development of the electronic industry following Moore’s law. Droplet-based microfluidic cooling technologies are considered as promising solutions to conquer the major challenges of high heat flux removal and nonuniform temperature distribution in confined spaces for high performance electronic devices. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art droplet-based microfluidic cooling methods in the literature, including the basic theory of electrocapillarity, cooling applications of continuous electrowetting (CEW), electrowetting (EW) and electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD), and jumping droplet microfluidic liquid handling methods. The droplet-based microfluidic cooling methods have shown an attractive capability of microscale liquid manipulation and a relatively high heat flux removal for hot spots. Recommendations are made for further research to develop advanced liquid coolant materials and the optimization of system operation parameters.},

  abstract = {An electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) device that enhances water capturing capability for condensation applications is presented. A single planar EWOD device is fabricated for testing and placed in a high-humidity environment under mist flow. By applying an electric field to portions of the device, the wettability of the affected areas is altered from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, which promotes droplet nucleation and growth, thereby improving water capturing capability. The results of this study demonstrate that droplet coalescence is appreciably improved at the moments of plugging and unplugging DC voltage, which induces wipe-down events (when a droplet drips down the surface and removes all droplets underneath it). The improvement in water capturing capability under DC voltages of 20\,V, 40\,V, and 60\,V is also investigated both by comparing the mass of water collected on uncharged and charged devices during the same testing period and by using an image processing approach to track changes in droplet area coverage over time. The EWOD effect was shown to improve water capturing capability for the 20\,V, 40\,V, and 60\,V cases by 138.96\%, 171.87\%, and 220.43\%, respectively. These results are of great significance as they indicate a strong possibility for improvement in water harvesting applications.},

It is necessary to regularly detect microorganisms in food and environment to prevent infection of pathogenic microorganisms. However, most traditional detection methods are expensive, time-consuming, and unfeasible in practice in the absence of sophisticated instruments and trained operators. Point-of-care testing (POCT) can be used to detect microorganisms rapidly on site and greatly improve the efficiency of microbial detection. Lab-on-chip (LOC) is an emerging POCT technology with great potential by integrating most of the experimental steps carried out in the laboratory into a single monolithic device. This review will primarily focus on principles and techniques of LOC for detection of microbial nucleic acid in food and environment, including sample preparation, nucleic acid amplification and sample detection.},

  abstract = {Electro-catalytic technology is a promising approach for wastewater treatment, owing to its easy operation, minimal generation of secondary pollution, small foot-print and rapid start-up. In this work, the chlorine evolution potential of the Pd-Sn modified ruthenium(Ru)-iridium(Ir) electrode was investigated for the electro-catalytic treatment of high chlorine ammonia-nitrogen wastewater. The effect of reaction conditions on the removal of ammonia-nitrogen, kinetics and apparent activation energy of ammonia-nitrogen removal were studied. The possible denitrification process of high chlorine ammonia-nitrogen wastewater was discussed. The results indicated that the chlorine evolution potential of the Pd-Sn modified Ru-Ir electrode was 1.0956 V(vs. SCE). The electro-catalytic treatment of high chlorine ammonia-nitrogen conformed to zero-order kinetic law, and the apparent activation energy of removal process was 14.089 kJ/ mol. With a current was 0.5 A, the removal efficiency of ammonia-nitrogen could achieve 100\% at a reaction time of 40 min. Indirect oxidation played an essential role in the electro-catalytic ammonia-nitrogen removal using the Pd-Sn modified Ru-Ir electrode. This paper demonstrated that the electro-catalytic technology was a promising approach for efficiently treating the high chlorine ammonia-nitrogen wastewater.},

When an air-to-water interface is vertically oscillated by ac-EWOD, two different surface waves and underwater flows are generated depending upon the applied frequency. The effects of the frequency are investigated by flow visualization techniques and confirmed by numerical calculations. The results reveal that at a low frequency (1 Hz), the oscillating flows with quasistatic waves are dominant without generating net momentum, whereas at a high frequency (50 Hz), the quasisteady flows with travelling waves are dominant with the generation of net momentum capable of being used for micropropulsion.},

  abstract = {The early diagnosis of infectious diseases is critical because it can greatly increase recovery rates and prevent the spread of diseases such as COVID-19; however, in many areas with insufficient medical facilities, the timely detection of diseases is challenging. Conventional medical testing methods require specialized laboratory equipment and well-trained operators, limiting the applicability of these tests. Microfluidic point-of-care (POC) equipment can rapidly detect diseases at low cost. This technology could be used to detect diseases in underdeveloped areas to reduce the effects of disease and improve quality of life in these areas. This review details microfluidic POC equipment and its applications. First, the concept of microfluidic POC devices is discussed. We then describe applications of microfluidic POC devices for infectious diseases, cardiovascular diseases, tumors (cancer), and chronic diseases, and discuss the future incorporation of microfluidic POC devices into applications such as wearable devices and telemedicine. Finally, the review concludes by analyzing the present state of the microfluidic field, and suggestions are made. This review is intended to call attention to the status of disease treatment in underdeveloped areas and to encourage the researchers of microfluidics to develop standards for these devices.},

Such mobile sensing based on microfluidic devices (broadly defined) and smartphones (MS               2               ) offers a mobile laboratory for performing a wide range of bio-chemical detection and analysis functions such as water and food quality analysis, routine health tests and disease diagnosis. MS               2               offers significant advantages over traditional platforms in terms of test speed and control, low cost, mobility, ease-of-operation and data management. These improvements put MS               2               in a promising position in the fields of interdisciplinary basic and applied research. In particular, MS               2               enables applications to remote in-field testing, homecare, and healthcare in low-resource areas.

  abstract = {Digital microfluidics is a plausible platform for manipulation of discrete droplets, which are driven by electrowetting and dielectrophoretic forces. Increasing the sustainability of DMF chips while reducing their fabrication cost would be attractive to research on droplet-based micro-actuators. Here, we report a new robust composite layer, with which a broad range of its operation voltage of DMF chips was demonstrated, covering from 30 V, which was 25 V below the theoretical value predicted with scaling model that derived from d/ε, to at least 350 V with a minimum dispensing voltage at 100 V. Also, a lifetime of at least 5000 continuous cycles at 110 volts was achieved. Deposition of such a composite layer was solely accomplished with a low-cost spincoater, instead of expensive vapour deposition instruments. And the materials we used were cheap as well. The electromechanical force, which was expressed in separate terms of electrowetting force and dielectrophoretic force on a droplet, in six chips with different values of d/ε were calculated and compared. The result from our calculation showed that, differently from lowd/ε DMF chips, there was considerable electrowetting factor among the electromechanical force in the high-d/ε DMF chips and it may be the cause that the initial apparent actuation voltage was much lower than theoretical threshold actuation voltage.},

It is structured with a switched-capacitor capacitance-to-current front-end interface, followed by a differential current-mode SAR analog-to-digital converter (ADC). By using subthreshold-biased transistors, the differential current-mode SAR ADC significantly saves power and reduces sensitivity to supply voltage and clock variation.

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic biochips are gaining increasing attention with promising applications for automating and miniaturizing laboratory procedures in biochemistry. In digital microfluidic biochips, cross-contamination of droplets with different biomolecules is a major issue, which causes significant errors in bioassays. Washing operations are introduced to clean the cross-contamination spots. However, existing works have oversimplified assumptions on the washing behavior, which either assume infinite washing capacity, or ignore the routing conflicts between functional and washing droplets. This paper proposes the first integrated functional and washing droplet routing flow, which considers practical issues including the finite washing capacity constraint, and the routing conflicts between functional and washing droplets. Washing droplets of different sizes are also proposed to wash the congested cross-contamination spots. Effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by real-life biochemical applications.},

  abstract = {Salmonella is a main cause of foodborne illnesses and rapid screening of Salmonella is the key to prevent Salmonella outbreaks, however available detection methods either require a long time, or need complex pretreatment, or have low sensitivity. In this study, a microfluidic biosensor was developed for Salmonella detection using viscoelastic inertial microfluidics for separating magnetic bacteria from unbound magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and enzyme catalytic colorimetry for amplifying biological signals. The polyclonal antibodies and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) modified MNPs were first used to specifically capture Salmonella to form magnetic HRP-bacteria. Both magnetic HRP-bacteria and unbound MNPs were magnetically separated from background and resuspended in viscoelastic polyvinylpyrrolidone solution as sample flow. When sample flow was injected with polyvinylpyrrolidone sheath flow into a T-shaped microchannel, larger-sized magnetic HRP-bacteria could penetrate the sample flow, however smaller-sized MNPs remained in the sample flow due to weaker inertial lift force and elastic lift force, resulting in continuous-flow separation of magnetic HRP-bacteria. Finally, magnetic HRP-bacteria were collected and concentrated to catalyze tetramethyl benzidine, and absorbance was measured to determine the bacteria. This biosensor was able to detect Salmonella as low as 30 CFU/mL in 1 h and featured the advantages of shorter time due to a one-step immunoreaction, easier extension due to only one antibody and one label, and lower cost due to less expensive materials.},

Several experimental results showed that a decrease in SiO2 thickness reduces the minimum required voltage, and that an application of square-wave voltage permits lower voltage transportation of a droplet than that of DC voltage. Also, droplet velocity depended on frequency of an applied square-wave voltage, and the velocity of a 15 μl deionized (DI) water droplet reached the maximum at 60 Hz.},

Here, the study presents a lidless Si‐based capillary‐driven microfluidic device, comprising two inlets for sample and buffer loading, a snake‐shaped microchannel (120/0.05/0.025~mm in length/width/depth) as a flow resistor, a micropillar array (25/5/8 μm in height/diameter/pitch) as a capillary pump and a vent. It was fabricated with lithographic technique in combination with deep Si etch technique. A simple and stable surface hydrophilisation modification method was demonstrated on the device by forming a self‐assembly monolayer through Cu‐catalysed azide‐alkyne cycloaddition reaction. The surface modified device allowed controllable autonomous capillary flow delivery with a contact angle of around 40° stabilised for at least 90~days. The design of two inlets with one common long snake‐shaped microchannel provided the sequential capillary flow generation and propagation with controlled flow rate and propagation distance, while the micropillar array with a high aspect ratio of 5 was considered as an effective capillary pump.

  abstract = {Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) chips have become the most promising technology to realize pin-constrained digital microfluidic biochips (PDMFBs). In the design flow of EWOD chips, reliability is a critical challenge as it directly affects execution of bioassays. The major factor to degrade chip reliability is the trapped charge problem, which is induced by excessive applied voltage. Nevertheless, to comply with the pin constraint for PDMFBs, signal merging is inevitably involved, and thereby incurring trapped charges due to unawareness of applied voltage. Except for the trapped charge problem, wire routing to accomplish electrical connections increases the design complexity of pin-constrained EWOD chips. Unfortunately, no existing works tackle the problems of excessive applied voltage and wire routing, and thus the resultant chip will have more probabilities to fail during execution or can not be realized because of wire routing problem. In this paper, we present a network-flow based algorithm for reliabilitydriven pin-constrained EWOD chips with the consideration of voltage issue. Our algorithm not only minimizes the reliability problem induced by signal merging but also provides a comprehensive routing solution for EWOD chiplevel designs. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed algorithm on real-life chips.},

Front-end operations such as sample preparation play a pivotal role in biochemical laboratories, and in applications in biomedical engineering and life science. For fast and high-throughput biochemical applications, preparing samples of multiple target concentrations sequentially is inefficient and time-consuming. Therefore, it is critical to concurrently prepare samples of multiple target concentrations. In addition, since reagents used in biochemical reactions are expensive, reagent-saving has become an important consideration in sample preparation. Prior work in this area does not address the problem of reagentsaving and concurrent sample preparation for multiple target concentrations. In this paper, we propose the first reagent-saving mixing algorithm for biochemical samples of multiple target concentrations. The proposed algorithm not only minimizes the consumption of reagents, but it also reduces the number of waste droplets and the sample preparation time by preparing the target concentrations concurrently. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on both real biochemical experiments and synthetic test cases to demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency. Compared to prior work, the proposed algorithm can achieve up to 41\% reduction in the number of reagent droplets and waste droplets, and up to 50\% reduction in sample preparation time.},

However, current methods with a single ultrasonic transducer offer limited control of the position of single particles. In this paper, we demonstrate closed-loop two-dimensional manipulation of particles inside closed-channel microfluidic chips, by controlling the frequency of a single ultrasound transducer, based on machine-vision-measured positions of the particles. For the control task, we propose using algorithms derived from the family of multi-armed bandit algorithms. We show that these algorithms can achieve controlled manipulation with no prior information on the acoustic field shapes. The method learns as it goes: there is no need to restart the experiment at any point. Starting with no knowledge of the field shapes, the algorithms can (eventually) move a particle from one position inside the chamber to another. This makes the method very robust to changes in chip and particle properties. We demonstrate that the method can be used to manipulate a single particle, three particles simultaneously, and also a single particle in the presence of a bubble in the chip. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applications of this method in active sorting of particles, by guiding each particle to exit the chip through one of three different outlets at will. Because the method requires no model or calibration, the work paves the way toward the acoustic manipulation of microparticles inside unstructured environments.},

The algorithm has no prior knowledge of the acoustic fields but learns to control the droplets on the fly. The manipulation is based on switching the frequency of a single ultrasonic transducer. Using this method, we demonstrate 2D transportation and merging of water droplets in oil and oil droplets in water, and we performed the chemistry that underlies the basis of a colorimetric glucose assay. We show that we can manipulate drops with volumes ranging from ∼200 pL up to ∼30 nL with our setup. We also demonstrate that our method is robust, by changing the system parameters and showing that the machine learning algorithm can still complete the manipulation tasks.

  abstract = {In recent years, the open electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) device has been widely used in biomedical detection, chemical synthesis analysis, and so on. However, the cost of using ITO glass as surface material is difficult to meet the requirement for large-scale array chip production. So, a low-cost, easy-to-manufacture open EWOD platform is designed in this paper. In hardware platform, an operation platform is prepared by using a printed circuit board (PCB) as a substrate. The electrode shape is designed as zigzag, and its surface is optimized by organic solderability preservatives (OSP). In addition, Parafilm M and silicone oil are used as a dielectric hydrophobic layer to prepare the open platform. In software, the system program is designed by C programming language, including initialization program, serial port communication program, high-voltage output port program, and interrupt program, which can be used to drive droplets. The system can achieve an effective driving voltage of 180–240 V. The moving speed of droplets can reach 15 mm/s when the droplet volume is 1850 µL and the electrode voltage output frequency is 10 Hz.},

The intelligent ammonia sensor integrates ammonia electrode, pH electrode and Ammonia Ion electrode together to realize the in situ detection of ammonia. The test results have shown that the sensor is easy operation, low cost and no pollution. The ammonia is determined potentiometrically using an ammonia ion selective electrode and a pH/mV meter, having an expanded millivolt scale. The ammonia selective electrode uses a hydrophobic gas-permeable membrane to separate the sample solution from an electrode internal solution of ammonium chloride. Dissolved ammonia is converted to NH3 gas by raising the pH to above 11.0 with a strong base. NH3 gas diffuses the membrane and changes the internal solution pH that is sensed by the electrode. In single laboratory test results have been found 1.001 NH3-/L and 0.897 mg NH3-N/L, recoveries were 77.3\% and 83.1\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {An integrated multiplex dRPA chip for rapid and accurate detection of foodborne bacteria.           ,              Point-of-care (POC) testing offers rapid diagnostic results. However, the quantification of current methods is performed using standard curves and external references, and not direct and absolute quantification. This paper describes an integrated multiplex digital recombinase polymerase amplification (ImdRPA) microfluidic chip which combines DNA extraction, multiplex digital RPA and fluorescence detection together in one chip, creating a “sample-in-multiplex-digital-answer-out” system. Multi-layer soft lithography technology was used, with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as the chip material and a glass slide as the substrate. This microfluidic chip has a six-layer structure and screw microvalve control function. The sample preparation for the chip involved magnetic bead-based nucleic acid extraction, which was completed within 15 min without any instrument dependence. The dRPA region was divided into 4 regions (3 positive detection areas and 1 negative control area) and included a total of 12\,800 chambers, with each chamber being able to contain a volume of 2.7 nL. The screw valve allowed for the reaction components of each specific goal to be pre-embedded in different regions of the chambers. The reagents were passively driven into the dRPA region using vacuum-based self-priming introduction. Furthermore, we successfully demonstrated that the chip can simultaneously detect three species of pathogenic bacteria within 45 min and give digital quantitative results without the need to establish a standard curve in contaminated milk. Moreover, the detection limit of this ImdRPA microfluidic chip was found to be 10 bacterial cells for each kind of pathogen. These characteristics enhance its applicability for rapid detection of foodborne bacteria at the point-of-care (POC). We envision that the further development of this integrated chip will lead to rapid, multiplex and accurate detection of foodborne bacteria in a feasible manner.},

In each case, a transverse electric field is used to create an electrostatic pressure, giving rise to the transport of individual liquid slugs. This paper examines the nature of the force distribution for both EWOD and DEP actuated droplets. The effects of system parameters such as contact angle and electrode length on the shape of the force density and its net integral are considered. A comparison of the scaling properties of DEP and EWOD for applications in digital microfluidics is presented. The net DEP force is shown to be strongly peaked when a droplet interface is located near the edge of a charged electrode and reduces to the well-known lumped parameter model in the appropriate limits. The effect of electrode spacing is seen to have an inversely proportional effect on the force experienced by the droplet, and the effect of increasing droplet contact angle is observed to increase the net force on the droplet.},

Anthropogenic activities have highly impacted the natural balance of the nitrogen species. Therefore, it is critical to monitor nitrogen concentrations in different environments continuously. Various methods have been explored to measure the concentration of nitrogen species in the air, soil, and water.

  abstract = {A capillary interaction between floating objects and adjacent walls, which is known as “Cheerios effect”, is a common phenomenon that generates capillary attraction or repulsion forces between them depending on their wettabilities, densities, geometries, and so on. This paper deals with controlling the capillary forces, specifically, acting on objects floating on a dielectric (nonconductive) fluid. A key control input parameter is the wettability (contact angle) of the sidewall adjacent to the floating object. By introducing dielectrowetting to the sidewall and actively changing the contact angle on the sidewall, the capillary force is controlled and easily reversed between attraction and repulsion. In this reversing process, the tilting angle of the sidewall is another critical parameter. A theoretical relation taking the titling angle into account is compared and in good agreement with experimental results obtained from the trajectory of the floating object. Finally, a continuous motion of the floating object is demonstrated using this control where an array of dielectrowetting electrode pads is sequentially activated.},

The oscillation of the free surface generates a propelling force on the centimeter-sized floating object. This paper describes a propulsion mechanism in free-surface oscillation along with its experimental results. Flow visualizations, wave patterns measured by the free-surface synthetic schlieren method, and PIV measurements show that the oscillation generates a capillary Stokes drift on the water surface and two counter-rotating spiral underwater vortices, leading to an ejecting flow (streaming flow) normal to the wall of the boat. The momentum of the ejecting flow produces a reaction force on the wall and ultimately propels the floating boat. The propulsion speed of the boat highly depends on the amplitude, frequency, and shape of the AC EWOD signal. Curve fittings based on the Stokes drift well match the experimental measurements of propulsion speed. The width of the EWOD electrode also has significant effects on the boat speed.},

One critical problem for biochip synthesis is the droplet routing problem. Unlike traditional very large scale integration routing problems, in addition to routing path selection, the biochip routing problem needs to address the issue of scheduling droplets under practical constraints imposed by the fluidic property and timing restriction of synthesis results. In this paper, we present the first network-flow-based routing algorithm that can concurrently route a set of noninterfering nets for the droplet routing problem on biochips. We adopt a two-stage technique of global routing followed by detailed routing. In global routing, we first identify a set of noninterfering nets and then adopt the network-flow approach to generate optimal global-routing paths for nets. In detailed routing, we present the first polynomial-time algorithm for simultaneous routing and scheduling using the global-routing paths with a negotiation-based routing scheme. Our algorithm targets at both the minimization of cells used for routing for better fault tolerance and minimization of droplet transportation time for better reliability and faster bioassay execution. Experimental results show the robustness and efficiency of our algorithm.},

  abstract = {This paper describes an electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) digital microfluidic-based lab-on-a-chip (LOC) integrated with on-chip electrochemical microsensor by IC compatible fabrication process, and its application for the entire online biosensing process capable of fully automatic analysis for ferrocenemethanol (FcM) and dopamine (DA). In this work, we made full use of the parallel-plate structure of the EWOD digital microfluidic device to fabricate the microfluidic module on the bottom plate and the three-microelectrode-system-integrated electrochemical cell together with patterned ground electrode on the top plate. The proposed LOC possesses the multifunction of: (1) creating, merging and transporting of microliter-level sample droplets, (2) online biosensing, and (3) droplets recycling. The three-electrodeintegrated microsensor not only reveals a sensitive electrochemical detection for FcM in a wide concentration range (10 μM–1.0 mM), but also shows good stability, selectivity and reproducibility for surface-controlled detection of DA. The calibration of DA was linear for concentration from 1.0 to 50.0 μM with a high sensitivity of 2145 nA μM−1 cm−2 (R2 = 0.9933) and estimated detection limit of 0.42 μM (signal/noise ratio of 3). This work shows the promise of state-of-the-art digital microfluidic biosensors for fully automatic online bioanalysis in a future LOC to perform on-chip biomedical protocols in vitro diagnostic assays.},

The results of the sensing test revealed that, at room temperature (20 ◦C), S-GO has the optimal sensitivity to NH3.

Theoretical models of graphene and S-doped graphene are established, and electrical properties of the graphene and S-doped graphene are calculated. The enhanced sensing performance was ascribed to the electrical properties’ improvement after the graphene was S-doped.},

  abstract = {Real-time nanoparticle separation in deterministic lateral displacement can be achieved by manipulating solution iconicity.           ,              Nanoparticles exhibit size-dependent properties which make size-selective purification of proteins, DNA or synthetic nanoparticles essential for bio-analytics, clinical medicine, nano-plasmonics and nano-material sciences. Current purification methods of centrifugation, column chromatography and continuous-flow techniques suffer from particle aggregation, multi-stage process, complex setups and necessary nanofabrication. These increase process costs and time, reduce efficiency and limit dynamic range. Here, we achieve an unprecedented real-time nanoparticle separation (51–1500 nm) using a large-pore (2 μm) deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) device. No external force fields or nanofabrication are required. Instead, we investigated innate long-range electrostatic influences on nanoparticles within a fluid medium at different NaCl ionic concentrations. In this study we account for the electrostatic forces beyond Debye length and showed that they cannot be assumed as negligible especially for precise nanoparticle separation methods such as DLD. Our findings have enabled us to develop a model to simultaneously quantify and modulate the electrostatic force interactions between nanoparticle and micropore. By simply controlling buffer solutions, we achieve dynamic nanoparticle size separation on a single device with a rapid response time ({$<$}20 s) and an enlarged dynamic range ({$>$}1200\%), outperforming standard benchtop centrifuge systems. This novel method and model combines device simplicity, isolation precision and dynamic flexibility, opening opportunities for high-throughput applications in nano-separation for industrial and biological applications.},

  abstract = {The switching of acoustic streaming vortices allows the contactless gating and routing of microliter droplets with scalability.           ,              Advances in lab-on-a-chip technologies are driven by the pursuit of programmable microscale bioreactors or fluidic processors that mimic electronic functionality, scalability, and convenience. However, few fluidic mechanisms allow for basic logic operations on rewritable fluidic paths due to cross-contamination, which leads to random interference between “fluidic bits” or droplets. Here, we introduce a mechanism that allows for contact-free gating of individual droplets based on the scalable features of acoustic streaming vortices (ASVs). By shifting the hydrodynamic equilibrium positions inside interconnected ASVs with multitonal electrical signals, different functions such as controlling the routing and gating of droplets on rewritable fluidic paths are demonstrated with minimal biochemical cross-contamination. Electrical control of this ASV-based mechanism allows for unidirectional routing and active gating behaviors, which can potentially be scaled to functional fluidic processors that can regulate the flow of droplets in a manner similar to the current in transistor arrays.},

  abstract = {Soil macronutrient monitoring is of crucial importance for fertilizer recommendation and site-specific fertilization. Compared to the conventional methods, ion-selective electrode (ISE) shows advantages on its rapid response, inexpensive cost and simple operation. In this study, two kinds of novel solid-state ISEs (S-ISEs) were manufactured and evaluated. In standard solution measurement, quasi-ideal Nernstian performances were observed on both of the monolayer and bilayer S-ISEs. Besides, S-ISEs demonstrated the faster response time of less than 30 s, which was 60\% time reduction of the conventional PVC polymeric ISE (PVC-ISE). The bilayer S-ISE illustrated more stable potential responses than the monolayer SISE in the continuous 500 s detection. In soil extract measurement, the nitrate bilayer S-ISE provided the smallest absolute error(AE) of 6.8 mg L 1 among the tested three ISEs. The potassium bilayer S-ISE generated the similar testing ability as the monolayer S-ISE and PVC-ISE. In soil slurry measurement, obvious disturbance was placed on all of the tested ISEs. Thus, the filtration was an necessary operation of soil pretreatment for the ISE-based soil detection. More soil samples of a broader geographical area should be tested for the validation of the applicability of S-ISEs.},

Most advanced fluidic handling technologies (e.g., microfluidic chips and micro-well plates) lack fluid rewritability, and the associated benefits of multi-path routing and re-programmability, due to surface-adsorption-induced contamination on contacting structures. This limits their processing speed and the complexity of reaction test matrices. We present a contactless droplet transport and processing technique called digital acoustofluidics which dynamically manipulates droplets with volumes from 1\,nL to 100\,µL along any planar axis via acoustic-streaming-induced hydrodynamic traps, all in a contamination-free (lower than 10               −10               \% diffusion into the fluorinated carrier oil layer) and biocompatible (99.2\% cell viability) manner.

  abstract = {PD1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors are at the forefront of cancer immunotherapies. However, the overall response rate remains only 10–30\%. Even among initial responders, drug resistance often occurs, which can lead to prolonged use of a futile therapy in the race with the fatal disease. It would be ideal to closely monitor key indicators of patients’ immune responsiveness, such as circulating PD-L1 levels. Traditional PD-L1 detection methods, such as ELISA, are limited in sensitivity and rely on core lab facilities, preventing their use for the regular monitoring. Electrochemical sensors exist as an attractive candidate for point-of-care tool, yet, streamlining multiple processes in a single platform remains a challenge. To overcome this challenge, this work integrated electrochemical sensor arrays into a digital microfluidic device to combine their distinct merits, so that soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) molecules can be rapidly detected in a programmed and automated manner. This new platform featured microscale electrochemical sensor arrays modified with electrically conductive 3D matrix, and can detect as low as 1 pg/mL sPD-L1 with high specificity. The sensors also have desired repeatability and can obtain reproducible results on different days. To demonstrate the functionality of the device to process more complex biofluids, we used the device to detect sPD-L1 molecules secreted by human breast cancer cell line in culture media directly and observed 2X increase in signal compared with control experiment. This novel platform holds promise for the close monitoring of sPD-L1 level in human physiological fluids to evaluate the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy.},

In contrast to conventional microfluidic technologies, where fluid inertia is negligible and flow remains almost within Stokes flow region with very low Reynolds number Re {$<<$}1, inertial microfluidics works in the intermediate Reynolds number range (\textasciitilde 1 {$<$} Re {$<$} \textasciitilde 100) between Stokes and turbulent regimes. In this intermediate range, both inertia and fluid viscosity are finite, and bring about several intriguing effects that form the basis of inertial microfluidics including: (i) inertial migration and (ii) secondary flow. Due to the superior features of high-throughput, simplicity, precise manipulation and low cost, inertial microfluidics is a very promising candidate for cellular sample processing, especially for sample with low abundant targets. In this review, we first discuss the fundamental kinematics of particles in microchannels to familiarise readers with mechanisms and underlying physics in inertial microfluidic systems. We then present a comprehensive review of recent developments and key applications of inertial microfluidic systems according to their microchannel structures. Finally, we discuss the perspective of employing fluid inertia in microfluidics for particle manipulation. Due to the superior benefits of inertial microfluidics, this promising technology will still be an attractive topic in the near future, with more novel designs and further applications in biology, medicine and industry on the horizon.},

By definition, microfluidics manipulates fluids in small channels with dimensions of tens to hundreds of micrometers. Recently, microfluidics has been greatly developed and its influence extends not only the domains of chemical synthesis, bioanalysis and medical researches but also optics and information technology. In this review article, we will shortly discuss an enlightening analogy between electrons transport in electronics and fluids transport in microfluidic channels. This analogy helps to master transport and sorting. We will present some complex microfluidic devices showing that the analogy is going a long way off toward more complex components with impressive similarities between electronics and microfluidics. We will in particular explore the vast manifold of fluidic operations with passive and active fluidic components respectively, as well as the associated mechanisms and corresponding applications.

In addition, due to the existence of inevitable human invention, the inconsistent judgment standards make the comparison between different experiments cumbersome and almost impossible. In this paper, we tried to use machine learning to build algorithms that could automatically identify, judge, and predict flow patterns and droplet characteristics, so that the empirical judgment was transferred to be an intelligent process. The difference on the usual machine learning algorithms, a generalized variable system was introduced to describe the different geometry configurations of the digital microfluidics. Specifically, Buckingham’s theorem had been adopted to obtain multiple groups of dimensionless numbers as the input variables of machine learning algorithms. Through the verification of the algorithms, the SVM and BPNN algorithms had classified and predicted the different flow patterns and droplet characteristics (the length and frequency) successfully. By comparing with the primitive parameters system, the dimensionless numbers system was superior in the predictive capability. The traditional dimensionless numbers selected for the machine learning algorithms should have physical meanings strongly rather than mathematical meanings. The machine learning algorithms applying the dimensionless numbers had declined the dimensionality of the system and the amount of computation and not lose the information of primitive parameters.},

  abstract = {A magnetic digital microfluidic platform manipulates droplets on an open surface.           ,              A digital microfluidic platform manipulates droplets on an open surface. Magnetic digital microfluidics utilizes magnetic forces for actuation and offers unique advantages compared to other digital microfluidic platforms. First, the magnetic particles used in magnetic digital microfluidics have multiple functions. In addition to serving as actuators, they also provide a functional solid substrate for molecule binding, which enables a wide range of applications in molecular diagnostics and immunodiagnostics. Second, magnetic digital microfluidics can be manually operated in a “power-free” manner, which allows for operation in low-resource environments for point-of-care diagnostics where even batteries are considered a luxury item. This review covers research areas related to magnetic digital microfluidics. This paper first summarizes the current development of magnetic digital microfluidics. Various methods of droplet manipulation using magnetic forces are discussed, ranging from conventional magnetic particle-based actuation to the recent development of ferrofluids and magnetic liquid marbles. This paper also discusses several new approaches that use magnetically controlled flexible substrates for droplet manipulation. In addition, we emphasize applications of magnetic digital microfluidics in biosensing and medical diagnostics, and identify the current limitations of magnetic digital microfluidics. We provide a perspective on possible solutions to close these gaps. Finally, the paper discusses the future improvement of magnetic digital microfluidics to explore potential new research directions.},

  abstract = {As more micro- and nanofluidic methodologies are developed for a growing number of diverse applications, it becomes increasingly apparent that the choice of substrate material can have a profound effect on the eventual performance of a device. This is due mostly to the high surface-to-volume ratio that exists within such small structures. In addition to the obvious limitations related to the choice of solvent, operating temperatures, and pressure, the method of fluidic pumping—in particular, an electrokinetics-based methodology using a combination of electro-osmotic and electrophoresis flows—can further complicate material choice. These factors, however, are only part of the problem; once chemicals or biological materials (e.g., proteins or cells) are introduced into a microfluidic system, surface characteristics will have a profound influence on the activity of such components, which will subsequently influence their performance. This article reviews the common types of materials that are currently used to fabricate microfluidic devices and considers how these materials may influence the overall performance associated with chemical and biological processing.},

The GenMark Dx ePlex investigational use only blood culture identification fungal pathogen panel (BCID-FP) rapidly detects 15 fungal targets simultaneously in blood culture samples positive for fungi by Gram staining. We aimed to determine the performance of the BCID-FP in a multicenter clinical study. Blood culture samples collected at 10 United States sites and tested with BCID-FP at 4 sites were compared to the standard-of-care microbiological and biochemical techniques, fluorescence in situ hybridization using peptide nucleic acid probes (PNAFISH) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Discrepant results were analyzed by bi-directional PCR/ sequencing of residual blood culture samples. A total of 866 clinical samples, 120 retrospectively and 21 prospectively collected, along with 725 contrived samples were evaluated. Sensitivity and specificity of detection of Candida species (C. albicans, C. auris, C. dubliniensis, C. famata, C. glabrata, C. guilliermondii, C. kefyr, C. krusei, C. lusitaniae, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis) ranged from 97.1 to 100\% and 99.8 to 100\%, respectively. For the other organism targets, sensitivity and specificity were as follows: 100\% each for Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii, 98.6\% and 100\% for Fusarium spp., and 96.2\% and 99.9\% for Rhodotorula spp., respectively. In 4 of the 141 clinical samples, the BCID-FP panel correctly identified an additional Candida species, undetected by standard-of-care methods. The BCID-FP panel offers a faster turnaround time for identification of fungal pathogens in positive blood cultures that may allow for earlier antifungal interventions and includes C. auris, a highly multidrug-resistant fungus.},

  abstract = {Abstract             State-of-the-art microfluidic systems rely on relatively expensive and bulky off-chip infrastructures. The core of a system—the microfluidic chip—requires a clean room and dedicated skills to be fabricated. Thus, state-of-the-art microfluidic systems are barely accessible, especially for the do-it-yourself (DIY) community or enthusiasts. Recent emerging technology—3D-printing—has shown promise to fabricate microfluidic chips more simply, but the resulting chip is mainly hardened and single-layered and can hardly replace the state-of-the-art Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chip. There exists no convenient fluidic control mechanism yet suitable for the hardened single-layered chip, and particularly, the hardened single-layered chip cannot replicate the pneumatic valve—an essential actuator for automatically controlled microfluidics. Instead, 3D-printable non-pneumatic or manually actuated valve designs are reported, but their application is limited. Here, we present a low-cost accessible all-in-one portable microfluidic system, which uses an easy-to-print single-layered 3D-printed microfluidic chip along with a novel active control mechanism for fluids to enable more applications. This active control mechanism is based on air or gas interception and can, e.g., block, direct, and transport fluid. As a demonstration, we show the system can automatically control the fluid in microfluidic chips, which we designed and printed with a consumer-grade 3D-printer. The system is comparably compact and can automatically perform user-programmed experiments. All operations can be done directly on the system with no additional host device required. This work could support the spread of low budget accessible microfluidic systems as portable, usable on-the-go devices and increase the application field of 3D-printed microfluidic devices.},

In this work, we present a novel combinatorial screening platform based on the surface energy trap (SET)-assisted magnetic digital microfluidics. This platform, known as FlipDrop, rapidly generates chemical combinations by coupling two droplet arrays with orthogonal chemical concentration gradients with a simple flip. We have illustrated the working principle of FlipDrop by generating combinations of quantum dots. We have also successfully demonstrated the screening of quantum dot fluorescence resonance energy transfer (QD-FRET) on the FlipDrop platform by measuring the FRET response. This report demonstrates that FlipDrop is capable of rapidly generating chemical combinations with unprecedented ease for combinatorial screening.},

  abstract = {The gas sensor based on pristine graphene with conductance type was studied theoretically and experimentally. The time response of conductance measurements showed a quickly and largely increased conductivity when the sensor was exposed to ammonia gas produced by a bubble system of ammonia water. However, the desorption process in vacuum took more than 1 h which indicated that there was a larger number of transferred carriers and a strong adsorption force between ammonia and graphene. The desorption time could be greatly shortened down to about 2 min by adding the flow of water-vapor-enriched air at the beginning of the recovery stage which had been confirmed as a rapid and high-efficiency desorption process. Moreover, the optimum geometries, adsorption energies, and the charge transfer number of the composite systems were studied with first-principle calculations. However, the theoretical results showed that the adsorption energy between NH3 and graphene was too small to fit for the experimental phenomenon, and there were few charges transferred between graphene and NH3 molecules, which was completely different from the experiment measurement. The adsorption energy between NH4 and graphene increased stage by stage which showed NH4 was a strong donor. The calculation suggested that H2O molecule could help a quick desorption of NH4 from graphene by converting NH4 to NH3 or (NH3)n(H2O)m groups, which was consistent with the experimental results. This study demonstrates that the ammonia gas produced by a bubble system of ammonia water is mainly ammonium groups of NH3 and NH4, and the NH4 moleculars are ideal candidates for the molecular doping of graphene while the interaction between graphene and the NH3 moleculars is weak.},

Basic operations such as droplet dispensing, mixing, dilution, localized heating, and incubation can be carried out using a 2-D array of electrodes and nanoliter volumes of liquid. The number of independent input pins used to control the electrodes in such microfluidic “biochips” is an important cost-driver, especially for disposable printed circuit board devices that are being developed for clinical and point-of-care diagnostics. However, most prior work on biochip design-automation has assumed independent control of the electrodes using a large number of input pins. We present a broadcast-addressing-based design technique for pin-constrained multifunctional biochips. The proposed method provides high throughput for bioassays and it reduces the number of control pins by identifying and connecting control pins with “compatible” actuation sequences. We also describe two scheduling methods to map fluidic operations on the pin-constrained design, in order to minimize the completion time while avoiding pinactuation conflicts. The proposed methods are evaluated using multifunctional chips designed to execute a set of multiplexed bioassays, the polymerase chain reaction, and a protein dilution assay.},

However, most prior work on pin-constrained biochip design considers droplet routing and the assignment of pins to electrodes as independent problems. We propose an integer linear programming (ILP)based optimization method to solve the droplet-routing and the pin-mapping design problems concurrently. The proposed co-optimization method optimizes routing pathways, generates a single pin-assignment, and attempts to minimize the number of control pins. It also overcomes a major limitation of recent work on this problem—the method described in prior work can lead to infeasible designs due to the need to change the mapping of pins to electrodes dynamically during bioassay execution. The effectiveness of the proposed co-optimization method is demonstrated for a commercial biochip that is used to perform n-plex immunoassays, as well as an experimental chip for multiplexed in-vitro diagnostics.},

Owing to its great advantages such as easy operation, sensitive response and electrical reversibility, EW has found many applications in various fields, especially in micro- and nano-fluidics, electronic display, etc. The aim of this review is to inspire new investigations on EW, not only in theory and numerical simulation, but also in experiments, and spur further research on EW for more practical applications. A comprehensive review is presented on the EW research progress, and experiments, theoretical modeling and numerical simulations are covered. After a brief look at the development history, some latest experimental and simulation methods, such as Lattice Boltzmann method, phase-field method and molecular dynamics (MD), are introduced. Some representative practical applications are then presented. Unresolved issues and prospects on EW as the final part of this review are expected to attract more attention and inspire more in-depth studies in this fascinating area.},

Synthesis tools have also emerged for the automated design of lab-on-chip from the specifications of laboratory protocols. However, none of these tools consider control flow or address the problem of recovering from fluidic errors that can occur during on-chip bioassay execution. We present a synthesis method that incorporates control paths and an error-recovery mechanism in the design of a digital microfluidic lab-on-chip. Based on error-propagation estimates, we determine the best locations for fluidic checkpoints during biochip synthesis. A microcontroller coordinates the implementation of the control-flow-based bioassay by intercepting the synthesis results that are mapped to the software programs. Real-life bioassay applications are used as case studies to evaluate the proposed design method. For a representative protein assay, compared to a baseline chip design, the biochip with a control path can reduce the completion time by 30\% when errors occur during the implementation of the bioassay.},

It has resulted in label‐free and low‐cost manipulation techniques in microfluidic systems and many exciting applications. It is the goal of this review to introduce the fundamental principles of negative magnetophoresis and its recent applications in microfluidic manipulation of particles and cells. The theoretical background of three commonly used specificities of manipulation in magnetic liquids is first discussed, including the size, density and magnetic property of particles and cells. This is followed by a review and comparison of the media used in negative magnetophoresis, which include paramagnetic salt solutions and ferrofluids. Afterwards, the existing microfluidic applications of negative magnetophoresis are reviewed, including separation, focusing, trapping and concentration of particles and cells, determination of cell density, measurement of particles' magnetic susceptibility, and others. The need for developing biocompatible magnetic liquids for live cell manipulation and analysis and its recent progress are also examined.

To reduce product cost for disposable biochips, testing steps and functional fluidic operations must be implemented on pin-constrained designs. However, previous testing methods for pin-constrained designs do not optimize test schedules to reduce the number of control pins and test/assay completion time. We propose a pin-count-aware online testing method for pin-constrained designs to support the execution of both fault testing and the target bioassay protocol. The proposed method interleaves fault testing with the target bioassay protocol for online testing. It is aimed at significantly reducing the completion time for testing and for the bioassay, while keeping the number of control pins small. Two practical applications, namely a multiplexed bioassay and an interpolation-based mixing protocol, are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, traditional biosensing devices are expensive, bulky, and require a lot of time to detect, which also limited its application in resource‐limited areas. In recent years, Lab‐on‐PCB, which combines biosensing technology and PCB technology, has been widely used in biomedical applications due to its high integration, personalized design, and easy mass production. Among these Lab‐on‐PCB sensing devices, the PCB circuit plays an important role. It can be directly used as a resistance sensor to count cells, and also used as a control device to automatically control the detection device. Flexible PCBs can be used to make wearable medical biosensors. In addition, due to the high degree of integration of the PCB circuit, Lab‐on‐PCB can perform multiple inspections on the same platform, which reduces the inspection time equivalently. Therefore, in this review paper, we discuss the application of Lab‐on‐PCB in four analysis methods of cell analysis, biochemical analysis, immunoassay, and molecular diagnosis, and give some suggestions for improvement and future development trends at the end.},

However, most prior work on pinconstrained biochip design considers droplet routing and the assignment of pins to electrodes as independent problems. In this paper, we propose optimization methods to solve the droplet routing and pin-constrained design problems concurrently. First, we formulate the co-optimization problem involving droplet routing and pin-mapping. Next, we present an integer linear programming-based optimization method to solve the dropletrouting and the pin-mapping design problems concurrently. The proposed co-optimization method minimizes the number of control pins. We also present an efficient heuristic approach to tackle the co-optimization problem. These methods overcome a major drawback of a recently proposed method, which leads to infeasible solutions involving conflicts in the mapping of pins to electrodes in different droplet-routing stages. The effectiveness of the proposed co-optimization method is demonstrated for two commercial biochips and an experimental university chip for multiplexed in-vitro diagnostics.},

We also synchronize wash-droplet routing with sample/reagent droplet-routing steps by controlling the arrival order of droplets at cross-contamination sites. The proposed method minimizes droplet-routing time without cross-contamination, and it is especially effective for tight chip-area constraints. A real-life application is used for evaluation.},

In this paper, to resolve the lack of efficient methods for the 3-D actuation of nano-droplet with high tunability, we proposed the electro-wetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) driving scheme on a graphene surface. The droplet could be actuated when the EWOD saturated contact angle was reached, which determined the critical magnitude of E-field. The droplet velocity agreed well with the vcom \textasciitilde{} Ec-o1/2 law due to the film-detachment mechanism, which indicated the little viscous dissipation and good tunability for the proposed technique. The droplet velocity could also be tuned by changing the initial wettability of graphene surface. Detailed examination of the liquid-solid interface revealed the significant penetration of water molecules into the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) before the induction of droplet detachment, when the electric energy was converted into surface energy. For all cases studied, the saturated contact angle served as a sufficient condition for the actuation of droplet.},

MIP-based electrochemical sensors exhibit low limits of detection (LOD), high selectivity, high sensitivity and low cost. We put the emphasis on the design of imprinted polymers and their composites and coatings by radical polymerization, oxidative polymerization of conjugated monomers or sol-gel chemistry. Whilst most imprinted polymers are used in conjunction with differential pulse or square wave voltammetry for sensing organics and metal ions, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) appears as the chief technique for detecting bacteria or their corresponding proteins. Interestingly, bacteria could also be probed via their quorum sensing signaling molecules or flagella proteins. If much has been developed in the past decade with glassy carbon or gold electrodes, it is clear that carbon paste electrodes of imprinted polymers are more and more investigated due to their versatility. Shortlisted case studies were critically reviewed and discussed; clearly, a plethora of tricky strategies of designing selective electrochemical sensors are offered to “Imprinters”. We anticipate that this review will be of interest to experts and newcomers in the field who are paying time and effort combining electrochemical sensors with MIP technology.},

Herein, by combining the dielectrowetting technique with high-speed photography, the impact of a water drop on a surface with adjustable wettability is studied. Four different impact phenomena of the drop are identified, and the corresponding phase diagram is provided. As the surface wettability changes, the drop spreading factor and the dynamic contact angle differ for the same Weber number, exhibiting diverse drop behavior. A bubble entrapped on the surface is the most commonly observed phenomenon, and its maximum spreading factor and spreading time are dominated by the Weber number. However, its oscillation period and damping rate are independent of the Weber number. Moreover, a jet occurs on the surface with high hydrophobicity, and the inverse relationship between the jet velocity and radius is in good agreement with the theoretical model. Our work on drop impact based on the dielectrowetting effect can provide a new direction for the study of drop dynamics. Furthermore, the preparation method of the substrate with adjustable surface wettability could be applied in industrial fields such as inkjet printing and coating preparation.},

  abstract = {A digital microfluidic biochip (DMB) is an attractive platform for automating laboratory procedures in microbiology. To overcome the problem of cross-contamination due to fouling of the electrode surface in traditional DMBs, a contactless liquidhandling biochip technology, referred to as acoustofluidics, has recently been proposed. A major challenge in operating this platform is the need for a control signal of frequency 24 MHz and voltage range ±10/ ± 20 V to activate the inter-digitaltransducer (IDT) units in the biochip. A preliminary solution based on amplifiers, mechanical relays, and jump wires introduces signal loss (at least 6dB), signal coupling, and waveform distortion. In this paper, we present a new IDT-driver design that offers three major advantages: smaller form factor and lower cost, effective and high-quality signal generation and transmission, and fully-automated and flexible biochip control. Experimental demonstrations of droplet routing and a simple bioassay highlight the effectiveness of our hardware design.},

  abstract = {A digital microfluidic biochip (DMB) is an attractive platform for automating laboratory procedures in microbiology. To overcome the problem of cross-contamination due to fouling of the electrode surface in traditional DMBs, a contactless liquidhandling biochip technology, referred to as acoustofluidics, has recently been proposed. A major challenge in operating this platform is the need for a control signal of frequency 24 MHz and voltage range ±10/±20 V to activate the IDT units in the biochip. In this paper, we present a hardware design that can efficiently activate/de-activated each IDT, and can fully automate an bioprotocol. We also present a fault-tolerant synthesis technique that allows us to automatically map biomolecular protocols to acoustofluidic biochips. We develop and experimentally validate a velocity model, and use it to guide co-optimization for operation scheduling, module placement, and droplet routing in the presence of IDT faults. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed synthesis method. Our results are expected to open new research directions on design automation of digital acoustofluidic biochips.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) are being increasingly used for DNA sequencing, point-of-care clinical diagnostics and immunoassays. DMFBs based on a micro-electrodedot-array (MEDA) architecture have recently been proposed, and fundamental droplet manipulations, e.g., droplet mixing and splitting, have also been experimentally demonstrated on MEDA biochips. There can be thousands of microelectrodes on a single MEDA biochip, and the fine-grained control of nanoliter volumes of biochemical samples and reagents is also enabled by this technology. MEDA biochips offer the benefits of realtime sensitivity, lower cost, easy system integration with CMOS modules, and full automation. This review paper first describes recent design tools for high-level synthesis and optimization of to map bioassay protocols on a MEDA biochip. It then presents recent advances in scheduling of fluidic operations, placement of fluidic modules, droplet-size aware routing, adaptive error recovery, sample preparation, and various testing techniques. With the help of these tools, biochip users can concentrate on the development of nanoscale bioassays, leaving details of chip optimization and implementation to software tools.},

This work reviews the advances of MNPs-assisted microfluidic bioanalysis in the recent decade. The preparation and modification methods of MNPs are summarized as having a bioanalysis capability in microchips. These MNPs can be used for sample pretreatment materials and/or biosensing tags. In sample pretreatment, MNPs enable effective magnetic separation, preconcentration, and mass transport. In detection, MNPs act as not only magnetic sensing tags but also as the support for optical sensors. Finally, the overviews and challenges in microfluidic bioanalysis with the assistance of MNPs are discussed.},

  abstract = {Dielectrophoresis (DEP) utilizes the polarizability of dielectric colloidal scale objects to drive their motions under a non-uniform AC electric field. It enables a non-invasive, reversible approach to manipulating colloidal particles. DEP requires particles to have the size within the range between hundreds of nanometers to tens of micrometers and a dielectric constant opposite to the liquid medium, which then could allow relatively sophisticated manipulation of a wide variety of colloidal sc ale objects, such as cells, microorganisms, polymeric colloids, and many more. Such unique ability has made DEP a great tool for applica-tions in fields such as biomedical research and materials science. For example, DEP can be applied to sort cells based on their different dielectric constants and morphologies. It could also be applied for cell viability monitoring and stem cell fate prediction. Provoking colloidal crystallization is another good example of the DEP application. Unlike small molecules, the unique “colloidal scale” renders these particles visible by optical microscopy. As a result, the combination of DEP and optical microscopy has become a powerful tool for materials scientists to investigate the phenomenon of colloidal crystal nucleation and growth directly. In this review, recent works regarding DEP’s application on 2D colloidal crystallization will be discussed in detail. This review is intended to provide DEP’s critical functions on two different research fields and demonstrate interdisciplinary potential of DEP.},

By performing massive synthesis and characterization processes in parallel, it can rapidly discover materials with desired components, structures and functions. Among the various approaches for high-throughput screening, microfluidic platforms have attracted increasing attention. Compared with many current strategies that are generally based on robotic dispensers and automatic microplates, microfluidic platforms can significantly increase the throughput and reduce the consumption of reagents by several orders of magnitude. In this review, we first introduce current advances of the two types of microfluidic high-throughput platforms based on microarrays and microdroplets, respectively.

  abstract = {A significant growth of research on digital microfluidics has been achieved over the past several decades, and the field is still attracting increasing attention for fulfilling relevant mechanisms and potential applications. Numerous studies have been devoted to actively manipulating droplets in a variety of fundamental and applicational scenarios. In this work, the deformation of ferromagnetic fluid droplets is studied under an external uniform magnetic field. The droplets are precisely dispersed on the bottom surface of a container assembled with polymer methacrylate (PMMA) plates. Mineral oil is applied instead of air as the surrounding medium for easy stretching and preventing water solvent evaporation in ferrofluid. The design and processing of the container are firstly carried out to observe the shape and characterize the wettability of the droplets in the immiscible mineral oil medium. Furthermore, the droplets’ deformation and the working mechanism are given under the action of the horizontal uniform magnetic field. At different magnetic field intensities, the droplet is stretched in the horizontal direction parallel to the applied field. Due to volume conservation, the dimension in the height reduces correspondingly. With the coupling effect of magnetic force, viscous force and interfacial tension, the contact angle first increases with the magnetic field and then basically remains unchanged upon magnetization saturation. Consistent with the experimental results, the numerical method clearly reveals the field coupling mechanism and the nonlinear deformation of the sessile droplet.},

Digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) are one kind of miniaturized systems designed for conducting inexpensive, fast, convenient and reliable biochemical assay procedures focusing on basic scientific research and medical diagnostics. The role of a dielectric layer in the digital microfluidic biochips is prominent as it helps in actuating microliter droplets based on the electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) technique. The advantages of using three different material layers of dielectric such as parafilm, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) were reported in the current work. A simple fabrication process of a digital microfluidic device was performed and good results were obtained. The threshold of the actuation voltage was determined for all dielectric materials of varying thicknesses. Additionally, the OpenDrop device was tested by utilizing a single-plate system to transport microliter droplets for a bioassay operation. With the newly proposed fabrication methods, these dielectric materials showed changes in contact angle and droplet velocity when the actuation voltage was applied. The threshold actuation voltage for the dielectric layers of 10–13 µm was 190 V for the open plate DMFBs.},

  abstract = {Water monitoring technologies are widely used for contaminants detection in wide variety of water ecology applications such as water treatment plant and water distribution system. A tremendous amount of research has been conducted over the past decades to develop robust and efficient techniques of contaminants detection with minimum operating cost and energy. Recent developments in spectroscopic techniques and biosensor approach have improved the detection sensitivities, quantitatively and qualitatively. The availability of in-situ measurements and multiple detection analyses has expanded the water monitoring applications in various advanced techniques including successful establishment in hand-held sensing devices which improves portability in real-time basis for the detection of contaminant, such as microorganisms, pesticides, heavy metal ions, inorganic and organic components. This paper intends to review the developments in water quality monitoring technologies for the detection of biological and chemical contaminants in accordance with instrumental limitations. Particularly, this review focuses on the most recently developed techniques for water contaminant detection applications. Several recommendations and prospective views on the developments in water quality assessments will also be included.},
