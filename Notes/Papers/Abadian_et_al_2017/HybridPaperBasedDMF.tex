\chapter[Hybrid paper‑based microfluidics]{Hybrid paper‑based microfluidics: combination of paper‑based analytical device (\textmugreek PAD) and digital microfluidics (DMF) on a single substrate}

\section{Summary}
This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of microfluidics by introducing and experimentally validating a novel hybrid paper-based microfluidic (HPMF) device. This innovative platform strategically integrates the functionalities of paper-based analytical devices (\textmugreek PADs) and digital microfluidics (DMF) onto a single substrate, aiming to overcome the inherent limitations associated with each individual technology.\\

The authors posit that this synergistic combination enhances the capabilities of microfluidics in point-of-care (POCT) diagnostics by enabling controlled droplet manipulation for preprocessing on the DMF component, followed by versatile sensing and post-processing on the µPAD component.

\subsection{Focus}
The paper introduces a novel hybrid paper-based microfluidic (HPMF) device that integrates a digital microfluidic (DMF) platform with a microfluidic paper-based analytical device (µPAD) on a single paper substrate. This combination aims to leverage the strengths of both technologies while mitigating their respective limitations. \newpage
