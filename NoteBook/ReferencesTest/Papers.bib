But fluid flow controlling on microfluidics paperbased analytical devices ({\textmu}PADs) and post-processing on DMF devices have limitations. In this work a new hybrid paper-based device is proposed with the aim of resolving these limitations and expanding the microfluidics capabilities in point of care diagnostics. The hybrid paper-based microfluidics (HPMF) device is composed of a DMF device following a {\textmu}PAD in a single substrate, in which the DMF part performs the preprocessing steps of the test on droplets and transfers the resulting droplet to the {\textmu}PAD part of the device for post-processing steps. The fabrication process of the device is rapid and very low cost due to use of paper substrate and out of clean-room processes. The results show that the proposed HPMF device can perform droplet operations: moving, mixing, and splitting.},

In digital microfluidics (DMF), discrete droplets are manipulated by applying electrical fields to an array of electrodes.

Here, we review the state-of-the-art in DMF, with a discussion of device formats, actuation physics, and biological and nonbiological applications. Along the way, we identify the key players in the field, and speculate on the advances and challenges that lie ahead.

This technology proposes considerable improvements in terms of experiment speed, configurability and consumed experiment materials. In this paper a novel pin-constrained digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) architecture is introduced for general-purpose assay execution. The proposed DMFB enjoys cost-saving of pin-constrained designs while providing general-purpose assay execution comparable with direct-addressing DMFBs and retains the same level of functionality as previous pin-constrained designs with lower number of electrodes and in turn lower number of control pins. The experimental results show that while reducing number of electrodes and control pins we managed to achieve the same level of performance; regarding number of electrodes 20 \% and 56 \% improvements were obtained compared with pin-constrained and direct-addressing designs respectively. Considering number of control pins the proposed design enjoys 3 \% and 572 \% improvements compared with pin-constrained and directaddressing designs, respectively. Furthermore, since the availability of various routing paths, the proposed design offers droplet-routing times comparatively lower than previous pinconstrained designs; the routing times were reduced by 17 \% and 23 \% compared with pin-constrained and direct-addressing designs, respectively.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Increasing demand for self-powered wearable sensors has spurred an urgent need to develop energy harvesting systems that can reliably and sufficiently power these devices. Within the last decade, reverse electrowetting-on-dielectric (REWOD)-based mechanical motion energy harvesting has been developed, where an electrolyte is modulated (repeatedly squeezed) between two dissimilar electrodes under an externally applied mechanical force to generate an AC current. In this work, we explored various combinations of electrolyte concentrations, dielectrics, and dielectric thicknesses to generate maximum output power employing REWOD energy harvester. With the objective of implementing a fully self-powered wearable sensor, a ``zero applied-bias-voltage'' approach was adopted. Three different concentrations of sodium chloride aqueous solutions (NaCl-0.1~M, NaCl-0.5~M, and NaCl-1.0~M) were used as electrolytes. Likewise, electrodes were fabricated with three different dielectric thicknesses (100~nm, 150~nm, and 200~nm) of Al               2               O               3               and SiO               2               with an additional layer of CYTOP for surface hydrophobicity. The REWOD energy harvester and its electrode--electrolyte layers were modeled using lumped components that include a resistor, a capacitor, and a current source representing the harvester. Without using any external bias voltage, AC current generation with a power density of 53.3~nW/cm               2               was demonstrated at an external excitation frequency of 3~Hz with an optimal external load. The experimental results were analytically verified using the derived theoretical model. Superior performance of the harvester in terms of the figure-of-merit comparing previously reported works is demonstrated. The novelty of this work lies in the combination of an analytical modeling method and experimental validation that together can be used to increase the REWOD harvested power extensively without requiring any external bias voltage.},

Integration is accomplished by having the DMF and the RF-sensing components share the same ground plane: by designing the RF-resonant openings directly into the ground plane of a DMF device, both droplet motion and sensing are achieved, adding a new on-board detection mode for use in DMF. The system was modelled to determine basic features and to balance various factors that need to be optimized to maintain both functionalities (DMF-enabled droplet movement and RF detection) on the same chip. Simulated and experimental results show good agreement. Using a portable measurement setup, the integrated CSSR sensor was used to effectively identify a series of DMF-generated drops of ethanol--water mixtures of different compositions by measuring the resonant frequency of the CSSR. In addition, we show that a binary solvent system (ethanol/water mixtures) results in consistent changes in the measured spectrum in response to changes in concentration, indicating that the sensor can distinguish not only between pure solvents from each other, but also between mixtures of varied compositions. We anticipate that this system can be refined further to enable additional applications and detection modes for DMF systems and other portable sensing platforms alike. This proof-of-principle study demonstrates that the integrated DMF--CSSR sensor provides a new platform for monitoring and characterization of liquids with high sensitivity and low consumption of materials, and opens the way for new and exciting applications of RF sensing in microfluidics.},

In the present work, an interdigitated electrode (IDE) config\- uration is introduced for producing oscillating droplets for heat dissipation in electronic devices. It resolves the problem of interfering wire used as an electrode in conventional methods of producing droplet oscillation. The dynamics of droplet oscillation and heat transfer effectiveness have been investigated for different voltages, frequencies, and droplet volumes. The time history of the instantaneous contact angle, contact radius, and height of the droplet have been analyzed for sinusoidal AC voltages. Moreover, oscillation dynamics with IDE config\- uration have been compared with that produced by the conventional method. The oscillation frequency of the droplet is higher in the IDE configuration than the droplet oscillation with wire. The frequency of the droplet oscillation is observed more than twice the applied frequency. The change in apparent contact angle increases with the applied voltage. In the presence of wire, the droplet exhibits translational behavior rather than oscil\- lation below 20 Hz. The first resonant frequency of the droplet oscillation is reduced from 30 Hz in wire configuration to 10 Hz in the IDE configuration. The heat transfer performance of the oscillating droplet has been calculated from the time required for complete droplet evaporation with and without oscillation. Heat transfer performance is maximum at the first resonant frequency and decreases with an increase in applied frequency. The droplet evaporation rate decreases with the volume of the droplet, whereas it increases with the applied heat flux. The present work establishes that electrowetting actuated droplet oscillation over IDE can be implemented as an effective and scalable technique for cooling of hotspots in electronic devices.},

  abstract = {A new microfluidic platform that integrates droplet and digital microfluidics to automate a variety of fluidic operations. The platform was applied to culturing and to selecting yeast mutant cells in ionic liquid.           ,                             Droplet microfluidics is a technique that has the ability to compartmentalize reactions in sub nano- (or pico-) liter volumes that can potentially enable millions of distinct biological assays to be performed on individual cells. In a typical droplet microfluidic system, droplets are manipulated by pressure-based flows. This has limited the fluidic operations that can be performed in these devices. Digital microfluidics is an alternative microfluidic paradigm with precise control and manipulation over individual droplets. Here, we implement an integrated droplet-digital microfluidic (which we call `ID2M') system in which common fluidic operations (               i.e.               droplet generation, cell encapsulation, droplet merging and mixing, droplet trapping and incubation, and droplet sorting) can be performed. With the addition of electrodes, we have been able to create droplets on-demand, tune their volumes on-demand, and merge and mix several droplets to produce a dilution series. Moreover, this device can trap and incubate droplets for 24 h that can consequently be sorted and analyzed in multiple n-ary channels (as opposed to typical binary channels). The ID2M platform has been validated as a robust on-demand screening system by sorting fluorescein droplets of different concentration with an efficiency of {$\sim$}96\%. The utility of the new system is further demonstrated by culturing and sorting tolerant yeast mutants and wild-type yeast cells in ionic liquid based on their growth profiles. This new platform for both droplet and digital microfluidics has the potential to be used for screening different conditions on-chip and for applications like directed evolution.},

  abstract = {In this paper, microdroplet evaporation in the closed digital microfluidic systems is studied for hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. The contact angle and contact radius are measured by an enhanced automated polynomial fitting approach. It is observed that the contact angle for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces remains constant during the evaporation process. However, a higher evaporation rate is observed for hydrophilic droplets compared to the hydrophobic droplets. Since no contact line pinning is observed, first, an analytical model based on the uniform vapor mass flux along the liquid--vapor interface is proposed. Interestingly, it is observed that in the hydrophobic case, the analytical model gives a higher evaporation rate, whereas for the hydrophilic case, the analytical model gives a lower evaporation rate. The discrepancy between the results of the analytical modeling and the experimental values is hypothesized to be due the constant flux assumption. To verify the hypothesis, a finite volume-based numerical model is developed to find the local flux along the liquid--vapor interface. The numerical modeling results confirm that for hydrophilic droplets, the evaporation flux increases very close to the three-phase contact line. In the case of the hydrophobic droplets, on the other hand, the flux decreases close to the contact line due to vapor saturation; as a result the uniform flux assumption overestimates the mass loss.},

Therefore, the characterization and optimization of the interaction of chemical and biological solutions through microfluidic channels are vital for fluid flow design and engineering for quality assurance in microfluidic platforms. As the internal structures and kinetics of microfluidic channels are becoming increasingly complex, experiments involving optimal fluidic and transport designs are challenging to perform with high accuracy. However, highly integrated simulation tools can guide researchers without specialized computational fluid backgrounds to design numerical prototypes of highly integrated devices. In this study, a microfluidic chip with two inlet wells and one outlet well was fabricated from polydimethylsiloxane following which simulations were performed using an ANSYS Fluent tool influenced by computational fluid dynamics at a nearly identical scale. The pressure drop and velocity profiles of the interaction of two pH buffer solutions (pH 4 and 10) through the designed microfluidic chip were qualitatively estimated from experimental data analysis and validated with the simulation results obtained from the CFD-influenced ANSYS Fluent tool.},

In contrast to real-time PCR (qPCR), dPCR can perform quantification without requiring previous standard curve experiments. Furthermore, dPCR is more sensitive for rare targets in genetic samples. Despite the significant advantages of dPCR over qPCR, dPCR is not widely applied yet due to the complicated requirements of instrumentations regarding creating sample subvolumes and the equipment cost associated with this. In this paper, we present a microwell array that can be used for dPCR. The microwell array can be operated with little microfluidic expertise, while it can be manufactured at a unit cost of less than 1\$. The amplification results of the microwell array can be analyzed with a custom-written Python script. With this method, we have been able to amplify and quantify complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) samples for the H7N9 influenza virus in a concentration range spanning three orders of magnitude (1,000-100,000 copies/{\textmu}L).},

  abstract = {Single-plate digital microfluidic devices offer a set of advantages over two-plate devices such as better mixing, the ability to move larger volumes, and easier access to the droplet. Currently, the non-floating configuration, where all non-energized electrodes on the device are grounded, is the most common electrode switching scheme used in single-plate devices. However, this scheme is limited by the symmetry of the electric field around the energized electrode, which can prevent complete droplet transport to the energized electrode for small droplets that can be seamlessly manipulated on two-plate devices. Here we present a numerical model to analyze the effect of droplet volume on the electrical forces generated on droplets actuated on single-plate digital micro\- fluidic devices. We show that the commonly used non-floating switching scheme has a limit on the smallest droplet volume it can manipulate even if the droplet base diameter is larger than the electrode length; a condition that is currently believed sufficient for complete droplet movement. The model we built used Maxwell Stress tensor to calculate the electrical forces on the droplet to capture the effect of the grounding scheme more accurately than the contact angle change model. We used this model to analyze movability of droplets of various volumes and contact angles to find the minimum volume that can be successfully actuated. We also suggest better electrode designs that improve actuation of small droplets on single-plate devices and make their performance comparable to two-plate devices.},

Volumes of 10 {\textmu}L, 14 {\textmu}L, and 18 {\textmu}L were investigated with voltages ranging from 250 V to 400 V. The goal was to investigate how variations in voltage and droplet volume affected the contact angle, specifically by tracking variations in the advancing and receding contact angles. The findings showed that as voltage rises, the contact angle decreases more noticeably in terms of both advancing and receding angles. This shows that higher voltages boost the electrowetting effect and lead to better droplet dispersal and substrate wetting. Furthermore, it was found that across the studied voltage range, the effect of volume on the contact angle was largely consistent. The relation between voltage, volume, and contact angle in electrowetting is better understood from our analysis.},

The digital microfluidic biochips are based on the manipulation of liquids not as a continuous flow, but as discrete droplets on an array of electrodes. Microfluidic operations, such as transport, mixing, split, are performed on this array by routing the corresponding droplets on a series of electrodes. Several approaches have been proposed for the compilation of digital microfluidic biochips, which, starting from a biochemical application and a given biochip architecture, determine the allocation, resource binding, scheduling, placement and routing of the operations in the application. To simplify the compilation problem, researchers have assumed an abstract droplet size of one electrode. However, the droplet size abstraction is not realistic and it impacts negatively the execution of the biochemical application, leading in most cases to its failure. Hence the existing compilation approaches have to be revisited to consider the size of the droplets. In this paper we take the first step towards a droplet size-aware compilation by proposing a routing algorithm that considers the droplet size. Our routing algorithm is developed for a novel digital microfluidic biochip architecture based on Active Matrix Electrowetting on Dielectric, which uses a thin film transistor array for the electrodes. We also implement a simulator that allows us to perform the needed adaptations and to validate the proposed routing algorithm.},

The quantification of Escherichia coli was investigated with standard and nanomaterial amplified immunoassays in the concentration ranges of 0.99 {\texttimes} 104 e3.98 {\texttimes} 109 cfu mL-1 and 10e3.97 {\texttimes} 107 cfu mL-1 which resulted in detection limits of 1.99 {\texttimes} 104 cfu mL-1 and 50 cfu mL-1, respectively. The developed methodology was then applied for E. coli quantification in water samples using nanomaterial modified assay. Same detection limit for E. coli was achieved for real sample analysis with a little decrease on the sensor signal. Cross-reactivity studies were conducted by testing Shigella, Salmonella spp., Salmonella typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus on E. coli specific antibody surface that confirmed the high specificity of the developed immunoassays. The sensor surface could be regenerated multiple times which significantly reduces the cost of the system. Our custom-designed biosensor is capable of detecting bacteria with high sensitivity and specificity, and can serve as a promising tool for pathogen detection.},

However, fabrication of microfluidic devices is often complicated, time consuming, and requires expensive equipment and sophisticated cleanroom facilities. Three-dimensional (3D) printing presents a promising alternative to traditional techniques such as lithography and PDMS-glass bonding, not only by enabling rapid design iterations in the development stage, but also by reducing the costs associated with institutional infrastructure, equipment installation, maintenance, and physical space. With the recent advancements in 3D printing technologies, highly complex microfluidic devices can be fabricated via single-step, rapid, and cost-effective protocols, making microfluidics more accessible to users. In this review, we discuss a broad range of approaches for the application of 3D printing technology to fabrication of micro-scale lab-on-a-chip devices.},

The results were compared with experimental data and the results show good accuracy of the numerical simulation. Also, the stability of a droplet in a finite system was studied analytically and numerically (by LBM) and it was shown that the droplet stability is a function of system size and droplet contact angle. The simulation results were in good agreement with analytical solution and it has been concluded that in the finite systems an unstable droplet can be stabilized by applying a voltage (i.e., using EW). Based on this observation, a new method for droplets merging in finite systems has been proposed.},

Superb control of the volume, uniformity, and generation rate of droplets and bubbles arises from unique features of the microscale behavior of fluid interfaces. Fluid interfaces confined within microfluidic channels behave quite differently than their counterparts in unbounded flows. Confinement inhibits capillary instabilities so that breakup occurs by largely quasi-static mechanisms. The three-dimensional flow near confined interfaces in rectangular geometries and feedback effects from resistance changes in the entire microfluidic network play important roles in regulating the interfacial deformation. Timescales for transport of surfactants and particles to interfaces compete with flow timescales at the microscale, providing further opportunity for tuning the interfacial coverage and properties of individual droplets and bubbles.},

  abstract = {The static shape of droplets under electrowetting actuation is well-understood. The steady-state shape of the droplet is obtained based on the balance of surface tension and electrowetting forces, and the change in apparent contact angle is well-characterized by the Young-Lippmann equation. However, the transient droplet shape behavior when a voltage is suddenly applied across a droplet has received less attention. Additional dynamic frictional forces are at play during this transient process. We present a model to predict this transient behavior of the droplet shape under electrowetting actuation. The droplet shape is modeled using the volume of fluid method. The electrowetting and dynamic frictional forces are included as an effective dynamic contact angle through a force balance at the contact line. The model is used to predict the transient behavior of water droplets on smooth hydrophobic surfaces under electrowetting actuation. The predictions of transient behavior of droplet shape and contact radius are in excellent agreement our experimental measurements. The internal fluid motion is explained and the droplet motion is shown to initiate from the contact line. An approximate mathematical model is also developed to understand the physics of the droplet motion and to describe the overall droplet motion and the contact line velocities.},

Given these demands, microfluidic platforms have emerged over the past two decades as well-suited approaches for multiplexed assays. Microfluidic design supports integration of assay steps and reproducible sample manipulation across large sets of conditions---all relevant to multiplexed assays. Taken together, reduced reagent consumption, faster assay times, and potential for automation stemming from microfluidic assay design are attractive and needed multiplexed assay performance attributes.

The proposed device is fabricated by the low-cost screen printing method using very low-cost materials. In order to overcome the weak controllability of the device over the droplets, a new thermal confinement technique is proposed which simply embedded in the device electrode pattern. A new thermally actuated valve is also designed to work based on thermocapillary actuation for switching on or off the droplets. The fabricated DMF device and the thermal valve are both combined with a microfluidics paper-based analytical device to form a hybrid paper chip in which the droplets are driven by both channelbased and droplet-based devices.

  abstract = {Biofouling in microfluidic devices limits the type of samples which can be handled and the duration for which samples can be manipulated. Despite the cost of disposing fouled devices, relatively few strategies have been developed to tackle this problem. Here, we have analyzed a series of eight amphiphilic droplet additives, Pluronic coblock polymers of poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), as a solution to biofouling in digital microfluidics using serum-containing cell culture media as a model fluid. Our analysis shows that species with longer PPO chains are superior for enabling droplet motion and reducing biofouling. Two of the tested species, L92 and P105, were found to lengthen device lifetimes by 2{\`A}3 times relative to additives used previously when used at optimal concentrations. Pluronics with low PEO content such as L92 were found to be cytotoxic to an immortalized mammalian cell line, and therefore we recommend that Pluronic additives with greater or equal to 50\% PEO composition, such as P105, be used for digital microfluidic applications involving cells. Finally, contact angle measurements were used to probe the interaction between Pluronic-containing droplets and device surfaces. Strong correlations were found between various types of contact angle measurements and the capacity of additives to reduce biofouling, which suggests that contact angle measurements may be useful as a tool for rapidly screening new candidates for the potential to reduce biofouling. We propose that this study will be useful for scientists and engineers who are developing digital microfluidic platforms for a wide range of applications involving protein-containing solutions, and in particular, for applications involving cells.},

  abstract = {Large-scale food-borne outbreaks caused by Salmonella are rarely seen nowadays, thanks to the advanced nature of the medical system. However, small, localised outbreaks in certain regions still exist and could possess a huge threat to the public health if eradication measure is not initiated. This review discusses the progress of Salmonella detection approaches covering their basic principles, characteristics, applications, and performances. Conventional Salmonella detection is usually performed using a culture-based method, which is time-consuming, labour intensive, and unsuitable for on-site testing and high-throughput analysis. To date, there are many detection methods with a unique detection system available for Salmonella detection utilising immunological-based techniques, molecular-based techniques, mass spectrometry, spectroscopy, optical phenotyping, and biosensor methods. The electrochemical biosensor has growing interest in Salmonella detection mainly due to its excellent sensitivity, rapidity, and portability. The use of a highly specific bioreceptor, such as aptamers, and the application of nanomaterials are contributing factors to these excellent characteristics.

In this review paper, we focus on such flows on centrifugal microfluidic platforms and present different methods of dispersed phase material generation. These methods are classified into three specific categories, i.e., step emulsification, crossflow, and dispenser nozzle. Previous works on these topics are discussed and related parameters and specifications, including the size, material, production rate, and rotational speed are explicitly mentioned. In addition, the associated theories and important dimensionless numbers are presented. Finally, we discuss the commercialization of these devices and show a comparison to unveil the pros and cons of the different methods so that researchers can select the centrifugal droplet/particle generation method which better suits their needs.},

This method uses typical microscopic glass slides as a substrate for fabrication of microchannels. Using photo-resist as a mask instead of some deposition methods makes the procedure more convenient and cost effective compare to other techniques. A smooth channel surface with acceptable sharp wall edges makes this procedure suitable for so many applications that vertical walls are not crucial. The comparison between fabrication of channels using wet etching procedures and molding techniques can help to select the more suitable one for any application which needs specific characteristics.},

  abstract = {This paper presents theoretical and numerical results describing digitized heat transfer (DHT), a newly developing active thermal management technique for high-power density electronics and integrated micro systems. In describing DHT, we numerically investigate the mass, momentum, and energy equations governing the flow within a translating microdroplet. Our analysis shows the existence of a pair of recirculation zones inside the droplet. This internal circulation within discrete fluid slugs results in significantly increased overall heat transfer coefficients when compared to continuous Graetz-type flows. The internal circulation drives the cold fluid in the middle of the droplet to the vicinity of the walls and creates a higher local temperature difference between the wall and the fluid in contact with the wall, resulting in higher heat transfer rates. Nusselt numbers characterizing DHT flow are also shown to exhibit periodic fluctuations with a period equal to the characteristic time scale for droplet circulation. The overall effect of discretizing a flow on heat transfer capability is described and characterized in terms of a nondimensional circulation number defined by the ratio of characteristic thermal diffusion and fluid circulation time scales. DHT coolants, including liquid metals and alloys, are proposed, and their physical properties are shown to enable handling of significantly higher heat transfer rates than classical airor water-cooled methods. The actuation method for DHT coolant transport is also outlined, and shown to provide the capability for active, on-demand suppression of transient hot spots. This overall analysis defines the key parameters for optimization of the DHT method and forms the basis of ongoing experimental work.},

Digital microfluidics is gaining popularity in biological and biomedical applications due to its ability to manipulate discrete droplet volumes (nL--pL), which significantly reduces the need for a costly and precious biological and physiological sample volume and, thus, diagnostic time. Despite the importance of discrete droplet volume handling, the ability of continuous microfluidics to process larger sample volumes at a higher throughput cannot be easily reproduced by merely using droplets. To bridge this gap, in this work, parallel channels are formed and programmed to split into multiple droplets, while droplets are programmed to be split from one channel, transferred and merged into another channel. This programmable handling of channels and droplets combines the continuous and digital paradigms of microfluidics, showing the potential for a wider range of microfluidic functions to enable applications ranging from clinical diagnostics in resource-limited environments, to rapid system prototyping, to high throughput pharmaceutical applications.},

However, the conventional numerical simulation approach is quite time-consuming. Therefore, an efficient analytical method is proposed herein, leading to accurate capacitance and conductance expressions of an arbitrary multilayer-structured IDC. The model is validated with practical measurements of a series of coplanar waveguide (CPW) structure-based IDCs. In addition, an accurate characterization function, which relates the IDC capacitance and conductance to the complex permittivity of a material loaded on the top of the IDC sensing area, is obtained. The characterization function shows good agreement with the finite-element method (FEM) simulation results, which demonstrates the capability of the IDC sensor in dielectric spectroscopy measurements of {\textmu}L and even nL liquids.},

Two sensors are used in the paper to characterize saline solutions by measuring the broadband complex permittivity. The two sensors are based on transmission line and interdigital electrodes designed for low- and high- frequency measurements, respectively, on the basis of the coplanar waveguide structure due to its convenience of fabrication and integration with microfluidic structures for liquid measurements. Different from traditional work where the finite element simulation method is used, the characterization theories of the two sensors are built based on a numerical modeling procedure, which can dramatically increase the device design efficiency, taking just a few seconds. Differently from the finite element method, the proposed numerical analysis utilizes a conformal mapping technique for both sensors. The characterization theories of the two sensors are validated by measuring de-ionized water. The platform is finally used to measure 0.1 and 0.5 mol/L saline solutions within a broadband frequency range going from 10 up to 50 GHz, with the repeatability error within 5\%.},

The chamber's geometry, transport channels, and the electrodes were designed using an optimization process through multiphysics simulations. Then, different manufacturing processes were developed experimentally for SU8 and PDMS which allowed to carry out the implementation of the microfluidic system. An electrical communication interface was designed for the interconnection of the microfluidic system with the vector network analyzer (VNA).

Modern synthetic biology has been reinvented as an engineering discipline to design new organisms as well as to better understand fundamental biological mechanisms. However, success is still largely limited to the laboratory and transformative applications of synthetic biology are still in their infancy. Here, we review six principles of living systems and how they compare and contrast with engineered systems. We cite specific examples from the synthetic biology literature that illustrate these principles and speculate on their implications for further study. To fully realize the promise of synthetic biology, we must be aware of life's unique properties.},

The GO-PDMS composite is characterized by higher values of the dielectric constant, higher breakdown electric field, and lower actuation voltages due to enhanced interfacial polarization. The improvement of these properties with the increase in concentration of GO, is explored till the `percolation threshold'. This newly developed composite as the dielectric, droplet actuation and electric field-induced droplet transportation over a fabricated triangular electrode system are performed. The results are compared with the literature data on PDMS and other dielectrics to establish the superior qualities of the dielectric for rapid transportation of droplets at significantly lower voltages with potential for new applications.},

Firstly, side-view observations using stroboscopic recording techniques were used to measure and analyse droplet deformations as well as the front and rear apparent contact angles during motion. Secondly, the influence of viscosity on the droplet velocity as a function of the applied voltage was studied. This has revealed that low Reynolds number droplet motion can be described by the simple laminar viscous model of Brochard. Finally, the influence of the dielectric thickness on the droplet dynamics was studied. It is shown that droplet velocity is limited by a saturation effect of the driving electrostatic force and that this phenomenon is very similar to that occurring in static experiments.},

Rapid, reliable detection and identification of this pathogen in food and environmental sources is key to safeguarding the food supply. Traditional microbiological culture techniques have been the `gold standard' for State and Federal regulators. Unfortunately, the time to result is too long to effectively monitor foodstuffs, especially those with very short shelf lives. Advances in traditional microbiology and molecular biology over the past 25 years have greatly improved the speed at which this pathogen is detected. Nonetheless, food and environmental samples possess a distinctive set of challenges for these newer, more rapid methodologies. Furthermore, more detailed identification and subtyping strategies still rely heavily on the availability of a pure isolate. However, major shifts in DNA sequencing technologies are meeting this challenge by advancing the detection, identification and subtyping of Salmonella towards a culture-independent diagnostic framework. This review will focus on current approaches and state-of-the-art next-generation advances in the detection, identification and subtyping of Salmonella from food and environmental sources.},

The simple MEMS processing protocols typically employed to fabricate D{\textmu}F devices limit their functionality to two dimensions, and hence constrain the applications for which these devices can be used. This paper describes the integration of vertical functionality into a D{\textmu}F platform by stacking two planar digital microfluidic devices, altering the electrode fabrication process, and incorporating channels for reversibly translating droplets between layers. Vertical droplet movement was modeled to advance the device design, and three applications that were previously unachievable using a conventional format are demonstrated: (1) solutions of calcium dichloride and sodium alginate were vertically mixed to produce a hydrogel with a radially symmetric gradient in crosslink density; (2) a calcium alginate hydrogel was formed within the through-well to create a particle sieve for filtering suspensions passed from one layer to the next; and (3) a cell spheroid formed using an on-chip hanging-drop was retrieved for use in downstream processing. The general capability of vertically delivering droplets between multiple stacked levels represents a processing innovation that increases D{\textmu}F functionality and has many potential applications.},

Dilution and mixing of fluid samples in a certain ratio are two fundamental primitives needed in sample preparation, which is an essential component of almost all protocols. Most of the existing dilution algorithms used in droplet-based microfluidic systems deploy a sequence of (1 : 1) mix-split steps, where two unit volume droplets of different concentrations are mixed, followed by a balanced split operation to obtain two equal-sized droplets. In this work, we introduce a simulation-guided optimization procedure (SIMOP) for achieving the target concentrations while optimizing multiple factors according to user-specified priority levels. The SIMOP algorithm produces a given concentration while optimizing each criterion as desired. Experimental results favorably demonstrate the performance of the proposed procedure compared to many previous algorithms used for single-target dilution. We also study the impact of errors caused by unbalanced droplet splitting on the accuracy of target concentration obtained by SIMOP sequences. Experimental study reveals that SIMOP outperforms previous algorithms from the perspective of volumetric error management that may occur in reaction paths. The proposed technique may find many potential applications to robust sample preparation needed in diverse areas of biomedical engineering and healthcare domains.},

  abstract = {Significance             Microfluidic systems promise to improve the analysis and synthesis of materials, biological or otherwise, by lowering the required volume of fluid samples, offering a tightly controlled fluid-handling environment, and simultaneously integrating various chemical processes. To build these systems, designers depend on microfabrication techniques that restrict them to arranging their designs in two dimensions and completely fabricating their design in a single step. This study introduces modular, reconfigurable components containing fluidic and sensor elements adaptable to many different microfluidic circuits. These elements can be assembled to allow for 3D routing of channels. This assembly approach allows for the application of network analysis techniques like those used in classical electronic circuit design, facilitating the straightforward design of predictable flow systems.           ,              Microfluidic systems are rapidly becoming commonplace tools for high-precision materials synthesis, biochemical sample preparation, and biophysical analysis. Typically, microfluidic systems are constructed in monolithic form by means of microfabrication and, increasingly, by additive techniques. These methods restrict the design and assembly of truly complex systems by placing unnecessary emphasis on complete functional integration of operational elements in a planar environment. Here, we present a solution based on discrete elements that liberates designers to build large-scale microfluidic systems in three dimensions that are modular, diverse, and predictable by simple network analysis techniques. We develop a sample library of standardized components and connectors manufactured using stereolithography. We predict and validate the flow characteristics of these individual components to design and construct a tunable concentration gradient generator with a scalable number of parallel outputs. We show that these systems are rapidly reconfigurable by constructing three variations of a device for generating monodisperse microdroplets in two distinct size regimes and in a high-throughput mode by simple replacement of emulsifier subcircuits. Finally, we demonstrate the capability for active process monitoring by constructing an optical sensing element for detecting water droplets in a fluorocarbon stream and quantifying their size and frequency. By moving away from large-scale integration toward standardized discrete elements, we demonstrate the potential to reduce the practice of designing and assembling complex 3D microfluidic circuits to a methodology comparable to that found in the electronics industry.},

In this paper, we address the migration problem that arises when the technology undergoes a change in the context of digital microfluidics. Given a bio-chemical reaction synthesized for actuation on a given DMF architecture, we discuss how the same bio-chemical reaction can be ported seamlessly to an enhanced architecture, with possible modifications to the architectural parameters (e.g., clock frequency, mixer size, and mixing time) or geometric changes (e.g., change in reservoir locations or mixer positions, inclusion of new sensors or other physical resources). Complete resynthesis of the protocol for the new architecture may often become either inefficient or even infeasible due to scalability, proprietary, security, or cost issues. We propose an adaptation method for handling such technologychanges by modifying the existing actuation sequence through an incremental procedure. The foundation of our method lies in symbolic encoding and satisfiability (SAT)-solvers, enriched with pertinent graph-theoretic and geometric techniques. This enables us to generate functionally correct solutions for the new target architecture without necessitating a complete resynthesis step, thereby enabling the utilization of these chips by users in biology who are not familiar with the on-chip synthesis toolflow. We highlight the benefits of the proposed approach through extensive simulations on assay benchmarks.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic systems (DMS), where liquid droplets are manipulated on a planar surface, are the recent generation of microfluidic systems. Specifically, the systems where electrowetting force is employed for the actuation of droplets on a 2-D array of electrodes are capable of performing many of the basic fluidic operations. In these systems, the actuation force on the liquid droplet is a function of the applied voltage and its frequency, dielectric properties of the liquid and the insulating material, and finally the instantaneous position of the droplet between two adjacent electrodes. At lower frequencies the applied voltage is dropped almost entirely in the insulating layer for droplets of aqueous liquids. The unit area capacitance of the insulating layer depends linearly on the dielectric constant and inversely on the thickness. Therefore, for a given voltage and frequency, stronger actuation force can be generated if a thinner layer of material with high dielectric strength is used. However, the electric-field strength of the material poses the limitation on reducing the thickness of insulating layer. Typical insulators, with high electric field strength, used in microelectromechanical systems require quite sophisticated equipment for their deposition on the substrates. On the other hand, spin-coating of polymer insulators have been adopted as an economic and faster alternative technique for the fabrication of DMS. Polymer insulators possess reasonable dielectric strength and lower thickness can be achieved from higher spin speeds. However, low electric-field strengths of these materials prohibit working with thinner layers. As a result, actuation of droplets in DMS, fabricated using these materials as insulators, requires higher voltages. Higher applied voltages are not desirable for portable systems dealing with sensitive liquid samples. This paper presents an investigation on different insulating materials in terms of the ease of fabrication and the minimum voltage requirements for operation. The results can be useful in choosing the insulating material that will result in the expected level of performance while meeting the resource constraints. As a result, this paper specifies the material, based on the comparative study, that can be used to avoid the need for a sophisticated deposition system and the fabricated DMS can be operated with much lower voltages.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) are now being extensively used to automate several biochemical laboratory protocols such as clinical analysis, point-of-care diagnostics, or DNA sequencing. In many biological assays, e.g., bacterial susceptibility tests and cellular response analysis, samples or reagents are required in multiple concentration (or dilution) factors, satisfying certain gradient patterns such as linear, exponential, or parabolic. Dilution gradients are traditionally prepared using continuous-flow microfluidic devices. Unfortunately, most of them suffer from inflexibility and non-programmability, and they require large volumes of costly stock-solutions. DMFBs, on the other hand, are shown to produce, more efficiently, samples with multiple dilution factors. However, none of the existing DMFBbased algorithms utilize the properties of the gradient-profile while optimizing reactant-cost and sample-preparation time. In this work, we explore the underlying combinatorial attributes of different gradients and harnessed them for efficient production of the desired concentration profile. For linear gradients, we present theoretical results concerning the number of mix-split operations and waste production, and prove an upper bound on on-chip storage requirement. A cost-effective method for generating a wide class of exponential gradients is also proposed. Finally, in order to handle a complex-shaped gradient, we posit a digitalgeometric technique to approximate it with a sequence of linear gradients. Experimental results on various gradient-profiles are presented in support of the proposed method.},

For a major class of DMFBs droplet actuation is depend on the rule of electrowetting-on-dielectric, where separate droplets of nano liter volume can be manipulated using 2D array of electrodes. Most important design automation issues in DMFBs is the concurrent routing of droplets inside a 2D array. The reason of droplet steering is needed to plan the movement of a number of droplets in a time synchronized mode within a 2D array while minimizing resource consumption and within optimum latest arrival time. The droplets may be classified as homogeneous or heterogeneous. In case of heterogeneous droplet routing, major issue is the avoidance of cross contamination where as for homogeneous droplet routing sharing of electrodes among different route paths for minimum resource utilization remains the main focus. In our paper, we put forward an algorithm for routing of heterogeneous droplet inDMFBs. We further developed a routing simulator that graphically displays detailed route performance for heterogeneous droplets within a predefined DMFB layout. We have used benchmark suite I and III to analysis our algorithm.},

The ddPCR platform, which uses a mineral oil-saturated polydimethylsiloxane (OSP) chip to overcome the problem of droplet evaporation, integrates the functions of droplet generation, onchip amplification and end-point fluorescence readout. Simultaneous detection of two kinds of bacterial is achieved by the design of differentially labeled TaqMan-MGB fluorescent probes. Compared with a quantitative real-time PCR approach, the OSP chip-based duplex ddPCR platform exhibits high sensitivity, which is at the level of single molecule resolution without significant cross-assay interference. Moreover, the applicability of the proposed method is also evaluated in artificially contaminated drinking water sample, which displays a low detection limit down to 10 CFU/mL for both pathogenic bacterial within 2 h.},

Important applications for silver-based GDEs are the chlor-alkali and the CO               2               electrolysis processes in which silver catalyzes the oxygen- or carbon dioxide reduction reaction. The wetting of the porous GDEs is of utmost importance for the achieved performance of the electrode: a completely dry electrode will result in low current densities due to the reduced active surface area while on the other hand, a completely flooded electrode will deteriorate the access of the gaseous reactant. Therefore, we investigated silver-based GDEs for the oxygen reduction reaction with different amounts of the hydrophobic agent polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and analyzed the potential-induced wetting behavior (electrowetting). The electrolyte breakthrough was recorded by a digital microscope and subsequently evaluated via imaging analysis of the observed breached electrolyte droplets. In order to characterize the wetting state during transition to the steady-state, we applied electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements and retrieved the double-layer capacitance. Our results indicate that a higher overvoltage facilitates the breakthrough of electrolytes through the gas-diffusion electrode. Surprisingly, a faster breakthrough of electrolyte was observed for electrodes with higher PTFE content. Porometry measurements revealed that the GDE with low PTFE content has a monomodal pore size distribution, whereas electrodes with higher PTFE amount exhibit a bimodal pore size distribution. In GDEs with monomodal pore size distribution the time in which the double layer capacitance is leveling off correlates with the breakthrough time of the electrolyte. In summary, we emphasize that the wetting of GDEs is a complex interplay of the applied potential, electrode composition, and resulting porous structure which requires further advanced measurements and analysis considering the parameters affecting the wetting behavior as a whole.},

Periodic rise and falls in hotspot temperature were measured when multiple water droplets moved over the hotspot surface while a constant heat flux was applied at the hotspot. Synchronized high-speed video data of droplet motion shows that phase-change heat transfer (i.e. evaporation) at the water droplet meniscus coincided with additional temperature drop at the hotspot. Furthermore, the heat transfer coefficient of water droplet evaporation was measured on a hydrophilic hotspot surface. The hydrophilic surface regulated the hotspot temperature within a lower envelope for a longer time.},

To validate the model, we compare the simulation results with the experimental outcomes we obtained from a simple but representative microfluidic circuit, which has been realized in our laboratory, and with other circuits tested in previous works.

The method is especially useful for the simulation of microfluidic systems driven by electrowetting on dielectrics because it accounts automatically and inherently for the highly non-trivial interface shape in the vicinity of the triple-phase contact. In particular, the voltage independence of the local contact angle predicted based on analytical considerations is correctly reproduced in all our simulations. For the calculation of the shape of the interface, the geometry is triangulated and the mesh nodes are shifted until the system energy becomes minimal. The same mesh is also used to calculate the electric field using the boundary-element method. Therefore, only the surface of the geometry needs to be meshed, and no volume meshes are involved. The method can be used for the simulation of closed systems with a constant volume (e.g., droplet-based microfluidics) while preserving the volume very precisely as well as open systems (e.g., the liquid--air interface within micro-cavities or capillaries). Additional effects, such as the influence of gravitational forces, can easily be taken into account. In contrast to other efficient simulations, such as the volume-of-fluid, level-set, or phase-field methods, ideally, sharp interfaces are obtained. We calculate interface shapes for exemplary systems and compare with analytical as well as experimental results.},

An array of electrodes patterned on a printed-circuit board was used to control the formation, transportation, merging, mixing, and splitting of submicroliter-sized droplets contained within an oil-filled chamber. A three-enzyme pyrosequencing protocol was implemented in which individual droplets contained enzymes, deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), and DNA templates. The DNA templates were anchored to magnetic beads which enabled them to be thoroughly washed between nucleotide additions. Reagents and protocols were optimized to maximize signal over background, linearity of response, cycle efficiency, and wash efficiency. As an initial demonstration of feasibility, a portion of a 229 bp Candida parapsilosis template was sequenced using both a de novo protocol and a resequencing protocol. The resequencing protocol generated over 60 bp of sequence with 100\% sequence accuracy based on raw pyrogram levels. Excellent linearity was observed for all of the homopolymers (two, three, or four nucleotides) contained in the C. parapsilosis sequence. With improvements in microfluidic design it is expected that longer reads, higher throughput, and improved process integration (i.e., ``sample-to-sequence'' capability) could eventually be achieved using this low-cost platform.},

In this review, we focus on recent developments in order to achieve {\textmu}PADs with high-throughput capability. We discuss existing fabrication techniques and designs, and we introduce and discuss current detection methods and their applications to multiplexed detection assays in relation to clinical diagnosis, drug analysis and screening, environmental monitoring, and food and beverage quality control.

Microfluidic chip technology has already proven to be functional and effective within medical applications, such as for point-of-care use. In the forensic field, one may expect microfluidic technology to become particularly relevant for the analysis of biological traces containing human DNA. This would require a number of consecutive steps, including sample work up, DNA amplification and detection, as well as secure storage of the sample. This article provides an extensive overview of microfluidic devices for cell lysis, DNA extraction and purification, DNA amplification and detection and analysis techniques for DNA. Topics to be discussed are polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on-chip, digital PCR (dPCR), isothermal amplification on-chip, chip materials, integrated devices and commercially available techniques. A critical overview of the opportunities and challenges of the use of chips is discussed, and developments made in forensic DNA analysis over the past 10--20 years with microfluidic systems are described. Areas in which further research is needed are indicated in a future outlook.},

  abstract = {The ongoing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic illustrates the need for sensitive and reliable tools to diagnose and monitor diseases. Traditional diagnostic approaches rely on centralized laboratory tests that result in long wait times to results and reduce the number of tests that can be given. Point-of-care tests (POCTs) are a group of technologies that miniaturize clinical assays into portable form factors that can be run both in clinical areas ---in place of traditional tests---and outside of traditional clinical settings ---to enable new testing paradigms. Hallmark examples of POCTs are the pregnancy test lateral flow assay and the blood glucose meter. Other uses for POCTs include diagnostic assays for diseases like COVID-19, HIV, and malaria but despite some successes, there are still unsolved challenges for fully translating these lower cost and more versatile solutions. To overcome these challenges, researchers have exploited innovations in colloid and interface science to develop various designs of POCTs for clinical applications. Herein, we provide a review of recent advancements in lateral flow assays, other paper based POCTs, protein microarray assays, microbead flow assays, and nucleic acid amplification assays. Features that are desirable to integrate into future POCTs, including simplified sample collection, end-to-end connectivity, and machine learning, are also discussed in this review.},

It offers much promise for applications in lab-on-a-chip devices, liquid lenses, and optical displays. The contact angle can be controlled electrically facilitating the transport of liquid droplets by electrocapillary forces. This paper focuses on the requirements of the dielectric layers in electrowetting on dielectric; firstly, to provide the required dielectric qualities, that is, sufficient dielectric strength and high capacitance and, secondly, to satisfy the surface wetting characteristics, that is, sufficiently high hydrophobicity and low contact angle hysteresis. We present experimental work that, firstly, compares the dielectric characteristics of several insulating layers and secondly, proposes silanization as a way to form hydrophobic layers for electrowetting. The relation between electrowetting and dielectric breakdown was tested by means of measuring the contact angle of a water droplet placed between two electrodes on an insulated surface. The leakage current and resistance between these electrodes were measured as a function of applied voltage for the following dielectric coatings: silicon dioxide, silicon nitride and Parylene C. We compare the contact angle response of electrowetting on octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) monolayers and plasmaenhanced chemical vapour deposition Teflon-like fluoropolymer layers. The contact angle hysteresis of the OTS monolayers is clearly lower and this results in reversible electrowetting, that is, the hydrophobicity is sufficient to avoid contact line pinning and dewetting occurs on removal of an applied potential.},

A series of characterizations were also conducted with the fabricated digital microfluidic devices. For the device fabrication, the electrodes were patterned by laser ablation of 220 nm-thick indium tin oxide (ITO) layer on a 175 {\textmu}m-thick polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate. The electrodes were insulated with a layer of 12 {\textmu}m-thick polyethylene (PE) film as the dielectric layer, and finally, a surface treatment was conducted on PE film in order to enhance the hydrophobicity. The whole digital microfluidic device has a total thickness of less than 200 {\textmu}m and is nearly transparent in the visible range. The droplet manipulation with the proposed digital microfluidic device was also achieved. In addition, a series of characterization studies were conducted as follows: the contact angles under different driving voltages, the leakage current density across the patterned electrodes, and the minimum driving voltage with different control algorithms and droplet volume were measured and discussed. The UV--VIS spectrum of the proposed digital microfluidic devices was also provided in order to verify the transparency of the fabricated device. Compared with conventional methods for the fabrication of digital microfluidic devices, which usually have opaque metal/carbon electrodes, the proposed transparent and flexible digital microfluidics could have significant advantages for the observation of the droplets on the digital microfluidic device, especially for colorimetric analysis using the digital microfluidic approach.},

In the presented system, the PDMS layer acts as both insulation and hydrophobic material. An electronic board controls all the signals needed for the actuation and sensing functionalities of the EWOD system. Sessile drop experiments show the saturation of the contact angle at negative bias voltage applied to the droplet. This behavior is ascribed to trapped carrier in the PDMS layer and explains the movement of the droplet toward the grounded electrode found in EWOD experiment. The procedure chosen for the drop movement achieves speed around 5cm/s with applied voltages around 200V. Detection of drop position is successfully achieved implementing the time-constant method, which evaluates the variation of electrode capacitance induced by the droplet presence on the PDMS surface corresponding to the metal electrode.},

Furthermore, because the devices are made from cellulose or modified cellulose using inexpensive manufacturing methods, the devices can be inexpensive and disposable. The ability to carry out multiplexed analysis without external pumps using inexpensive, disposable devices makes {$\mu$}PADs ideal for point-of-care (POC) analysis. The interest in {$\mu$}PADs has led to a number of excellent comprehensive reviews in the field; in this review, we do not attempt to reference the entire field but instead seek to highlight major developments as well as areas that will be important for future development of this field.},

The complexity of microfluidic devices is expected to become significant in the near future due to the need for multiple and concurrent biochemical assays on multifunctional and reconfigurable platforms. This paper presents early work on topdown system-level computer-aided design (CAD) tools for the synthesis, testing and reconfguration of microfluidic biochips. Synthesis tools map behavioral descriptions to a droplet-based microfluidic biochip and generate an optimized schedule of assay operations, the binding of assay operations to functional units, and the layout and droplet flow-paths. Cost-effective testing techniques lead to the detection of manufacturing defects and operational faults. Reconfiguration techniques, incorporated in these CAD tools, can easily bypass faults once they are detected. Thus the biochip user can concentrate on the development of the nano- and micro-scale bioassays, leaving assay optimization and implementation details to design automation tools.},

This article presents the characteristics of EWOD device with aluminum oxide (Al2O3, er \& 10) deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD), for the first time as the high-k dielectric for lowering the EWOD driving voltage substantially. The EWOD device of the single-plate configuration was fabricated by several steps for the control electrode array of 1 mm 9 1 mm squares with 50 lm space, the dielectric layer of 1,270 A{\r{}} thick ALD Al2O3, the reference electrode of 20 lm wide line electrode, and the hydrophobic surface treatment by Teflon-AF coating, respectively. We observed the movement of a 2 ll water droplet in an air environment, applying a voltage between one of the control electrodes and the reference electrode in contact with the droplet. The droplet velocity exponentially depending on the applied voltage below 15 V was obtained. The measured threshold voltage to move the droplet was as low as 3 V which is the lowest voltage reported so far in the EWOD researches. This result opens a possibility of manipulating droplets, without any surfactant or oil treatment, at only a few volts by EWOD using ALD Al2O3 as the dielectric.},

Starting from the onset of thin-film behavior (or equivalently beyond the inertia-dominated initial stage), we identify the existence of mutually contrasting multiple scaling regimes defining the spreading behavior at different time scales. This is attributable to the time-stage-wise upsurge of capillarity or thermocapillarity over the other. In particular, the spreading behavior is characterized by the foot-width (w) evolution with time (t) in a power-law fashion w {$\sim$} t{$\alpha$}, with {$\alpha$} being the spreading exponent, defining the rate of spreading. Following pertinent thin-film and subsequent similarity analysis, we identify different asymptotes of {$\alpha$} over disparate temporal scales, leading to the characterization of different scaling regimes over the entire spreading event starting from the inception of thin-film behavior. Reported literature data are found to correspond well to the present interpretations and estimations.},

  abstract = {This paper demonstrates an integrated device combining both EWD droplet actuation and intra-droplet magnetic bead manipulation. Magnetic bead manipulation is achieved by using current-carrying wires acting as microelectromagnets. The current wire structure is capable of segregating and separating magnetic beads within a droplet. By adjusting the amount of current in the wire structure, high segregation efficiency within the droplet is shown and the separation of two kinds of beads is realized within a distance of 65 {\textmu}m. The EWD droplet actuation function and the magnetic bead separation function can be operated independently, which provides flexibility when designing operation protocols. The current wire structure is embedded in an EWD electrode without affecting droplet actuation. The vertical structure of the device and its fabrication process are also the same as a normal EWD device. Magnetic bead segregation efficiency of 96.8 \% was achieved for 2.8-{\textmu}m beads that were collected over a distance of 65 {\textmu}m during a 20-s current pulse. Droplet splitting is shown to allow complete separation of beads into one of the two daughter droplets. And, intra-droplet separation of 1- and 2.8-{\textmu}m beads was demonstrated over an average distance of 65 {\textmu}m. This experiment shows the feasibility of performing separation in droplets with a complex mixture of multiple beads, each having different magnetic contents.},

In this article we explore the physical mechanisms affecting thermocapillary migration of droplets generated by surface temperature gradients on the supporting substrate. Using a combination of experiment and modeling, we investigate the behavior of the threshold force required for droplet mobilization and the speed after depinning as a function of the droplet size, the applied thermal gradient and the liquid material parameters. The experimental results are well described by a hydrodynamic model based on earlier work by Ford and Nadim. The model describes the steady motion of a two-dimensional droplet driven by thermocapillary stresses including contact angle hysteresis. The results of this study highlight the critical role of chemical or mechanical hysteresis and the need to reduce this retentive force for minimizing power requirements in microfluidic devices.},

As a simple example, by applying a voltage between a conducting liquid droplet and the surface it is sitting on we are able to adjust the wetting angle of the drop. Since Lippmann's findings, electrocapillary phenomena -- or electrowetting -- have developed into a series of tools for manipulating microdroplets on solid surfaces, or small amounts of liquids in capillaries for microfluidic applications. In this article, we briefly review some recent progress of fundamental understanding of electrowetting and address some still unsolved issues. Specifically, we focus on static and dynamic electrowetting. In static electrowetting, we discuss some basic phenomena found in DC and AC electrowetting, and some theories about the origin of contact angle saturation. In dynamic electrowetting, we introduce some studies about this rather recent area. At last, we address some other capillary phenomena governed by electrostatics and we give an outlook that might stimulate further investigations on electrowetting.},

In this study, we developed a fast and sensitive bacteria detection method integrating electrochemical impedance analysis, urease catalysis with microfluidics and using Listeria as model. The Listeria cells, the anti-Listeria monoclonal antibodies modified magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), and the anti-Listeria polyclonal antibodies and urease modified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were incubated in a fluidic separation chip with active mixing to form the MNP-Listeria-AuNP-urease sandwich complexes. The complexes were captured in the separation chip by applying a high gradient magnetic field, and the urea was injected to resuspend the complexes and hydrolyzed under the catalysis of the urease on the complexes into ammonium ions and carbonate ions, which were transported into a microfluidic detection chip with an interdigitated microelectrode for impedance measurement to determine the amount of the Listeria cells. The capture efficiency of the Listeria cells in the separation chip was {$\sim$}93\% with a shorter time of 30 min due to the faster immuno-reaction using the active magnetic mixing. The changes on both impedance magnitude and phase angle were demonstrated to be able to detect the Listeria cells as low as 1.6 {\^A} 102 CFU/mL. The detection time was reduced from original {$\sim$}2 h to current {$\sim$}1 h. The recoveries of the spiked lettuce samples ranged from 82.1\% to 89.6\%, indicating the applicability of this proposed biosensor. This microfluidic impedance biosensor has shown the potential for online, automatic and sensitive bacteria separation and detection.},

This process was repeatedly performed to create three-dimensional nanofiber-based microfluidic analysis devices (3D-{\textmu}NMADs). Flexible printing enabled one-step fabrication without the need for additional alignment or adhesive bonding. Practical applications of 3D-{\textmu}NMADs include a colorimetric platform to quantitatively detect iron ion concentrations in water. There is also great potential for personalized point-of-care testing. Overall, the devices offer simple fabrication processes, flexible prototyping, potential for mass production, and multi-material integration.},

DMF conventionally utilizes the three-electrode method to split droplets one by one -- it has low throughput and noticeable droplet volume variations. To address this challenge, a novel splitting method with a zigzag row-electrode design on electrowetting-based DMF chips is proposed. The liquid is first stretched on the row-electrode, then split by the electrode array. The row-electrode promotes the meniscus filling phe\- nomena, providing larger overlapping areas, thereby stabilizing the volume of droplets generated. Twenty (20) droplets of 6--8 nL with the volumetric coefficient of variance (CV) at only 1.26\% are simultaneously generated, excluding the droplets at both ends. Theoretical analysis is developed and validated by the experiments to realize the relationship of important geometrical parameters. This method can not only rapidly produce multiple daughter droplets with excellent droplet volume consistence, but also preserve the common DMF fabrication and actuation scheme without modification. It shows great promise for the DMF applications that require highthroughput downstream processes.},

The wettability of the baseline hydrophobic surface above the electrode will change to hydrophilicity once a voltage is applied. The differences in heat transfer and boiling phenomenon between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces without electrodes are illustrated firstly by the density contours and boiling curves. Then, the possibility of electrowetting in improving the heat transfer coefficient (HTC) and critical heat flux (CHF) is verified by comparing with baseline hydrophobic and patterned-coating surfaces, and different boiling heat transfer regimes are illustrated in detail. Furthermore, based on the heat transfer characteristics of the electrowetting surfaces with different electrode configurations, a surface with temperature-dependent electrodes is obtained to comprehensively enhance heat transfer from the onset of nucleate boiling (ONB) to CHF.},

Device miniaturization and increasing design complexity have mandated a shift in digital microfluidic lab-on-a-chip design from traditional manual design to computer-aided design (CAD) methodologies. As an important procedure in the lab-on-a-chip layout CAD, the lab-on-a-chip component placement determines the physical location and the starting time of each operation such that the overall completion time is minimized while satisfying nonoverlapping constraint, resource constraint, and scheduling constraint. In this paper, a multiscale variation-aware optimization technique based on integer linear programming is proposed for the lab-on-a-chip component placement. The simulation results demonstrate that without considering variations, our technique always satisfies the design constraints and largely outperforms the state-of-the-art approach, with up to 65.9\% reduction in completion time. When considering variations, the variation-unaware design has the average yield of 2\%, while our variation-aware technique always satisfies the yield constraint with only 7.7\% completion time increase.},

Heat from a 30-V direct-current source, applied to a 2 {\texttimes} 0.1-mm region of the fluid, was instrumental in rupturing a low-surface-energy liquid membrane and forming the droplet. The low voltage allows quick and accurate dispensing of droplets without dielectric breakdown. Nanoliter-sized ({\textasciitilde}7.6-nL) butanol-styrene droplets were formed using 133 Vrms at 900 Hz. Microliter-sized oil droplets ({\textasciitilde}0.6 to 10.5 {$\mu$}L) were formed using high voltage (460 to 672 Vrms at 100 Hz). Oil-water emulsions were formed and moved horizontally, overcoming frictional and surface tension forces. Large oil droplets were also moved to a wider electrode spacing, where the emulsion can take the spherical shape of a target. This was only achieved by transporting the emulsion down an inclined slope (45 deg) using gravity to augment the electric force. All the steps are in place to form targets from oil-water-oil and water-oil-water emulsions; only the dielectrophoretic centering and polymerization processes, which were demonstrated previously, must be added.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a high-performance droplet router for digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) design. Due to recent advancements in bio-MEMS, the design complexity and the scale of a DMFB are expected to explode in near future, thus requiring strong support from CAD as in conventional VLSI design. Among multiple design stages of a DMFB, droplet routing which schedules the movement of each droplet in a time-multiplexed manner is a critical challenge due to high complexity as well as large impacts on performance. Our algorithm first routes a droplet with higher bypassibility which less likely blocks the movement of the others. When multiple droplets form a deadlock, our algorithm resolves it by backing off some droplets for concession. A final compaction step further enhances timing as well as fault-tolerance by tuning each droplet movement greedily. Experimental results on hard benchmarks show that our algorithm achieves over 35x and 20x better routability with comparable timing and fault-tolerance than the popular prioritized A* search [2] and the state-of-the-art network-flow based algorithm [18], respectively.},

  abstract = {A new droplet-driving scheme for digital microfluidics termed the ``pre-charging of a droplet'' is demonstrated. In this method, a droplet is initially charged by applying ``pre-charging'' voltage between the droplet and an electrode buried under dielectric layers. The droplet is then driven to the next electrode by applying ``driving'' voltage between two adjacent buried electrodes. The concept of pre-charging was proved by the polarity of the charge stored in the droplet. When the droplet is precharged with positive voltage, it is driven with negative voltage and vice versa. Therefore, the magnitudes of the pre-charging and driving voltages are identical, but only with the opposite polarity. A 2.5-lL deionized water droplet is pre-charged and driven at a minimal voltage of 12 V. The charge stored in the droplet by this pre-charging method remained for more than 2 min, and the driving actuation could be repeated more than 150 times while the droplet remained its charged state. This method suggests a new means of driving a droplet for digital microfluidics at a relatively low voltage by utilizing both the electrostatic and dielectrophoretic force in the droplet transport process with a simpler structure compared to other single-plate structured devices.},

  abstract = {The digital nucleic acid assay is a precise, sensitive, and reproducible method for determining the presence of individual target molecules separated in designated partitions; thus, this technique can be used for the nucleic acid detection. Here, we propose a multifunctional micropattern array capable of isolating individual target molecules into partitions and simultaneous on-site cell lysis to achieve a direct DNA extraction and digitized quantification thereof. The multifunctional micropattern array is fabricated by the deposition of a copolymer film, poly(2dimethylaminomethyl styrene-co-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pDH), directly on a microfluidic chip surface via the photoinitiated chemical vapor deposition process, followed by hydrophobic microcontact printing ({$\mu$}CP) to define each partition for the nucleic acid isolation. The pDH layer is a positively charged surface, which is desirable for the bacterial lysis and DNA capture, while showing exceptional water stability for more than 24 h. The hydrophobic {$\mu$}CP-treated pDH surface is stable under aqueous conditions at a high temperature (70 {$^\circ$}C) for 1 h and enables the rapid and reliable formation of thousands of sessile microdroplets for the compartmentalization of an aqueous sample solution without involving bulky and costly microfluidic devices. By assembling the multifunctional micropattern array into the microfluidic chip, the isothermal amplification in each partition can detect DNA templates over a concentration range of 0.01-2 ng/{$\mu$}L. The untreated bacterial cells can also be directly compartmentalized via the microdroplet formation, followed by the on-site cell lysis and DNA capture on the compartmentalized pDH surface. For Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enteritidis, and Staphylococcus aureus cells, cell numbers ranging from 1.4 {\texttimes} 104 to 1.4 {\texttimes} 107 can be distinguished by using the multifunctional micropattern array, regardless of the cell type. The multifunctional micropattern array developed in this study provides a novel multifunctional compartmentalization method for rapid, simple, and accurate digital nucleic acid assays.},

Numerical modeling of complex physical phenomena like contact line dynamics, dynamic contact angles or contact angle hysteresis involved in these processes do challenge in a significant manner classical numerical approaches based on macroscopic Navier--Stokes partial differential equations. In this paper, we analyze the efficiency of a numerical lattice Boltzmann model to simulate basic transport operations of sub-millimeter liquid droplets in electrowetting actuated Hele-Shaw cells. We use a two-phase three-dimensional D3Q19 lattice Boltzmann scheme driven by a Shan--Chentype mesoscopic potential in order to simulate the gas--liquid equilibrium state of a liquid droplet confined between two solid plates. The contact angles at the liquid--solid--gas interface are simulated by taking into consideration the interaction between fluid particles and solid nodes. The electrodes are designed as regions of tunable wettability on the bottom plate and the contact angles adjusted by changing the interaction strength of the liquid with these regions. The transport velocities obtained with this approach are compared to predictions from analytical models and very good agreement is obtained.},

The fusion of microfluidic technologies (digital microfluidics, continuous-flow microfluidics, and droplet microfluidics, just to name a few) presents great potential for overcoming the inherent limitations of each approach, while also elevating their respective strengths. This work exploits the combination of digital microfluidics (DMF) and droplet microfluidics (DrMF) on a single substrate, where DMF enables droplet mixing and further acts as a controlled liquid supplier for a high-throughput nano-liter droplet generator. Droplet generation is performed at a flow-focusing region, operating on dual pressure: negative pressure applied to the aqueous phase and positive pressure applied to the oil phase. We evaluate the droplets produced with our hybrid DMF--DrMF devices in terms of droplet volume, speed, and production frequency and further compare them with standalone DrMF devices. Both types of devices enable customizable droplet production (various volumes and circulation speeds), yet hybrid DMF--DrMF devices yield more controlled droplet production while achieving throughputs that are similar to standalone DrMF devices. These hybrid devices enable the production of up to four droplets per second, which reach a maximum circulation speed close to 1540 {\textmu}m/s and volumes as low as 0.5 nL.},

Here, we explore the thermal, structural, and electrical properties of Parylene C, and further present a variety of electronic devices featuring this polymer: transistors, capacitors, and digital microfluidic (DMF) devices. We evaluate transistors produced with Parylene C as a dielectric, substrate, and encapsulation layer, either semitransparent or fully transparent. Such transistors exhibit steep transfer curves and subthreshold slopes of 0.26 V/dec, negligible gate leak currents, and fair mobilities. Furthermore, we characterize MIM (metal--insulator--metal) structures with Parylene C as a dielectric and demonstrate the functionality of the polymer deposited in single and double layers under temperature and AC signal stimuli, mimicking the DMF stimuli. Applying temperature generally leads to a decrease in the capacitance of the dielectric layer, whereas applying an AC signal leads to an increase in said capacitance for double-layered Parylene C only. By applying the two stimuli, the capacitance seems to suffer from a balanced influence of both the separated stimuli. Lastly, we demonstrate that DMF devices with double-layered Parylene C allow for faster droplet motion and enable long nucleic acid amplification reactions.},

Most designs ground the droplet by either sandwiching the droplet with a grounding plate on top or by inserting a wire into the droplet. Washizu and others have developed systems capable of generating droplet motion without a top plate while allowing the droplet potential to float. In contrast to these designs, we demonstrate an electrowetting system in which the droplet can be electrically grounded from below using thin conductive lines on top of the dielectric layer. This alternative method of electrically grounding the droplet, which we refer to as groundingfrom-below, enables more robust droplet translation without requiring a top plate or wire. We present a concise electrical-energy analysis that accurately describes the distinction between grounded and nongrounded designs, the improvements in droplet motion, and the simplified control strategy associated with grounding-from-below designs. Electrowetting on a single planar surface offers flexibility for interfacing to liquidhandling instruments, utilizing droplet inertial dynamics to achieve enhanced mixing of two droplets upon coalescence, and increasing droplet translation speeds. In this paper, we present experimental results and a number of design issues associated with the grounding-frombelow approach.},

Recent air sampling techniques developed for biocollection take advantage of Electrowetting on Dielectric (EWOD) to recover material, producing highly concentrated droplet samples. Bespoke EWOD-based digital microfluidics platforms are very well suited to take full advantage of the microlitre concentrated droplet resulting from this recovery process. In this paper we present a free-standing, fully automated DMF platform for immunoassay. Using this system, we demonstrate the automated detection of four classes of CBW agent simulant biomolecules and organisms each representing credible threat agents. Taking advantage of the full magnetic separation process with antibody-bound microbeads, rapid and complete separation of specific target antigen can be achieved with minimal washing steps allowing for very rapid detection. Here, we report clear detection of four categories of antigens achieved with assay completion times of between six and ten minutes. Detection of HSA, Bacillus atrophaeus (BG spores), MS2 bacteriophage and Escherichia coli are demonstrated with estimated limit of detection of respectively 30 ng ml-1, 4 {\texttimes} 104 cfu ml-1, 106 pfu ml-1 and 2 {\texttimes} 107 cfu ml-1. The fully-integrated portable platform described in this paper is highly compatible with the next generation of electrowetting-coupled air samplers and thus shows strong potential toward future in-field deployable biodetection systems and could have key implication in lifechanging sectors such as healthcare, environment or food security.},

Although many static and dynamic models focusing on droplet motion induced by electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) already exist, some dynamic features do not fit these models well, especially the dynamic saturation phenomenon. In this paper, a dynamic saturation model of droplet motion on the single-plate EWOD device is presented. The phenomenon that droplet velocity is limited by a dynamic saturation effect is precisely predicted. Based on this model, the relationship between droplet motion and device physics is extensively discussed. The static saturation phenomenon is treated with a double-layer capacitance electric model, and it is demonstrated as one critical factor determining the dynamics of droplet motion. This work presents the relationship between dynamics of electrowetting induced droplet motion and device physics including device structure, surface material and interface electronics, which helps to better understand electrowetting induced droplet motions and physics of digital microfluidics systems.},

Consequently, clinical specimens must be processed by skilled technicians before antigens or nucleic acids are detected, and these are often present at dilute concentrations. Recently, several automated microchip technologies have been developed that potentially offer many advantages over traditional bench-top extraction methods. The smaller length scales and more refined transport mechanisms that characterize these microfluidic devices enable faster and more efficient biomarker enrichment and extraction. Additionally, they can be designed to perform multiple tests or experimental steps on one integrated, automated platform.

Microgrooves patterns with different orientations and geometric parameters were fabricated on the surface of SUS 316 stainless steel. Migration experiments of paraffin oils on each specimen were performed under various temperature gradients. The results indicated that micro-grooves patterns strongly modified the thermo-capillary migration. Micro-grooves perpendicular to the temperature gradient obstructed the migration effectively, while micro-grooves parallel to the temperature gradient accelerated the migration.

The microheaters provide control of the surface temperature distribution with high spatial resolution. These temperature gradients locally alter the surface tension along droplets and thin films thus propelling the liquid toward the colder regions. In combination with liquophilic and liquophobic chemical surface patterning, this device can be used as a logistic platform for the parallel and automated routing, mixing and reacting of a multitude of liquid samples, including alkanes, poly(ethylene glycol) and water.},

The speed of the microstreams is studied as a function of the stripe width w, the applied thermal gradient {\textbar}dT/dx{\textbar} and the liquid volume V deposited on a connecting reservoir pad. Numerical solutions of the flow speed as a function of downstream position show excellent agreement with experiment. The only adjustable parameter is the inlet film height, which is controlled by the ratio of the reservoir pressure to the shear stress applied to the liquid stream. In the limiting cases where this ratio is either much smaller or much larger than unity, the rivulet speed shows a power law dependency on w, {\textbar}dT/dx{\textbar} and V. In this study we demonstrate that thermocapillary driven flow on chemically patterned surfaces can provide an elegant and tunable method for the transport of ultrasmall liquid volumes in emerging microfluidic technologies.},

As the requisite voltage reduction is a key challenging design issues, to implement all the tasks using triangular electrodes that are possible in square electrode arrays as well, is a tedious job.

Moreover, an algorithm has been developed to find a route for a given source and destination pair in this newly designed DMFB.

Biochips are soon expected to revolutionize biosensing, clinical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and drug discovery. Critical to the deployment of the biochips in such diverse areas is the dependability of these systems. Thus robust testing and diagnosis techniques are required to ensure adequate level of system dependability. Due to the underlying mixed technology and mixed energy domains, such biochips exhibit unique failure mechanisms and defects. In this article efficient parallel testing and diagnosis algorithms are presented that can detect and locate single as well as multiple faults in a microfluidic array without flooding the array, a problem that has hampered realistic implementation of several existing strategies. The fault diagnosis algorithms are well suited for built-in self-test that could drastically reduce the operating cost of microfluidic biochip. Also, the proposed alogirthms can be used both for testing and fault diagnosis during field operation as well as increasing yield during the manufacturing phase of the biochip. Furthermore, these algorithms can be applied to both online and offline testing and diagnosis. Analytical results suggest that these strategies that can be used to design highly dependable biochip systems.},

This is the first study of droplet collision and mixing phenomenon of levitated droplets on an immiscible thin liquid substrate undergoing Marangoni convection. The mixing percentage was determined by monitoring the changing color during chemical reaction that occurs in the resultant coalesced droplet. The thermocapillary effect of the liquid substrate plays a significant role in mixing in that the liquid surface velocity and the droplet velocity increase with an increase in the surface temperature gradient. This, in turn, increases the mixing of the coalesced droplet, which is further enhanced when the drop size is smaller. Since the collision is convection dominated, an appropriate time scale is proposed, which provides a universal correlation of the nondimensional mixing time in terms of Reynolds number.},

Despite their popularity, the selection of an appropriate mechanism for droplet transport and coalescence has always been a challenge. This paper investigates the use of Marangoni flow as a mechanism for levitating and transporting droplets on immiscible liquid films at higher speeds than is possible currently. For the first time, we show that it is possible to realize the natural coalescence of droplets through Marangoni effect without any external stimulation and deliver the coalesced droplet to a certain destination through the use of surface tension gradients. The effects of shape and size on collision outcome are studied. Regions of coalescence and stretching separation of colliding droplets are delineated based on Weber number and impact number. In addition, the effect of viscosity on post collision regimes is studied. The findings in this fundamental study can be beneficial to many applications such as welding, drug delivery and microfluidics devices in controlling small droplets and targeting them to various locations.},

Conventional laboratory-based pathogen detection analytical techniques are reliable, but are labour and time consuming. Decentralized, rapid pathogen detection and classification devices are essential to boost biosecurity efforts and can aid in the advancement of modern medicine. Here, we describe the development of an integrated digital microfluidic (DMF) electrochemical impedimetric sensor for rapid and on-site detection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a molecular signature of Gram-negative bacteria. The sensor was fabricated by immobilizing toll-like receptor protein (TLR4) onto a gold sensing electrode that was fabricated on an indium tin oxide (ITO) DMF top plate. The top plate also housed lithographically patterned ITO pseudo-reference and auxiliary electrodes for a three-electrode electrochemical impedance (EIS) detection system. We exploited the unique feature of DMF to manipulate droplets consisting of samples, buffers, wash solutions and reagents to perform automated EIS measurements due to the interaction of TLR4 with LPS. The integrated sensor platform showed a detection limit of 35 ng/mL LPS and a linear range of up to 400 ng/mL. The small size and ease of operation of the integrated system holds great prospect for the development of portable, and automated generic pathogen detection and classification platform for point-of-need applications.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidics (DMF) is a platform that enables highly reconfigurable and automated fluidic operations using a generic device architecture. A unique hallmark of DMF is its ``flexibility'': a generic device design can be used and reused for many different, divergent fluidic operations. The flexibility of DMF is compromised when devices are permanently modified with embedded sensors. Here we introduce a solution to the ``flexibility gap'' between fluidic operations in digital microfluidics and embedded sensors: ``plug-n-play DMF'' (PnP-DMF). In PnP-DMF, devices are designed to allow for rapid and seamless exchange of sensors depending on the application needs. This paper provides ``proof of concept'' for PnP-DMF using commercial biosensors for glucose and {$\beta$}-ketone, a custom paperbased electrochemical sensor for lactate, and a generic screen-printed electroanalytical cell. We demonstrate that hot-swapping sensors between experiments allows for convenient implementation of complex processes such as automated analysis of blood samples by standard addition. Finally, we explored the suitability for using PnP sensors in tandem with other sensing modalities, combining biosensor-based electrochemical measurement of glucose with a chemiluminescent magnetic bead-based sandwich immunoassay for insulin. The latter is notable, as it constitutes the first report of an analysis of different analytes in both the supernatant and precipitate from a single sample-aliquot in a microfluidic device. The results presented here highlight the versatility of PnP-DMF, illustrating how it may be useful for a wide range of applications in diagnostics and beyond.},

The aim is to develop a transportable system with analysis throughput which satisfies the requirements: (i) fully autonomous, (ii) complete protocol integration from sample collection to final analysis, (iii) detection of diluted molecules or biological species in a large real life environmental sample volume, (iv) robustness and (v) flexibility and versatility. This paper discusses all these specifications in order to define an original fluidic architecture based on three connected modules, a sampling module, a sample preparation module and a detection module. The sample preparation module highly concentrates on the pathogens present in a few mL samples of complex and unknown solutions and purifies the pathogens' nucleic acids into a few mL of a controlled buffer. To do so, a two-step concentration protocol based on magnetic beads is automated in a reusable macro-to-micro fluidic system. The detection module is a PCR based miniaturized platform using digital microfluidics, where reactions are performed in 64 nL droplets handled by electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) actuation. The design and manufacture of the two modules are reported as well as their respective performances. To demonstrate the integration of the complete protocol in the same system, first results of pathogen detection are shown.},

An attractive approach is optical actuation because light field interaction is contactless and dynamically reconfigurable, and solutions have been anticipated through the use of optical forces to manipulate microparticles in flows. Following the concept of "optical chip" advanced from the optical actuation of suspensions, we propose in this survey new routes to extend this concept to microfluidic two-phase flows. First, we investigate the destabilization of fluid interfaces by the optical radiation pressure and the formation of liquid jets. We analyze the droplet shedding from the jet tip and the continuous transport in laser-sustained liquid channels. In a second part, we investigate a dissipative light-flow interaction mechanism consisting in heating locally two immiscible fluids to produce thermocapillary stresses along their interface. This opto-capillary coupling is implemented in adequate microchannel geometries to manipulate two-phase flows and propose a contactless optical toolbox including valves, droplet sorters and switches, droplet dividers or droplet mergers. Finally, we discuss radiation pressure and opto-capillary effects in the context of the "optical-chip" where flows, channels and operating functions would all be performed optically on the same device.},

Here we explore the case where the dielectric is a soft elastic layer, which deforms elastically under the effect of electrostatic and capillary forces. The wetting behaviour is quantified by measurements of the static and dynamic contact angles, complemented by confocal microscopy to reveal the elastic deformations. Even though the mechanics near the contact line is highly intricate, the macroscopic contact angles can be understood from global conservation laws in the spirit of Young--Lippmann. The key finding is that, while elasticity has no effect on the static electrowetting angle, the substrate's viscoelasticity completely dictates the spreading dynamics of electrowetting.},

  abstract = {Improved environmental monitoring of microorganisms is currently an important issue, since traditional detection methods are costly and time consuming (often requiring 2-3 days). In contrast, microfluidic chip-based technologies provide promising alternatives. The presence of environmental contaminants, especially bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens and their toxins, is creating a major public health problem. The detection of microbial communities in environmental samples is the first step to recognizing these organisms and insuring health and safety against their infection. This review addresses both the existing and innovative technologies for the detection of pathogens present in the environmental samples. First, impacts and challenges related to pathogens in the environmental samples are discussed, and standard techniques for their identification are addressed. Next, the microfluidic technologies are introduced as an alternative strategy with a particular focus on the detection of environmental contaminants. Challenges that still need to be overcome are also discussed. The review concludes with a section on paper-based microfluidic device and a discussion on future prospects.},

The micro-object on top is therefore moved along the deformed droplet, which functions as a micromirror rotating around a liquid pivot.

Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) exploits the dielectric properties of thin insulator films to enhance the charge density and hence boost the electrowetting effect. The presence of charges results in an electrically induced spreading of the droplet which permits purposeful manipulation across a hydrophobic surface. Here, we demonstrate EWOD-based protocol for sample processing and detection of four categories of antigens, using an automated surface actuation platform, via two variations of an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) methods. The ELISA is performed on magnetic beads with immobilized primary antibodies which can be selected to target a specific antigen. An antibody conjugated to HRP binds to the antigen and is mixed with H2O2/Luminol for quantification of the captured pathogens. Assay completion times of between 6 and 10 min were achieved, whilst minuscule volumes of reagents were utilized.},

Importantly, the samples can be directly loaded onto the device by a finger ``dab'' for user-friendly operation.

While cost-effective and portable, LFAs often lack the clinical sensitivity and specificity required for accurate diagnoses. In response to this challenge, we introduce a new digital microfluidic (DMF) platform fabricated using a custom inkjet printing and roll-coating process that is scalable to mass production. The performance of the new devices is on par with that of traditional DMF devices fabricated in a cleanroom, with a materials cost for the new devices of only US \$0.63 per device. To evaluate the usefulness of the new platform, we performed a 13-step rubella virus (RV) IgG immunoassay on the inkjet printed, roll-coated devices, which yielded a limit of detection of 0.02 IU mL               -1               , well below the diagnostic cut-off of 10 IU mL               -1               for RV infection and immunity.

  abstract = {3D microblade structures were fabricated on digital microfluidic chips for precise and parallel droplet splitting of biological samples for disease diagnostics.           ,              Existing digital microfluidic (DMF) chips exploit the electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) force to perform droplet splitting. However, the current splitting methods are not flexible and the volume of the droplets suffers from a large variation. Herein, we propose a DMF chip featuring a 3D microblade structure to enhance the droplet-splitting performance. By exploiting the EWOD force for shaping and manipulating the mother droplet, we obtain an average dividing error of {$<$}2\% in the volume of the daughter droplets for a number of fluids such as deionized water, DNA solutions and DNA--protein mixtures. Customized droplet splitting ratios of up to 20\,:\,80 are achieved by positioning the blade at the appropriate position. Additionally, by fabricating multiple 3D microblades on one electrode, two to five uniform daughter droplets can be generated simultaneously. Finally, by taking synthetic DNA targets and their corresponding molecular beacon probes as a model system, multiple potential pathogens that cause sepsis are detected rapidly on the 3D-blade-equipped DMF chip, rendering it as a promising tool for parallel diagnosis of diseases.},

Microfluidic devices can experience heating inside their channels during operation due to underlying physicochemical phenomena occurring therein. Such heating, whether required or not, must be monitored to ensure adequate device operation. Therefore, different techniques have been developed to measure and control temperature in microfluidic devices. In this contribution, the operating principles and applications of these techniques are reviewed. Temperature-monitoring instruments revised herein include thermocouples, thermistors, and custom-built temperature sensors. Of these, thermocouples exhibit the widest operating range; thermistors feature the highest accuracy; and custom-built temperature sensors demonstrate the best transduction. On the other hand, temperature control methods can be classified as external- or integrated-methods. Within the external methods, microheaters are shown to be the most adequate when working with biological samples, whereas Peltier elements are most useful in applications that require the development of temperature gradients. In contrast, integrated methods are based on chemical and physical properties, structural arrangements, which are characterized by their low fabrication cost and a wide range of applications. The potential integration of these platforms with the Internet of Things technology is discussed as a potential new trend in the field.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidics (DMF) is an emerging technique for manipulating small volumes of liquids. DMF is particularly well suited for analytical applications as it allows automated handling of discrete samples, and it has been integrated with several inline analysis techniques. However, examples of the integration of DMF with electroanalytical methods are notably scarce, and those that have been reported rely on external electrodes that impose limitations on complexity. To combine the full capabilities of DMF with voltammetry, we designed a platform featuring a three-electrode electrochemical cell integrated in a microfabricated DMF device, removing the need for external electrodes and allowing for complete droplet control. The performance of the DMF/voltammetry system is comparable to that of a commercial screen printed electrode, and the new platform was applied to generating a calibration series for acetaminophen with a limit of detection of 76 {$\mu$}M and good precision (4\% average RSD), all with minimal human intervention. We propose that this platform and variations thereof may be a useful new tool for microscale electroanalysis and will be a complementary system to existing inline analysis techniques for DMF.},

  abstract = {Liquid droplets bridging the gap between two dielectric-coated horizontal electrode plates suffer breakup instabilities when a voltage applied between the electrodes exceeds a threshold. Interestingly enough, broken liquid bridges (i.e. a pair of a sessile and a pendant drop) can spontaneously rejoin if the voltage is still applied to the electrodes. Here we study the electro-hydrostatics of the liquid bridges in the joined or broken state and we illuminate the mechanisms of the shape transitions that lead to bridge rupture or droplet joining. The governing equations of the capillary electro-hydrostatics form nonlinear and free boundary problems which are solved numerically by the Galerkin/finite element method. On one hand, we found that capillary bridges become unstable at a turning point bifurcation in their solution space. The solutions past the turning point are unstable and the instability signals the bridge rupture. On the other hand, the separate droplets approach each other as the applied voltage increases. However, solutions become unstable past a critical voltage at a turning point bifurcation and the droplets join. By studying the relative position of the turning points corresponding to bridge rupture and droplet joining, respectively, we define parameter regions where stable bridges or separate droplets or oscillations between them can be realized.},

  abstract = {Salmonella is a pathogenic bacterium capable of causing serious food-borne illness, which has caused worldwide concern. It can enter the food supply chain at various stages of production, distribution, and marketing. Due to its high prevalence, it is necessary to develop effective and efficient methods for the identification, detection, and monitoring of Salmonella at an early stage. While traditional detection technologies often have long detection times, complex operation and low sensitivity, emerging biosensor technologies combine novel nanomaterials with signal amplification methods to achieve improved performance. Biosensors show several advantages over traditional assays in terms of specificity, accuracy, and sensitivity and show superiority in rapid response. They are now seen as promising alternative tools since they are accessible and applicable approaches for rapid detection. In recent years, there has been a boom in the development of biosensors for the detection of foodborne Salmonella. This paper focuses on the comparison of new methods for the detection of optical and electrochemical biosensors in recent years, analyzes the different separation strategies and determination methods used, and provides an outlook on the future development of biosensors for the detection of Salmonella.},

The device employed a conductivity cell with copper electrodes, connected in series with a resistor, powered using an oscillating power source. Griess reaction-based photometric detection using an LED and photodiode was used to quantify nitrite. A transimpedance amplifier circuit was designed and fabricated to amplify the photodiode output. pH detection was achieved using a commercially available pH probe and an Arduino pH breakout board. A low-cost 3D printed syringe pump was developed to achieve flow control. Atmega 328P (onboard Arduino Uno) was used to integrate the subsystems.

For many of them, however, it often remains unclear whether the (automatically) generated design indeed works as intended and/or satisfies its purpose. Simulations, e.g., based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can help here as they allow for studying the behavior of microfluidic devices without the need for actual fabrication. However, the setup and configuration of CFD simulations is timeconsuming and requires extensive expertise---some of the reasons why it is hardly utilized in the design automation community yet. In this work, we propose a workflow that improves upon this state of the art by automating intermediate steps and highlighting the parameters that are relevant to the specific use case. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed workflow for fluid mixing in channel-based microfluidics.},

However, a conventional DMFB is limited by: (i) the number of electrical connections that can be practically realized, (ii) constraints on droplet size and volume, and (iii) the need for special fabrication processes and the associated reliability/yield concerns. To overcome the above challenges, DMFBs based on a micro-electrode-dot-array (MEDA) architecture have been proposed and fabricated recently. Error recovery is of key interest for MEDA biochips due to the need for system reliability. Errors are likely to occur during droplet manipulation due to defects, chip degradation, and the uncertainty inherent in biochemical experiments. In this paper, we first formalize error-recovery objectives, and then synthesize optimal error-recovery protocols using a model based on Stochastic Multiplayer Games (SMGs). We also present a global error-recovery technique that can update the schedule of fluidic operations in an adaptive manner. Using three representative real-life bioassays, we show that the proposed approach can effectively reduce the bioassay completion time and increase the probability of success for error recovery.},

This review offers a guide, with examples, to making robust droplet flow devices.           ,              Since the first reports two decades ago, droplet-based systems have emerged as a compelling tool for microbiological and (bio)chemical science, with droplet flow providing multiple advantages over standard single-phase microfluidics such as removal of Taylor dispersion, enhanced mixing, isolation of droplet contents from surfaces, and the ability to contain and address individual cells or biomolecules. Typically, a droplet microfluidic device is designed to produce droplets with well-defined sizes and compositions that flow through the device without interacting with channel walls. Successful droplet flow is fundamentally dependent on the microfluidic device -- not only its geometry but moreover how the channel surfaces interact with the fluids. Here we summarise the materials and fabrication techniques required to make microfluidic devices that deliver controlled uniform droplet flow, looking not just at physical fabrication methods, but moreover how to select and modify surfaces to yield the required surface/fluid interactions. We describe the various materials, surface modification techniques, and channel geometry approaches that can be used, and give examples of the decision process when determining which material or method to use by describing the design process for five different devices with applications ranging from field-deployable chemical analysers to water-in-water droplet creation. Finally we consider how droplet microfluidic device fabrication is changing and will change in the future, and what challenges remain to be addressed in the field.},

  abstract = {A high degree of beam steering is demonstrated using an electrowetting-driven liquid prism. While prism devices have typically relied on complex and expensive laboratory setups, such as high-vacuum facilities for fabrication of dielectric layers, this work utilizes a simple dip-coating method to provide an ion gel layer as a dielectric, offering 2 or 3 orders higher specific capacitance (c {$\approx$} 10\,{$\mu$}F/cm2) than that of conventional dielectrics. Analytical studies present the effects of liquid selection and arrangement on overall prism performance. For experimental demonstrations of high-performance beam steering, we not only selected two immiscible liquids of water and 1-bromonaphthalene (1-BN) oil which provide the large refractive index difference (nwater\,=\,1.33 and n1-BN\,=\,1.65 at {$\lambda$}\,=\,532\,nm) between them, but also utilized a double-stacked prism configuration which increases the number of interfaces for incoming light to be steered. At a prism apex angle of {$\varphi$}\,=\,27{$^\circ$}, we were able to achieve significantly large beam steering of up to {$\beta$}\,=\,19.06{$^\circ$}, which is the highest beam steering performance ever demonstrated using electrowetting technology.},

Along with this has been a major push towards portability and therefore a decreased reliance on external infrastructure (such as detection sensors, heaters or voltage sources).'' In this review we provide an in-depth look at the ``state-of-the-art'' in integrated microfludic devices for a broad range of application areas from on-chip DNA analysis, immunoassays and cytometry to advances in integrated detection technologies for and miniaturized fuel processing devices.

The advent of digital microfluidic lab-on-a-chip (LoC) technology offers such a detection system due to the advantages in portability, reduction of the volumes of the sample and reagents, faster analysis times, increased automation, low power consumption, compatibility with mass manufacturing, and high throughput. We describe progress towards integrating sample collection onto a digital microfluidic LoC that is a component of a cascade impactor device. The sample collection is performed by impacting airborne particles directly onto the surface ofthe chip. After the collection phase, the surface ofthe chip is washed with a micro-droplet of solvent. The droplet will be digitally directed across the impaction surface, dissolving sample constituents. Because ofthe very small droplet volume used for extraction ofthe sample from a wide collection area, the resulting solution is relatively concentrated and the analytes can be detected after a very short sampling time (1 mm) due to such pre-concentration. After the washing phase, the droplet is mixed with specific reagents that produce colored reaction products. The concentration of the analyte is quantitatively determined by measuring absorption at target wavelengths using a simple light emitting diode and photodiode setup. Specific applications include automatic measurements of major inorganic ions in aerosols, such as sulfate, nitrate and ammonium, with a time resolution of 1 mm and a detection limit of 30 ng/m3. We have already demonstrated the detection and quantification of nitroaromatic explosives without integrating the sample collection. Other applications being developed include airborne bioagent detection.},

There is a pressing need to deliver a top-down design methodology that the biochip designer can leverage the same level of computer-aided design support as the semi-conductor industry now does. Moreover, as microelectronics fabrication technology is scaling up and integrated device performance is improving, it is expected that these microfluidic biochips will be integrated with microelectronic components in nextgeneration system-on-chip designs.

The proposed architecture allows dynamic configurations and activations of identical basic microfluidic unit called `micro-electrode cells' to design microfluidic components, layouts, routing, microfluidic operations and applications of the biochip hierarchically. Fundamental microfluidic operations have been successfully performed by the architecture. In addition, this novel architecture demonstrates a number of advantages and flexibilities over the conventional digital microfluidics in performing advanced microfluidic operations.},

Inspired by the drop-counting principle implemented in a clinical gravity drip, we propose a novel microfluidic flowmetry technology for polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based conventional microfluidic devices, known as a microfluidic digital meter-on-chip (DMC), to achieve on-chip and localized microflow measurements with ultrahigh precision and a wide tunable range. The DMC technology primarily relies on capillarity, unlike a gravity drip, to induce a characteristic interfacial droplet pinch-off process, from which digital microflowmetry devices can discretize continuous flow into countable transferred liquid units with consistent quantifiable volumes. Enabled by the passive discretization principle and optical transparency, the DMC device requires no external energy input or bulky control equipment, and a non-contact wireless optical detection scheme using a smartphone can be conveniently used as a readout module. Moreover, the DMC technology achieves an ultrahigh flow-to-frequency sensitivity (6.59 Hz ({$\mu$}L min               -1               )               -1               ) and resolution (droplet transfer volume down to 2.5 nL, nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than in previously reported work, resulting in ultralow flow rates of 1 {$\mu$}L min               -1               ). In addition, the flow rate measurement range covers up to 80 {$\mu$}L min               -1               and down to at least 150 nL min               -1               (over 100 times lower than reported similar digital flowmetry on the same time scale) using the current device configuration. Benefiting from its simple device architecture and adaptability, the versatile DMC technology can be seamlessly integrated with various microfluidic and nanofluidic devices for drug delivery and biochemical analysis, serving as a promising technology platform for next-generation highly demanding microflow measurements.},

This demonstration proves the concept that electrochemical sensors can be seamlessly integrated with sample preparation units in a digital microfluidic platform. More significantly, the successful on-chip fabrication of a sensor array indicates that sensors become reconfigurable and have longer lifetime in a digital microfluidic platform. The on-chip fabrication of ion-selective electrodes includes electroplating Ag followed by forming AgCl layer by chemical oxidation and depositing a thin layer of desired polymer-based ion selective membrane on one of the sensor electrodes. In this study, potassium ionophores work as potassium ion channels and make the membrane selective to potassium ions. This selectiveness results in the voltage difference across the membrane layer, which is correlated with potassium ion concentration. The calibration curve of the fabricated potassium-selective electrode demonstrates the slope of 58 mV/dec for potassium concentration in KCl sample solutions and shows good agreement with the ideal Nernstian response. The proposed sensor platform is an outstanding candidate for a portable home-use for continuous monitoring of ions thanks to its advantages such as easy automation of sample preparation and detection processes, elongated sensor lifetime, minimal membrane and sample consumption, and user-definable/ reconfigurable sensor array.},

Additional components (such as heaters, centrifuges, mixers, etc.) are required in practical applications on DMF devices. In this paper, a DMF chip interconnection method based on electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) was proposed. An open modified slippery liquid-infused porous surface (SLIPS) membrane was used as the dielectric-hydrophobic layer material, which consisted of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane and silicone oil. Indium tin oxide (ITO) glass was used to manufacture the DMF chip. In order to test the relationship between the splicing gap and droplet moving, the effect of the different electrodes on/off time on the minimum driving voltage when the droplet crossed a splicing gap was investigated. Then, the effects of splicing gaps of different widths, splicing heights, and electrode misalignments were investigated, respectively. The experimental results showed that a driving voltage of 119 V was required for a droplet to cross a splicing gap width of 300 {\textmu}m when the droplet volume was 10 {\textmu}L and the electrode on/off time was 600 ms. At the same time, the droplet could climb a height difference of 150 {\textmu}m with 145 V, and 141 V was required when the electrode misalignment was 1000 {\textmu}m. Finally, the minimum voltage was not obviously changed, when the same volume droplet with different aqueous solutions crossed the splicing gap, and the droplet could cross different chip types. These splicing solutions show high potential for simultaneous detection of multiple components in human body fluids.},

We illustrate its use with the computation of static shapes of charged drops over a flat surface and under the influence of an external potential. For the study of dynamic problems, where drops can move over a solid substrate we develop a phase-field model. Such models replace the sharp interfaces between two fluids by a so-called diffuse interface.

Prevention of outbreaks caused by pathogens such as               Legionella pneumophila               would be facilitated by the development of sensitive and specific bioanalytical assays that can be easily integrated in miniaturized fluidic handling systems. In this work, we report on the integration of an amplification-free assay in digital microfluidics (DMF) for the detection of               Legionella               bacteria based on targeting 16s rRNA. We first review the design of the developed DMF devices, which provide the capability to store up to one hundred nL-size droplets simultaneously, and discuss the challenges involved with on-chip integration of the RNA-based assay. By optimizing the various steps of the assay, including magnetic capture, hybridization duration, washing steps, and assay temperature, a limit of detection as low as 1.8 attomoles of synthetic 16s rRNA was obtained, which compares advantageously to other amplification-free detection systems. Finally, we demonstrate the specificity of the developed assay by performing multiplex detection of 16s rRNAs from a pathogenic and a non-pathogenic species of               Legionella               . We believe the developed DMF devices combined with the proposed detection system offers new prospects for the deployment of rapid and cost-effective technologies for on-site monitoring of pathogenic bacteria.},

All fluid operations are performed on nano-liter droplet independently handled solely by electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) actuation. A bottom-up architecture was used for chip design due to the development and validation of elementary fluidic designs, which are then assembled. This approach speeds up development and industrialization while minimizing the effort in designing and simplifying chip-fluidic programming. Dispensing reproducibility for 64 nl droplets obtained a CV below 3\% and mixing time was only a few seconds. Ease of the integration was demonstrated by performing on chip serial dilutions of 2.8-folds, four times. The second part of this paper concerns the development of new innovative fluidic functions in order to extend EWOD-actuated digital fluidics' capabilities. Experiments of particle dispensing by EWOD droplet handling are reported. Finally, work is shown concerning the coupling of EWOD actuation and magnetic fields for magnetic bead manipulation.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidics, a technique for manipulation of droplets, is becoming increasingly important for the development of miniaturized platforms for laboratory processes. Despite the enthusiasm, droplet motion is frequently hindered by the desorption of proteins or other analytes to surfaces. Current approaches to minimize this unwanted surface fouling involve the addition of extra species to the droplet or its surroundings, which might be problematic depending on the droplet content. Here, a new strategy is introduced to move droplets containing cells and other analytes on solid substrates, without extra moieties; in particular, droplets with bovine serum albumin could be moved at a concentration 2000 times higher than previously reported (without additives). This capability is achieved by using a soot-based superamphiphobic surface combined with a new device geometry, which favors droplet rolling. Contrasting with electrowetting, wetting forces are not required for droplet motion.},

  abstract = {A direct, sensitive, near-real-time, handheld optical immunoassay device was developed to detect Salmonella typhimurium in the naturally occurring liquid from fresh poultry packages (hereafter ``chicken matrix''), with just single pipetting of sample (i.e., no filtration, culturing and/or isolation, thus reducing the assay time and the error associated with them). Carboxylated, polystyrene microparticles were covalently conjugated with anti-Salmonella, and the immunoagglutination due to the presence of Salmonella was detected by reading the Mie scatter signals from the microfluidic channels using a handheld device. The presence of chicken matrix did not affect the light scatter signal, since the optical parameters (particle size d, wavelength of incident light l and scatter angle y) were optimized to minimize the effect of sample matrix (animal tissues and blood proteins, etc.). The sample was loaded into a microfluidic chip that was split into two channels, one pre-loaded with vacuumdried, antibody-conjugated particles and the other with vacuum-dried, bovine serum albuminconjugated particles. This eliminated the need for a separate negative control, effectively minimizing chip-to-chip and sample-to-sample variations. Particles and the sample were diffused in-channel through chemical agitation by Tween 80, also vacuum-dried within the microchannels. Sequential mixing of the sample to the reagents under a strict laminar flow condition synergistically improved the reproducibility and linearity of the assay. In addition, dried particles were shown to successfully detect lower Salmonella concentrations for up to 8 weeks. The handheld device contains simplified circuitry eliminating unnecessary adjustment stages, providing a stable signal, thus maximizing sensitivity. Total assay time was 10 min, and the detection limit 10 CFU mL{\`A}1 was observed in all matrices, demonstrating the suitability of this device for field assays.},

  abstract = {This work develops a technology for actuating droplets of any size without the requirement for high voltages or active control systems, which are typically found in competitive systems. The droplet actuation relies on two microelectrodes separated by a variable gap distance to generate an electrostatic gradient. The physical mechanism for the droplet motion is a combination of liquid dielectrophoresis and electrowetting. Investigating the system behavior as a function of the driving frequency identified the relative contribution of these two mechanisms and the optimum operating conditions. A fixed signal frequency of 0.5 kHz actuated various liquids and contaminants. Droplet actuation was demonstrated on several platforms, including linear, radial-symmetric, and bilateral-symmetric droplet motion. The electrode designs are scalable and can be fabricated on a flexible and optically transparent substrate: these key advancements will enable consumer applications that were previously inaccessible. A self-cleaning platform was also tested under laboratory conditions and on the road. This technology has significant potential in microfluidics and self-cleaning platforms, for example, in the automotive sector to clean body parts, camera covers, and sensors.},

Following a reaction time of 4 min, the microchip is removed from the hotplate and placed in the microscope stage of a laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection system. The formaldehyde concentration of the sample is then inversely derived from the measured value of the fluorescence intensity. The validity of the proposed device is confirmed by comparing the detection results obtained for standard samples with known formaldehyde concentrations ranging from 1 to 50 ppm with those obtained using a traditional UV/VIS absorption spectrometry. The real-world applicability of the proposed device is then demonstrated by measuring the formaldehyde concentration in ten commercial Chinese herbs. It is shown that the measurement results deviate by no more than 3.7\% from those results obtained using colorimetric method by CAAPIC. Overall, the results presented in this study show that the proposed microchip provides a rapid and reliable tool for formaldehyde concentration measurement purposes.},

  abstract = {Rapid detection of food-borne pathogens is essential to public health and the food industry. Although the conventional culture method is highly sensitive, it takes at least a few days to detect food-borne pathogens. Even though polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can detect food-borne pathogens in a few hours, it is more expensive and unsatisfactorily sensitive relative to the culture method. We have developed a method to rapidly detect Salmonella enterica by using a compact disc (CD)-shaped device that can reduce reagent consumption in conventional PCR. The detection method, which combines culture and PCR, is more rapid than the conventional culture method and is more sensitive and cheaper than PCR. In this study, we also examined a sample preparation method that involved collecting bacterial cells from food. The bacteria collected from chicken meat spiked with S. enterica were mixed with PCR reagents, and PCR was performed on the device. At a low concentration of S. enterica, the collected S. enterica was cultured before PCR for sensitive detection. After cultivation for 4 h, S. enterica at 1.7 {\textasciicircum} 104 colony-forming units (CFUs){\textasciidieresis} g{\textasciiacute}1 was detected within 8 h, which included the time needed for sample preparation and detection. Furthermore, the detection of 30 CFUs{\textasciidieresis} g{\textasciiacute}1 of S. enterica was possible within 12 h including 8 h for cultivation.},

  abstract = {Biosensors are powerful analytical devices that detect and quantify target analytes in a sample. Due to their high selectivity and sensitivity, enzymes, proteins, antibodies, peptides, and whole cells are commonly used as sensing elements in biosensors. However, the design and optimization of biosensors can be challenging due to the complexity of these biomolecules and their interactions with target analytes. In recent years, computational methods have emerged as powerful tools for designing and optimizing biosensors, enabling researchers to predict the behavior of biomolecules and their interactions with target analytes. Computational fluid mechanics can aid in the design of microfluidic systems for biosensing applications. In contrast, molecular dynamic simulation, molecular docking, quantum mechanics, and virtual screening methods can be used to predict the behavior of biomolecules at the atomic level and study the binding kinetics and thermodynamics of interactions. This paper critically discusses the use of computational methods in biosensors, focusing on enzyme-based, protein-based, antibody-based, peptide-based, and whole-cell-based biosensors. We also review using computational fluid mechanics, molecular dynamic simulation, molecular docking, quantum mechanics, and virtual screening methods in biosensor design and optimization. Additionally, we discuss the applications of these computational methods and biosensors in healthcare, environmental monitoring, food safety, biodefense, and security. Combining computational biosensors and computational methods offers tremendous potential for developing advanced biosensors with enhanced sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. However, challenges remain, such as the need for more accurate models and the integration of experimental and computational approaches. We conclude by discussing the prospects and challenges of computational biosensors and methods, highlighting the need for further research to drive innovation and improve human health and well-being.},

The device consisted of two differentiated parts: a poly (dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microfluidic structure obtained by soft lithography and a fully integrated chemical sensing platform including four working microelectrodes, two reference microelectrodes and one counter microelectrode for detecting ammonium in a continuous mode. The performance of the device was evaluated following its potentiometric response when analyzing ammonium containing samples. As a key parameter, its time of response was compared to that of a commercially available electrical conductivity sensor used as reference sensor during tests in laboratory using flowing tap water and technical scale using flowing wastewater. As a result, the LOC showed a slope of 55 mV/decade, a limit of detection of 4{$\cdot$}10-5 M and a time of full response between 10 and 12 s. It was demonstrated that the device can provide fast and reliable data at real time when immersed in a laminar flow of water. Moreover, the test of robustness showed that it was still functional after immersion in sewage for at least 15 min. Besides, the LOC reported here can be helpful for a wide variety of flowing-water applications such as aqua culture outlets control, in-situ and continuous analysis of rivers effluents and sea waters monitoring among others.},

Conventional detection methods like the plate counting and molecular diagnosis strategies are still not suitable for timely and rapid on-site detection due to the cumbersome operations, requirement of trained operators and sophisticated instruments. Microfluidics provide a powerful tool for pathogen detection due to the intrinsic advantages including easy integration, miniaturization, portability, and small sample consumption. Up to now, many research works have reported the combination of microfluidics with various detection techniques and signal amplification technologies to achieve the rapid and sensitive detection of foodborne pathogens. In this review, we mainly summarized the significant developed microfluidic based devices for pathogenic bacteria detection over the past five years, including (1) integration of sample preparation techniques like cell capture and enrichment, and nucleic acid related sample preparation methods on chip; (2) various detection methods, such as colorimetric, fluorescence, chemiluminescence, and mass spectrometry; (3) microfluidic paper-based analytical devices, particularly for the applications in resource-limited settings, remote areas or on-site detection. The limitations and advantages of these methods were summarized and discussed in order to comprehensively understand the latest microfluidic-based detection techniques for foodborne pathogens. Finally, the future challenges and directions for pathogens detection based on microfluidic based biosensors were also discussed and summarized.},

Detailed mathematical discussion shows that threshold force for mobilization is a function of droplet size and liquid parameters, and droplet velocity after depinning is a function of applied thermal gradient, droplet size and liquid parameters. The device with Ti as micro-heater, Au film as pad, Cr/Au as controlling electrode arrays, high quality SiO2 film as dielectric layer on glass substrate is fabricated by silicon bulk process and employs fluorocarbon polymer as hydrophobic layer to functionalize the surface to be hydrophobic so as to facilitate droplet transportation. Test results show that transportation velocity of 3 {\textmu}l DI water and silicone oil can reach 0.1 mm/s and 1 mm/s respectively at a voltage of 7 V. Driving voltage, transportation velocity of droplets and effect of contact angle hysteresis are discussed and the results are in agreement with theoretical results. The results provide some practical guidelines for the design of microfluidic chips based on thermocapillary actuation. In this study, we demonstrated that thermocapillary actuation of droplets is tunable and the chip can find great application in lab-on-a-chip due to its simple structure and low-cost fabrication process.},

EWOD is effective to manipulate (create, transport, split, and merge) conductive droplets being currently used for many biological, chemical, and optical applications. DEW can also manipulate droplets but more efficiently with dielectric (nonconductive) fluids. A digital microfluidic platform efficiently operable by both EWOD and DEW would offer higher versatility in handling a wide range of fluids, regardless of their conductivities. In this regard, this article presents a new hybrid electrode design enabling EWOD and DEW to drive various kinds of droplet fluids on a single platform. In addition, a slippery liquid-infused surface (SLIPS) is integrated with the hybrid electrodes. The SLIPS is well known to resist biofouling and repel sticky fluids, which endows the hybrid electrodes with much wider application spectra. As a result, the present SLIPS-integrated hybrid electrodes facilitate actuating various kinds of fluids which would not be driven by conventional EWOD and/or DEW electrodes. This paper presents the successful transportation of not only conductive fluids including water, protein solution, glycerol, and honey but also nonconductive fluids including dodecane, silicone oil, and light and heavy crude oil, all driven by the SLIPS-integrated hybrid electrodes. The performance comparisons among solid, interdigitating, and hybrid electrodes are made by testing both conductive and nonconductive droplets.},

  abstract = {Rivers are important natural resources of a country as they provide a wide range of ecosystem services. However, the problem is that rivers in Malaysia are badly degraded due to mismanagement, neglect, pollution and abuse. River management in Malaysia is largely based on the government-centric top-down model which is sectoral-based. This model is ineffective as it has no private sector, NGO and public engagement and support. This paper aims to examine various types of river management models to identify the ones that can be effective in Malaysia. The methodology used a mixture of literature review of existing river management models, secondary data on published journal papers, reports and books on river management. Results of selected river management conferences are also studied, examined and findings synthesized. Primary data is also compiled with selected in-depth qualitative interviews with key government officers, managers of private companies, NGO officers and village heads. Results show that the government (various levels) is traditionally the responsible party in managing rivers, but increasingly, the public, NGOs, businesses and other stakeholders are actively involved. Results also show that holistic river management with active engagement of all stakeholders is necessary. In Malaysia, rivers are found to be intricately intertwined with all aspects of development. It was concluded that the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model is an effective river management model in Malaysia as it conserves the river and its environment, and brings together all parties for building their capacities in river management towards achieving many Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).},

Passive microfluidic devices are geometry-dependent, and their uses are rather limited. Active microfluidic devices in-clude sensors or detectors that transduce chemical, biological, and physical changes into electrical or optical signals. Also, they are transduction devices that detect biological and chemical changes in biomedical applications, and they are highly versatile microfluidic tools for disease diagnosis and organ modeling. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the significant advances that have been made in the development of microfluidics devices. We will discuss the function of mi-crofluidic devices as micromixers or as sorters of cells and substances (e.g., microfiltration, flow or displacement, and trapping). Microfluidic devices are fabricated using a range of techniques, includ-ing molding, etching, three-dimensional printing, and nanofabrication. Their broad utility lies in the detection of diagnostic biomarkers and organ-on-chip approaches that permit disease modeling in cancer, as well as uses in neurological, cardiovascular, hepatic, and pulmonary diseases. Biosensor applications allow for point-of-care testing, using assays based on enzymes, nanozymes, antibodies, or nucleic acids (DNA or RNA). An anticipated development in the field includes the optimization of techniques for the fabrication of microfluidic devices using biocompatible materials. These devel-opments will increase biomedical versatility, reduce diagnostic costs, and accelerate diagnosis time of microfluidics technology.},

When a chip undergoes a test in offline mode, then the entire biochip should be available for testing, whereas for the online mode test droplet might be stalled due to unavailability of the next cell in the routing path. However, in both the scenarios one or more droplets route across the chip and the arrival time is also recorded at the destination. So here we have proposed two test schemes to know the correctness of any biochip. Diagnosability is an important feature to find the exact position of the faulty electrode. Our proposed scheme reduces the overall testing and diagnosis time significantly. It also provides an alternative routing path in biochip for fault tolerance.},

Fortunately, advances in personal computing associated with free and open-source software production facilitate this work of prospecting and understanding complex scenarios. Thus, for the development of this work, the keywords ``biofuel'' and ``nanocatalyst'' were delivered to the Scopus database, which returned 1071 scientific articles. The titles and abstracts of these papers were saved in Research Information Systems (RIS) format and submitted to automatic analysis via the Visualization of Similarities Method implemented in VOSviewer 1.6.18 software. Then, the data extracted from the VOSviewer were processed by software written in Python, which allowed the use of the network data generated by the Visualization of Similarities Method. Thus, it was possible to establish the relationships for the pair between the nodes of all clusters classified by Link Strength Between Items or Terms (LSBI) or by year. Indeed, other associations should arouse particular interest in the readers. However, here, the option was for a numerical criterion. However, all data are freely available, and stakeholders can infer other specific connections directly. Therefore, this innovative approach allowed inferring that the most recent pairs of terms associate the need to produce biofuels from microorganisms' oils besides cerium oxide nanoparticles to improve the performance of fuel mixtures by reducing the emission of hydrocarbons (HC) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx).},

  abstract = {Microfluidics offer many advantages to Point of Care (POC) devices through lower reagent use and smaller size. Additionally, POC devices offer the unique potential to conduct tests outside of the laboratory. In particular, Electro-wetting on Dielectric (EWOD) microfluidics has been shown to be an effective way to move and mix liquids enabling many PoC devices. However, much of the research surrounding these microfluidic systems are focused on a single aspect of the system capability, such as droplet control or a specific new application at the device level using the EWOD technology. Often in these experiments the supporting systems required for operation are bench top equipment such as function generators, power supplies, and personal computers. Although various aspects of how an EWOD device is capable of moving and mixing droplets have been demonstrated at various levels, a complete self-contained and portable lab-on-a-chip system based on the EWOD technology has not been well demonstrated. For instance, EWOD systems tend to use high voltage alternating current (AC) signals to actuate electrodes, but little consideration is given to circuitry size or power consumption of such components to make the entire system portable. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of integrating all supporting hardware and software to correctly operate an EWOD device in a completely self-contained and battery-powered handheld unit. We present results that demonstrate a complete sample preparation flow for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction and isolation. The device was designed to be a field deployable, hand-held platform capable of performing many other sample preparation tasks automatically. Liquids are transported using EWOD and controlled via a programmable microprocessor. The programmable nature of the device allows it to be configured for a variety of tests for different applications. Many considerations were given towards power consumption, size, and system complexity which make it ideal for use in a mobile environment. The results presented in this paper show a promising step forward to the portable capability of microfluidic devices based on the EWOD technology.},

A digital microfluidic system typically consists of a planar array of cells with electrodes that control the droplets. The primary challenge in using droplet-based systems is that they require the simultaneous coordination of a potentially large number of droplets on the array as the droplets move, mix, and split. In this paper we describe a general-purpose system that uses simple algorithms and yet is versatile. First, we present a semi-automated approach to generate the array layout in terms of components. Next, we discuss simple algorithms to select destination components for the droplets and a decentralized scheme for components to route the droplets on the array. These are then combined into a reconfigurable system that has been simulated in software to perform analyses such as the DNA polymerase chain reaction. The algorithms have been able to successfully coordinate hundreds of droplets simultaneously and perform one or more chemical analyses in parallel. Because it is challenging to analytically characterize the behavior of such systems, simulation methods to detect potential system instability are proposed.},

  abstract = {The complexity of droplet microfluidics grows with the implementation of parallel processes and multiple functionalities on a single device. This poses a severe challenge to the engineer designing the corresponding microfluidic networks. In today's design processes, the engineer relies on calculations, assumptions, simplifications, as well as his/her experiences and intuitions. To validate the obtained specification of the microfluidic network, usually a prototype is fabricated and physical experiments are conducted thus far. In case the design does not implement the desired functionality, this prototyping iteration is repeated---obviously resulting in an expensive and time-consuming design process. To avoid unnecessary debugging loops involving fabrication and testing, simulation methods could help to initially validate the specification of the microfluidic network before any prototype is fabricated. However, state-of-the-art simulation tools come with severe limitations, which prevent their utilization for practically relevant applications. More precisely, they are often not dedicated to droplet microfluidics, cannot handle the required physical phenomena, are not publicly available, and can hardly be extended. In this work, we present an advanced simulation approach for droplet microfluidics that addresses these shortcomings and, eventually, allows simulating practically relevant applications. To this end, we propose a simulation framework at the one-dimensional analysis model, which directly works on the specification of the design, supports essential physical phenomena, is publicly available, and is easy to extend. Evaluations and case studies demonstrate the benefits of the proposed simulator: While current state-of-the-art tools were not applicable for practically relevant microfluidic networks, the proposed simulator allows reducing the design time and costs, e.g., of a drug screening device from one person month and USD 1200, respectively, to just a fraction of that.},

We present a base virtual topology and show how it can be leveraged to reduce algorithmic runtimes and guarantee rout ability.

A great deal of effort has been devoted to advancing this technology by means of enhancing droplet speed and stability. In this work, we numerically investigate the continuous droplet transport process in a parallel-plate EWOD DMF device with a previously proposed ``stripped electrode'' design and compare it with the transport motion of the conventional ``square electrode'' design. The microfluidic droplet motion is solved by a finite volume formulation on a fixed computational domain. The gas-liquid interface of a droplet is captured by a coupled level-set and volume-of-fluid scheme with the surface tension force at the interface computed by the continuum surface force method. A simplified viscous stress scheme reliant on the Hele-Shaw flow model is used to evaluate the viscous forces exerted by the parallel plates. The numerically simulated transport processes of the ``stripped electrode'' and ``square electrode'' designs show good agreement with the experimental results. Furthermore, a parametric study is conducted in which the influences of the strip number, activated contact angle, and gap spacing between the plates on droplet transport speed and stability are examined. It has been found that both the transport speed and stability can be noticeably improved by the ``stripped electrode'' design, which can be adopted for promoting the transport efficiency in a large number of droplet-based applications utilizing parallel-plate EWOD DMF systems.},

The microfluidic droplet motion is solved by a finite-volume scheme on a fixed computational domain. The numerical model is verified by an experimental study of microdrop production from an EWOD DMF device with three different electrode designs. After model verification, we examine the influences of the equilibrium contact angle and the spacing of the microchannel on stripped electrode based microdrop generation outcomes and discover five different regimes including the phenomena of satellite droplet formation and separation cessation. Despite the various generation outcomes, the daughter droplet size is found to vary linearly with a dimensionless EWOD parameter {$\kappa$}*. More importantly, for all successful generations, the deviation of the daughter droplet size from that of the stripped electrode is smaller than 3.5\%, which even reaches zero in proper conditions. This new configuration can be utilized as a convenient alternative for electrowetting-induced parallel microdrop production with excellent precision and controllability.},

Within this platform, the formation and merging of droplets inside an immiscible carrier fluid are two key procedures: (i) the emulsification step should lead to a very well controlled drop size (distribution); and (ii) the use of droplet as micro-reactors requires a reliable merging. A novel trend within this field is the use of additional active means of control besides the commonly used hydrodynamic manipulation. Electric fields are especially suitable for this, due to quantitative control over the amplitude and time dependence of the signals, and the flexibility in designing micro-electrode geometries. With this, the formation and merging of droplets can be achieved on-demand and with high precision. In this review on two-phase flow microfluidics, particular emphasis is given on these aspects.

  abstract = {In this paper, a palm-size digital microfluidic (DMF) platform integrated with colorimetric analysis was developed for quantifying the concentration of nitrite. To realize the on-chip repeatable colorimetric analysis, a novel printed circuit board (PCB)-based DMF chip was designed with an embedded aperture on the actuator electrode, forming a vertical light path for online measurement of the droplets. The capabilities of the DMF platform enable automatic manipulation of microliter-level droplets to implement Griess assay without the use of external systems such as syringe, pump, or valve, which provides the benefits including high flexibility, portability, miniature size, and low cost. Results indicated the characteristics of good linearity (R2 = 0.9974), the ignorable crosstalk for reusability, and the limit of detection (LOD) of nitrite as low as 5 {$\mu$}g/L. Furthermore, the presented platform was successfully applied to determine nitrite levels in food products with reliable results and satisfactory recoveries. This integrated DMF platform can be a promising new tool for a wide range of applications involving step-by-step solution mixing and optical detection in environmental monitoring, food safety analysis, and point-of-care testing.},

  abstract = {Electrohydrodynamic wetting manipulation plays a major role in modern microfluidic technologies such as lab-on-a-chip applications and digital microfluidics. Liquid dielectrophoresis (LDEP) is a common driving mechanism, which induces hydrodynamic motion in liquids by the application of nonhomogeneous electrical fields. Among strategies to analyze droplet movement, systematic research on the influence of different frequencies under AC voltage is missing. In this paper, we therefore present a first study covering the motion characteristics of LDEP-driven droplets of the dielectric liquids ethylene glycol and glycerol carbonate in the driving voltage frequency range from 50 Hz to 1600 Hz. A correlation between the switching speed of LDEP-actuated droplets in a planar electrode configuration and the frequency of the applied voltage is shown. Hereby, motion times of different-sized droplets could be reduced by up to a factor of 5.3. A possible excitation of the droplets within their range of eigenfrequencies is investigated using numerical calculations. The featured fluidic device is designed using larger-sized electrodes rather than typical finger or strip electrodes, which are commonly employed in LDEP devices. The influence of the electrode shape is considered simulatively by studying the electric field gradients.},

The FeMOF nanocubes decorated with PtNPs (Fe-MOF/PtNPs) were prepared as peroxidase mimics to catalyze hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to produce O2. The immune magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), the target bacteria, and the immune FeMOF/PtNPs were first mixed by the three-dimensional (3D) chaotic micromixer and conjugated in the microfluidic chip to form MNP-bacteria-Fe-MOF/PtNPs sandwich complexes. After magnetic separation and washing, H2O2 was injected and decomposed by Fe-MOF/PtNPs on the sandwich complexes to generate O2 in a sealed chamber. The increase in the pressure pushed the preloaded water to react with calcium oxide powder, resulting in the generation of heat, which was measured using the smartphone-based thermal sensor to determine the bacteria. The microfluidic immunosensor could detect Salmonella as low as 93 CFU/mL within 1 h.},

Applications range from prototyping to small-scale production, with 3D printing offering reduced logistics overheads, better design flexibility and ease of use compared with traditional fabrication methods. In addition, printer and material costs have also decreased rapidly. These advantages make 3D printing attractive for application in microfluidic chip fabrication. However, 3D printing microfluidics is still a new area. Is the technology mature enough to print complex microchannel geometries, such as droplet microfluidics? Can 3D-printed droplet microfluidic chips be used in biological or chemical applications? Is 3D printing mature enough to be used in every research lab? These are the questions we will seek answers to in our systematic review. We will analyze (1) the key performance metrics of 3D-printed droplet microfluidics and (2) existing biological or chemical application areas. In addition, we evaluate (3) the potential of large-scale application of 3D printing microfluidics. Finally, (4) we discuss how 3D printing and digital design automation could trivialize microfluidic chip fabrication in the long term. Based on our analysis, we can conclude that today, 3D printers could already be used in every research lab. Printing droplet microfluidics is also a possibility, albeit with some challenges discussed in this review.},

  abstract = {The heat transport capacity of traditional heat pipes is limited by the capillary pressure generated in the internal wick that pumps condensate to the evaporator. Recently, the authors conceptualized a novel heat pipe architecture, wherein wick-based pumping is replaced by electrowetting (EW)-based pumping of microliter droplets in the adiabatic section. An electrowetting heat pipe (EHP) can overcome the capillary limit to heat transport capacity and enable compact, planar, gravity-insensitive, and ultralow power consumption heat pipes that transport kiloWatt heat loads over extended distances. This work develops a novel technique for rapid, scalable fabrication of EW-based devices and studies critical microfluidic operations underlying the EHP, with the objective of predicting the key performance parameters of the EHP. Devices are fabricated on a printed circuit board (PCB) substrate with mechanically-milled electrodes, and a removable polyimide dielectric film. The first set of experiments uncovers the maximum channel gap (1\,mm) for reliable EW-based pumping; this parameter determines the heat transport capacity of the EHP, which scales linearly with the channel gap. The second set of experiments uncovers the maximum channel gap (375 microns) at which EW voltages can successfully split droplets. This is an important consideration which ensures EHP operability in the event of unintentional droplet merging. The third set of experiments demonstrate and study EW-induced droplet generation from an open-to-air reservoir, which mimics the interface between the condenser and adiabatic sections of the EHP. The experimental findings predict that planar, water-based EHPs with a (10\,cm by 4\,mm) cross section can transport 1.6 kW over extended distances ({$>$}1 m), with a thermal resistance of 0.01\,K W-1.},

Through designing the biosensor in such a way that it becomes a membrane with holes, we can apply a droplet on it and push or pull it through the membrane by means of a pressure difference. Contrary to traditional microfluidics for, e.g., flow cells where the analyte flows over the sensor, the flow is now directed through the sensor. We have implemented this scheme in silicon-on-insulator biosensors and have demonstrated in a first proof-of-principle experiment, an improvement in delivery time of at least a factor of three.},

  abstract = {Two-phase flow microfluidics is a promising platform for realizing Lab-on-a-Chip (LoC) devices, that perform different laboratory functions on a single chip. This is accomplished by processing droplets, containing biological/chemical samples, by different elements each performing specific operations. Usually, the sequence of elements in which droplets are processed is fixed, which limits the flexibility, effectiveness and reusability of such LoC devices. Recently, microfluidic networks for two-phase flow microfluidics have been introduced with the aim of realizing programmable and flexible LoC devices. In particular, the goal is to dynamically and passively assign the droplets' path through a microfluidic network, which enables to reuse the LoC devices for different laboratory functions. This paper presents the state-of-the-art and discusses various aspects of the practical realization. First, we provide a survey on microfluidic networking, including passive switching, network topologies and validation methods. Second, we propose a simple Droplet-on-Demand (DoD) system, which allows generating droplets at prescribed times and with prescribed volumes -- a crucial accomplishment in order to exploit the potential of microfluidic networks for practical purposes. We verify its functionality through experimental results. Third, we describe two promising applications for microfluidic networks, namely fast and flexible drug screening and screening of waterborne pathogens. Finally, we discuss future research opportunities and challenges.},

Here, a label-free lateral dielectrophoresis-based microfluidic sorting platform that can digitally quantify and separate microalgae into six outlets based on the degree of their intracellular lipid content is presented. In this microfluidic system, the degree of cellular lateral displacement is inversely proportional to the intracellular lipid level, which was successfully demonstrated using               Chlamydomonas reinhardtii               cells. Using this functionality, a quick digital quantification of sub-populations that contain different intracellular lipid level in a given population was achieved. In addition, the degree of lateral displacement of microalgae could be readily controlled by simply changing the applied DEP voltage, where the level of gating in the intracellular lipid-based sorting decision could be easily adjusted. This allowed for selecting only a very small percentage of a given population that showed the highest degree of intracellular lipid content. In addition, this approach was utilized through an iterative selection process on natural and chemically mutated microalgal populations, successfully resulting in enrichment of high-lipid-accumulating microalgae. In summary, the developed platform can be exploited to quickly quantify microalgae lipid distribution in a given population in real-time and label-free, as well as to enrich a cell population with high-lipid-producing cells, or to select high-lipid-accumulating microalgal variants from a microalgal library.},

The platform allows a ferrofluid droplet to be driven along a preprogrammed path. The platform consists of a programmable x-y-positioning stage, a permanent magnet and a glass plate coated with a thin layer of Teflon. First, the actuation of a stand-alone water-based ferrofluid droplet was investigated. Circular, rectangular, triangular and number-eight-shape trajectories were tested and analyzed. The speed of the droplet is evaluated from the position data of the black ferrofluid using a customized MATLAB program. The results show that better positioning accuracy and steady movement can be achieved with smooth trajectories. Next, the ferrofluid droplet as the driving engine for a cargo of other diamagnetic liquid droplets is demonstrated. The characteristics of different cargo volumes are investigated. Due to the liquid/liquid cohesion, a large cargo of five times the volume of a 3-{$\mu$}L ferrofluid droplet can be transported. If the cargo is larger than the driving ferrofluid droplet, the liquid system forms a long trail that faithfully follows the preprogrammed path. Various mixing experiments were carried out. The effectiveness of mixing in this system is demonstrated with a titration test as well as a chemiluminescence assay. The platform shows a robust, simple and flexible concept for implementing a complex analysis protocol with multiple reaction steps.},

  abstract = {Concentrating cells or adjusting the concentration of cells are one of the most fundamental steps in cell biology experiments, and are typically achieved through centrifugation. However this step is challenging to implement in droplet microfluidics. Here we present an in-droplet cell concentrator that operates by first gradually focusing cells inside a droplet to one side of the droplet using negative dielectrophoresis (nDEP), followed by asymmetric droplet splitting using a Y-shaped junction, resulting in two daughter droplets, one of which containing all or most of the cells. The developed platform was first characterized using droplets containing different number of polystyrene (PS) particles and by varying the applied voltages, flow rates, and the width ratios of the droplet splitting microchannels. Using this platform, the volume of one daughter droplet could be reduced up to 84\% compared to that of the mother droplet, which resulted in the PS particle concentration to increase by 5.6-fold, with an average recovery rate of 90\%. When testing with cells (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii), recovery rates as high as 98\% could be achieved while increasing the cell concentration by 5-fold. This technology adds a new capability to droplet microfluidics operation, and can be used for adjusting concentrations of cells in droplets, exchanging solutions in which cells are suspended in droplets (including cell washing steps), and separating cells of different dielectric properties inside droplets, all of which are common steps in conventional cell assays but have been so far difficult to achieve in droplet format.},

In order to prevent the spread of foodborne pathogens, detection methods are constantly being updated towards rapid, portable, inexpensive, and multiplexed on-site detection. Due to the nature of the small size and low volume, microfluidics has been applied to rapid, time-saving, sensitive, and portable devices to meet the requirements of on-site detection. Simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens is another key parameter to ensure food safety. Multiplexed detection technology, including microfluidic chip design, offers a new oppor\- tunity to achieve this goal.

In the sample preparation section, methods of cell capture and enrichment, as well as nucleic acid sample preparation, were described in detail, and in the section of detection methods, amplification, immunoassay, surface plasmon resonance and impedance spectroscopy were exhaustively illustrated. The limitations and advantages of all available experi\- mental options were also summarized and discussed in order to form a comprehensive understanding of cuttingedge technologies and provide a comparative assessment for future investigation and in-field application.},

  abstract = {Screening of foodborne pathogens is an effective way to prevent microbial food poisoning. A microfluidic biosensor was developed for rapid and sensitive detection of Salmonella Typhimurium using quantum dots (QDs) as fluorescent probes for sensor readout and manganese dioxide nanoflowers (MnO2 NFs) and as QDs nanocarriers for signal amplification. Prior to testing, amino-modified MnO2 nanoflowers (MnO2-NH2 NFs) were conjugated with carboxyl-modified QDs through EDC/NHSS method to form MnO2-QD NFs, and MnO2-QD NFs were functionalized with polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) to form MnO2-QD-pAb NFs. First, the mixture of target Salmonella Typhimurium cells and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) modified with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was injected with MnO2-QD-pAb NFs into a microfluidic chip to form MNP-bacteria-QD-MnO2 complexes. Then, glutathione (GSH) was injected to dissolve MnO2 on the complexes into Mn2+, resulting in the release of QDs. Finally, fluorescent intensity of the released QDs was measured using the fluorescent detector to determine the amount of Salmonella. A linear relationship between fluorescent intensity and bacterial concentration from 1.0 {\texttimes} 102 to 1.0 {\texttimes} 107 CFU/mL was found with a low detection limit of 43 CFU/mL and mean recovery of 99.7\% for Salmonella in spiked chicken meats, indicating the feasibility of this biosensor for practical applications.},

They are portable devices with built-in cameras and internal microprocessors which carry out image processing. In this case, the external computers are not needed and phones can provide fast and accurate results. Moreover, the connectivity of smartphones gives the possibility to share and provide real-time results when needed, whether in health diagnostics, environmental monitoring, immunoassays or food safety. Undoubtedly, the marriage of smartphones and microfluidics has a brilliant future in building low cost and easily operable systems for analysis in the field, realizing the idea of people's ``smartlife''. The aim of this review is to present and summarize the main advantages and disadvantages of the use of smartphones as well as to take a closer look at some novel achievements published during the last couple of years. In the next paragraphs, readers will find specific uses of a combination of smartphones and microfluidics such as water analysis, health analysis (virus and bacteria detection), and measurement of physical properties or smartphone liquid control in polymer devices.},

  abstract = {Foodborne contamination and associated illness in the United States is responsible for an estimated 48 million cases per year. Increased food demand, global commerce of perishable foods, and the growing threat of antibiotic resistance are driving factors elevating concern for food safety. Foodborne illness is often associated with fresh-cut, ready-to-eat produce commodities due to the perishable nature of the product and relatively minimal processing from farm to the consumer. The research presented here optimizes and evaluates the utility of microfluidic droplets, also termed ultra-miniaturized bioreactors, for rapid detection of viable Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium in a shredded lettuce wash water acquired from a major Mid-Atlantic produce processing facility (denoted as Producer) in the U.S. Using a fluorescently-labeled anti-S. Typhimurium antibody and relative fluorescence intensities, paired with in-droplet incubation, S. Typhimurium was detected and identified with 100\% specificity in less than 5 h. In initial optimization experiments using S. Typhimurium-spiked sterile water, the relative fluorescence intensity of S. Typhimurium was approximately two times that of the observed relative intensities of five non-S. Typhimurium negative controls at 4-h incubation in droplets containing Rappaport-Vasiliadis (RV) broth at 37{\r{}}C: relative fluorescence intensity for S. Typhimurium = 2.36 (95\% CI: 2.15--2.58), Enterobacter aerogens 1.12 (95\% CI: 1.09--1.16), Escherichia coli 700609 = 1.13 (95\% CI: 1.09--1.17), E. coli 13706 1.13 (95\% CI: 1.07--1.19), E. coli 700891 1.05 (95\% CI: 1.03--1.07) and Citrobacter freundii 1.04 (95\% CI: 1.03--1.05). S. Typhimurium- and E. aerogens-spiked shredded lettuce wash waters acquired from the Producer were then incubated 4 h in-droplet at 37{\r{}}C with RV broth. The observed relative fluorescence of S. Typhimurium was significantly higher than that of E. aerogens, 1.56 (95\% CI: 1.42--1.71) and 1.10 (95\% CI: 1.08--1.12), respectively. While further optimization focusing on compatible concentration methodologies for highly-dilute produce water samples is needed, this application of droplet microfluidics shows great promise in dramatically shortening the time necessary--from days to hours--to confirm viable bacterial contamination in ready-to-eat produce wash waters used throughout the domestic and international food industry.},

This paper explores efforts to leverage that most compelling aspect of DEP---an actuation force that depends on particle electrical properties---in the background of phenotypic variations in cell size. Several promising approaches, centering around the application of multiple electric fields with spatially mapped magnitude and/or frequencies, are expanding the capability of DEP cell separation.},

To understand the variability and to improve the biomedical requirement of a single cell, its analysis has become a key technique in biological and biomedical research. With a physical boundary of microchannels and microstructures, single cells are efficiently captured and analyzed, whereas electric forces sort and position single cells. Various microfluidic techniques have been exploited to manipulate single cells through hydrodynamic and electric forces. Digital microfluidics (DMF), the manipulation of individual droplets holding minute reagents and cells of interest by electric forces, has received more attention recently. Because of ease of fabrication, compactness and prospective automation, DMF has become a powerful approach for biological application. We review recent developments of various microfluidic chips for analysis of a single cell and for efficient genetic screening. In addition, perspectives to develop analysis of single cells based on DMF and emerging functionality with high throughput are discussed.},

The electrowetting phenomenon on modified SLIPS was investigated first, and it exhibited an up to 55{$^\circ$} contact angle difference with respect to voltage polarity while the threshold voltage was reduced to only 2 V. Then, a coplanar electrode experiment was designed to study the performance of droplet manipulation on several modified SLIPS samples with different vertically placed times and silicon oil viscosities. The optimal condition for preparing a modified SLIPS membrane is that a sample is placed vertically for 2 hours after infusing 10 cSt silicon oil, on which the droplet can be driven with the fastest velocity, and the activation voltage for moving a droplet is only 8 V. Finally, multi-droplet simultaneous and continuous manipulation on modified SLIPS in bi-direction on a loop of square electrodes was achieved. Interestingly, unlike asymmetric electrowetting, actuation methods on a solid insulator and hydrophobic layers, the droplet actuation velocity was not limited by the contact angle saturation effect and always increased with the applied voltage on modified SLIPS. This method achieves a very wide range of droplet continuous manipulation velocities from 0.075 mm s               -1               to 123 mm s               -1               under 20 V to 500 V applied voltage and the continuous droplet actuation voltage exhibits at least a 15-fold decrease compared to that of an unmodified SLIPS membrane.},

  abstract = {Microfluidics-based digital PCR (dPCR) is a potent technique capable of absolute quantification of nucleic acids with ultrahigh sensitivity. However, an indispensable process, nucleic acid extraction (NAE) remains hard to be integrated with dPCR into a monolithic device, because both of them involve complicated processes and exquisite fluid manipulation. An ideal solution to this issue is to integrate the two main microfluidic platforms, channel-based microfluidics (CMF) and digital microfluidics (DMF), which, however, remains very challenging. To address these challenges, we herein develop a photofabricated channel-digital microfluidic chip (pCDMF) with significant advantages including: the fabrication of pCDMF is very convenient due to the flexible material choices of photocuring, without tedious process of hydrophobic coating; a parallel-plate configuration can be easily formed, enabling all basic functions of DMF; various channels and microstructures can be freely designed, allowing for fluidic functions of CMF. It is therefore the first example of full integration of DMF and CMF as a monolithic device, with capabilities to precisely handle both discrete droplets and continuous fluids. Finally, an all-in-one device for sample-to-answer digital PCR has been successfully demonstrated. We also envisioned that the pCDMF may open an alternative route toward the fully integrated lab-on-a-chip for various biological applications.},

Typhimurium was first incubated with the anti-S. Typhimurium antibody conjugated RuBpy-doped fluorescent nanoparticles (AbS. Typhimurium-FNPs). After incubation, the reacted mixture of S. Typhimurium and AbS. TyphimuriumFNPs bioconjugates was directly introduced into the pDEP-based microfluidic system. On applying an AC voltage to the electrodes in a pDEP frequency region, the FNPs labeled S. Typhimurium cells moved to the electrodes and accumulated in the electrode gap, while the free AbS. Typhimurium-FNPs were flowed away. The enriched FNPs labeled S. Typhimurium were detected by fluorescence microscopy at the focused detection areas. This new method constructed a simultaneous on-line enrichment and detection platform, eliminated the separation and washing-out steps usually required for FNPs label involved bioassay. Utilizing signal amplification effects produced by pDEP on-line enrichment and FNPs label, the detection limit for S. Typhimurium in deionized water is 56 colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/mL). We applied the established approach to detecting artificially contaminated bottled mineral water samples; S. Typhimurium of 110 cfu/mL was accurately detected. It is believed that the proposed method will find wide applications in biomedicine fields demanding higher sensitive bacterial identification.},

Droplet generation is one key aspect in LOC devices which allows to conduct various chemical and biochemical assays enabling biological cell studies, high throughput drug development, and diagnostic screenings. This paper presents, modelling, simulation, and experimentation of an active droplet generator that is widely used in LOC devices. The model geometry used in this study was based on a flow focusing method of droplet generation. Droplet generation from the numerical simulations was observed within flow rate ratios ranging from 0.2 to 4 using optimised droplet contraction width of the generator model. Subsequently, a prototype droplet generator was designed and developed from Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) material using a layer-based fabrication method. Based on the experimental setup presented here, the calculated ratios of flow rates obtained for different voltage values have shown that the formation of droplets occur between flow rate ratios of 1.04 and 4.74. In ad\- dition, morphological parameters of the droplet images extracted from a digital image processing algorithm show that the mean diameter of the droplets decreases with decreasing flow rate ratios.},

  abstract = {Digital (droplet-based) microfluidic systems apply electromagnetic characteristics as the fundamental fluid actuation mechanism. These systems are often implemented in two-dimensional architectures, overcoming one-dimensional continuous flow channel practical issues. The fundamental operation for digital microfluidics requires the creation of an electric field distribution to achieve desired fluid actuation. The electric field distribution is typically non-uniform, enabling creation of net dielectrophoresis (DEP) force. The DEP force magnitude is proportional to the difference between microdroplet and surrounding medium complex dielectric constants, and the gradient of the electric field magnitude squared. Force sign/direction can be manipulated to achieve a force towards higher (positive DEP) or lower (negative DEP) electrostatic energy by tailoring the relative difference between microdroplet and surrounding medium complex dielectric constants through careful selection of the devices fabrication materials. The DEP force magnitudes and directions are applied here for well-controlled and high-speed microdroplet actuation. Control and speed characteristics arise from significant differences in the microdroplet/medium conductivity and the use of a micropin architecture with strong electric field gradients. The implementation, referred to here as a DEP microjet, establishes especially strong axial propulsion forces. Single- and double-micropin topologies achieve strong axial propulsion force, but only the double-micropin topology creates transverse converging forces for stable and controlled microdroplet actuation. Electric field distributions for each topology are investigated and linked to axial and transverse forces. Experimental results are presented for both topologies. The double-micropin topology is tested with biological fluids. Microdroplet actuation speeds up to 25 cm/s are achieved---comparable to the fastest speeds to-date.},

Several different electrode patterns were tested under the same conditions. The results indicate that condensation on a cooled flat surface was increased using electrowetting (EW) by accelerating the slow coalescence process where smaller droplets join to form larger droplets and leave behind a dry surface for new droplets to form. A pattern consisting of 100-lm wide interdigitated electrodes separated by 100-lm gaps showed the fastest growth in droplet size. The largest droplets formed with such a pattern had approximately 30 times larger volume than the largest droplets formed on the surface when electrowetting was not applied. Finer patterns exhibited a larger overall condensation rate, where the electrowetting method showed up to a 56\% increase in overall water condensation.},

However, poor water quality threatens the health of both humans and ecosystems. The aim of this review was to examine the available literature to investigate how health outcomes in Malaysia have been studied and reported as directly attributable to human infections from river water. Computer-aided searches from 10 electronic databases were undertaken, with searches limited to the English language and publication dates since January 2010. The literature search revealed that the predominant river water infections identified in Malaysia were bacterial (coliforms, Salmonella spp., typhoid, leptospirosis, melioidosis), viral (including dengue, hepatitis, enterovirus), parasitic infections including amoebiasis, giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis, helminth infections, Blastocystis infections and sarcocystosis. No studies were found that have attempted to evaluate the impact of water related infection on human health longitudinally. Moreover, the possibility of integrated water governance systems that could reduce infection and improve water quality, particularly for marginalized groups have not been discussed or studied. Several cross-sectional studies identified infections at a point in time, but large longitudinal data sets of water infection parameters and how they influence human health outcomes have not been reported. Using Malaysia as a demonstration case study, we suggest a number of recommendations based on using a systems approach to tackle the challenges involved in data collection and integration, which is central to the understanding, strategic planning and management of water-borne infections.},

The time-averaged effective electrical wetting tension, which is a function of AC frequency, is computed by integrating the Maxwell stress. The computed wetting tension is compared with the experimental result converted from the separately obtained contact-angle data. There is a good agreement between the two results at a low-frequency range and a qualitative agreement at a high-frequency range. Interestingly, the numerical results show that the electric-field strength decreases remarkably in the insulating layer near the TCL as the AC frequency increases. This decrease may account for the delay of the dielectric breakdown of an insulating layer in the AC case, which could be related to the contact-angle saturation phenomenon.},

As one of the frontend operations on digital microfluidic biochips, sample preparation plays an important role in biochemical assays and applications. For fast and high-throughput biochemical applications, it is critical to develop an automated design methodology for sample preparation. Prior work in this area does not provide solutions to the problem of design automation for sample preparation. Moreover, it is critical to ensure the correctness of droplets and recover from errors efficiently during sample preparation. Published work on error recovery is inefficient and impractical for sample preparation. Therefore, in this paper, we present an automated design methodology for sample preparation, including architectural synthesis, layout synthesis, and dynamic error recovery. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on real-life biochemical applications to demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency. Compared to prior work, the proposed algorithm can achieve up to 48.39\% reduction in sample preparation time.},

This paper proposes a dilution/mixing method with high utilization of intermediate droplets for preparing biochemical samples of multiple target concentrations on DMFBs. It provides the first solution to the problem of generating samples of multiple target concentrations. Unlike prior work in which the preparation of droplets of multiple target concentrations has to be carried out sequentially, this proposed approach takes a global view and all the target concentrations are processed concurrently. In addition, this is also the first approach that minimizes the number of waste droplets by utilizing intermediate droplets. Finally, the number of mixing steps can be reduced, leading to reduced completion time for sample preparation. The number of waste droplets is minimized by reducing the number of intermediate concentrations produced during sample preparation. Usable intermediate droplets are subsequently utilized to further reduce wastage. Simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve up to 71\% reduction in the number of waste droplets and up to 50\% reduction in sample preparation time.},

According to the recent market report, the growth of biochips market is twice than before. However, as the enormous business opportunities grow, piracy attacks, which are exploited by unscrupulous people to gain illegal profits, become a severe threat to DMFBs. To prevent piracy attacks, the conventional approach uses secret keys to perform authentication. Nevertheless, DMFBs only consist of electrodes to control the operations of droplets, and there are no memories and logic gates integrated on it to store secret keys. This makes designing secure defenses of DMFBs against piracy attacks more difficult. Thus, in this paper, we propose the first authentication method for piracy prevention of DMFBs based on a novel Physical Unclonable Function (PUF). The proposed PUF utilizes the inherent variation of electrodes on DMFBs to generate secret keys, so it does not require memory. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed PUF. Finally, we analyze the security of the proposed method against piracy attacks.},

First, we performed on- and off-chip comparison experiments for the magnetic bead nucleic acid extraction module and LAMP amplification function. The extraction efficiency for the on-chip test was comparable to that of conventional off-chip methods. The processing time for the automatic on-chip workflow was only 23 min, which was less than that of the conventional methods of 28 min 45 s. Meanwhile, the number of samples used in on-chip experiments was significantly smaller than that used in off-chip experiments; only 5 {\textmu}L of E. coli samples was required for nucleic acid extraction, and 1 {\textmu}L of the nucleic acid template was needed for the amplification reaction. In addition, we selected SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid reference materials for the nucleic acid detection experiment, demonstrating a limit of detection of 10 copies/{\textmu}L. The proposed ``all-in-one'' DMF system provides an on-site ``sample to answer'' time of approximately 60 min, which can be a powerful tool for point-of-care molecular diagnostics.},

Regarding fluidic-level synthesis, many related studies and CAD tools have been welldeveloped to synthesize the fluidic behaviors efficiently and effectively. However, research findings being highly-concerned with the chip-level design are still critically lacking. In this paper, we shall focus on chiplevel design and discuss related background and two major optimization problems posed by electrode addressing and control pin routing. We show how CAD tools are involved to automate and optimize the two design problems.

  abstract = {Recent advances of digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) have revolutionized the traditional laboratory procedures. By providing the droplet-based system, DMFB can perform real-time biological analysis and safety-critical biomedical applications. However, different droplets being transported and manipulated on the DMFB may introduce the contamination problem caused by liquid residue between different biomolecules. To overcome this problem, a wash droplet is introduced to clean the contaminations on the surface of the microfluidic array. However, current scheduling of wash droplet does not restrict the extra used cells and execution time of bioassay, thereby degrading the reliability and fault-tolerance significantly. In this paper, we propose a contamination aware droplet routing algorithm for DMFBs. To reduce the routing complexity and the used cells, we first construct preferred routing tracks by analyzing the global moving vector of droplets to guide the droplet routing. To cope with contaminations within one subproblem, we first apply a kshortest path routing technique to minimize the contaminated spots. Then, to take advantage of multiple wash droplets, we adopt a minimum cost circulation (MCC) algorithm for optimal wash-droplet routing to simultaneously minimize used cells and the cleaning time. Since the droplet routing problem consists of several subproblems, a look-ahead prediction technique is further used to determine the contaminations between successive subproblems. After that, we can simultaneously clean both contaminations within one subproblem and those between successive subproblems by using the MCC-based algorithm to reduce the execution time and the used cells significantly. Based on four widely used bioassays, our algorithm reduces the used cells and the execution time significantly compared with the state-of-theart algorithm.},

  abstract = {The microfluidic technology for function microsphere synthesis has high control precision. However, the throughput is too low for industrial scale-up applications. Current scale-up design focuses on a multi-channel in 2D, in which the distribution uniformity parameter {$\delta$} increases linearly, resulting in the deterioration of the flow distribution performance. The 3D modular scale-up strategy could greatly alleviate this problem, but no design principles have been developed yet. For the first time, this paper establishes the microfluidic 3D scale-up design criteria. Based on the modular design concept, the design method of 2D and 3D throughput scale-up parameters N and M, distribution uniformity parameters {$\delta$} and {$\beta$}, and microchannel design parameter KR were proposed. The equivalent resistance coefficient was defined, and the influence of different parameters on a 2D array and 3D stack was analyzed. Furthermore, the error correction method was studied. It was found that the twostage scale-up process contradicted each other. A good scale-up performance of one stage led to the limitation of another stage. Increasing the resistance of each channel Ru could both increase the two-stage scale-up performance, which was an important factor. A single-module scale-up system with 8 channels in a single array and 10 arrays in a vertical stack, which had 80 channels in total, was designed and fabricated based on the proposed design criteria for generating Chitosan/TiO2 composite microspheres. The average particle size was 539.65 {\textmu}m and CV value was about 3.59\%. The throughput was 480\,ml h-1, which effectively increased the throughput scale and the product quality.},

  abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has spread worldwide and caused more than six million deaths globally. Therefore, a timely and accurate diagnosis method is of pivotal importance for controlling the dissemination and expansions. Nucleic acid detection by the reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method generally requires centralized diagnosis laboratories and skilled operators, significantly restricting its use in rural areas and field settings. The digital microfluidic (DMF) technique provides a better option for simultaneous detections of multiple pathogens with fewer specimens and easy operation. In this study, we developed a novel digital microfluidic RT-qPCR platform for multiple detections of respiratory pathogens. This method can simultaneously detect eleven respiratory pathogens, namely, mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP), chlamydophila pneumoniae (CP), streptococcus pneumoniae (SP), human respiratory syncytial virus A (RSVA), human adenovirus (ADV), human coronavirus (HKU1), human coronavirus 229E (HCoV229E), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2), influenza A virus (FLUA) and influenza B virus (FLUB). The diagnostic performance was evaluated using positive plasmids samples and clinical specimens compared with off-chip individual RT-PCR testing. The results showed that the limit of detections was around 12 to 150 copies per test. The true positive rate, true negative rate, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of DMF on-chip method were 93.33\%, 100\%, 100\%, 99.56\%, and 99.85\%, respectively, as validated by the off-chip RT-qPCR counterpart. Collectively, this study reported a cost-effective, high sensitivity and specificity on-chip DMF RT-qPCR system for detecting multiple respiratory pathogens, which will greatly contribute to timely and effective clinical management of respiratory infections in medical resource-limited settings.},

  abstract = {A prototype aerosol detection system is presented that is designed to accurately and quickly measure the concentration of selected inorganic ions in the atmosphere. The aerosol detection system combines digital microfluidics technology, aerosol impaction and chemical detection integrated on the same chip. Target compounds are the major inorganic aerosol constituents: sulfate, nitrate and ammonium. The digital microfluidic system consists of top and bottom plates that sandwich a fluid layer. Nozzles for an inertial impactor are built into the top plate according to known, scaling principles. The deposited air particles are densely concentrated in well-defined deposits on the bottom plate containing droplet actuation electrodes of the chip in fixed areas. The aerosol collection efficiency for particles larger than 100 nm in diameter was higher than 95\%. After a collection phase, deposits are dissolved into a scanning droplet. Due to a sub-microliter droplet size, the obtained extract is highly concentrated. Droplets then pass through an air/oil interface on chip for colorimetric analysis by spectrophotometry using optical fibers placed between the two plates of the chip. To create a standard curve for each analyte, six different concentrations of liquid standards were chosen for each assay and dispensed from on-chip reservoirs. The droplet mixing was completed in a few seconds and the final droplet was transported to the detection position as soon as the mixing was finished. Limits of detection (LOD) in the final droplet were determined to be 11 ppm for sulfate and 0.26 ppm for ammonium. For nitrate, it was impossible to get stable measurements. The LOD of the on-chip measurements for sulfate was close to that obtained by an off-chip method using a Tecan spectrometer. LOD of the on-chip method for ammonium was about five times larger than what was obtained with the off-chip method. For the current impactor collection air flow (1 L/min) and 1 h collection time, the converted LODs in air were: 0.275 {\textmu}g/m3 for sulfate, 6.5 ng/m3 for ammonium, sufficient for most ambient air monitoring applications.},

In this paper, we reviewed droplet detection and active sorting methods that are currently still being widely used for high-through screening applications in microfluidic systems, including the latest updates regarding each technology.

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) have been widely used in biochemical experiments with high safety requirements. To ensure the reliability of the experiment, it is necessary to use test droplets to perform off-line and on-line testing for DMFBs. Previous random search algorithms are not fully combined with heuristic information, which increases the randomness of search progress and thus results in suboptimal test paths. To solve this problem, a new test path optimization method based on priority strategy and genetic algorithm is proposed, which reduces the blindness of test path search and improves the convergence effect of the random search algorithm. In this method, priority levels are randomly assigned to the edges of the chip test model. With the fluid constraints, a test droplet moves to the untraversed adjacent edge with the highest priority. If all adjacent edges have been traversed, Floyd algorithm is used to determine the shortest path from the test droplet to untraversed edges, and guide the test droplet to move along the shortest path. After determining the test path according to priority strategy, the priority level on the test path is optimized by genetic algorithm, so that the length of the path is gradually reduced by iteration. In this paper, a single test droplet is used to test given chips. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient, and the shortest path length is equal to the length of the Euler path, indicating that the shortest test path has reached the optimal value. Moreover, for the ``deadlock'' problem of droplets in on-line testing process, we also provide a solution by using backoff operation.},

  abstract = {As the microfluidic technology advances, the design complexity of digital microfluidic biochips (DMFB) are expected to explode in the near future. One of the most critical challenges for DMFB design is the droplet routing problem, which schedules the movement of each droplet in a time-multiplexed manner. In this paper, we propose a fast routability- and performancedriven droplet router for DMFBs. The main contributions of our work are: (1) a global moving vector analysis for constructing preferred routing tracks to minimize the number of used unit cells; (2) an entropy-based equation to determine the routing order of droplets for better routability; (3) a routing compaction technique by dynamic programming to minimize the latest arrival time of droplets. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves 100\% routing completion for all test cases on three Benchmark Suites while the previous algorithms are not. In addition to routability, compared with the state-of-theart high-performance routing on the Benchmark Suite I [3], the experimental results still show that our algorithm performed better in runtime by 40\%, reduced the latest arrival time by 21\%, reduced the used unit cells by 10\%. Furthermore, experiment results on Benchmark Suite II and III are also very promising. Based on the evaluation of three Benchmark Suites, our algorithm demonstrates the efficiency and robustness of handling complex droplet routing problem over the existing algorithms.},

To meet the challenges of increasing design complexity, computer-aideddesign (CAD) tools have been involved to build DMFBs efficiently. Current CAD tools generally conduct a twostage based design flow of fluidic-level synthesis followed by chip-level design to optimize fluidic behaviors and chip architecture separately. Nevertheless, existing fluidic-chip design gap will become even wider with a rapid escalation in the number of assay operations incorporated into a single DMFB. As more and more large-scale assay protocols are delivered in current emerging marketplace, this problem may potentially restrict the effectiveness and feasibility of the entire DMFB realization and thus needs to be solved quickly. In this paper, we propose the first fluidicchip co-design methodology for DMFBs to effectively bridge the fluidic-chip design gap. Our work provides a comprehensive integration throughout fluidic-operation scheduling, chip layout generation, control pin assignment, and wiring solution to achieve higher design performance and feasibility. Experimental results show the effectiveness, robustness, and scalability of our co-design methodology on a set of real-life assay applications.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) is a mechanism that allows physical handling of liquids with only electrical signals, such as digitizing a liquid into tiny droplets and manipulating them on a chip, thus enabling ``digital microfluidics''. As an elegantly simple platform free of pumps or valves, EWOD digital microfluidics has been attracting high research interest in the past two decades and has recently been transitioned to a few commercial products in displays and biochemistry. However, the number of labs utilizing this technology is still small, due to the difficulty in translating design intent to manufactured devices. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a cloud-based opensource EWOD cybermanufacturing ecosystem that enables an automatic translation from user requirements to manufactured digital microfluidics. The incubation cyber ecosystem is to be accessible to a wide range of end users, allowing researchers, entrepreneurs, students, and hobbyists alike to focus on their own ideas and applications without having to master the subtleties of EWOD engineering and manufacturing. This can be thought of as an ``operating system'' for EWOD community, similar to Windows and macOS for people with no computer hardware background. The proposed cyber ecosystem aims to ease the process of designing and eliminate the burden of fabricating EWOD chips so that the user pool is increased and more applications found for EWOD digital microfluidics.},

The sensor performance is typically described based on the penetration depth of the electric field into the sample material, the sensor signal strength and its sensitivity. These factors all depend on the geometry and material properties of the sensor and sample. In this paper, a detailed analysis is provided, through finite element simulations, of the ways in which the sensor's geometrical parameters affect its performance. The geometrical parameters include the number of digits forming the interdigital electrodes and the ratio of digit width to their separation. In addition, the influence of the presence or absence of a metal backplane on the sample is analyzed. Further, the effects of sensor substrate thickness and material on signal strength are studied. The results of the analysis show that it is necessary to take into account a trade-off between the desired sensitivity and penetration depth when designing the sensor. Parametric equations are presented to assist the sensor designer or nondestructive evaluation specialist in optimizing the design of a capacitive sensor.},

It can solve the problem of the test path repetition in the partition method, as well as the droplet fluid conflict in the traditional non-partition method. Firstly, a hybrid algorithm based on priority strategy and genetic algorithm is designed to optimize the parallel test path of the biochip, so as to avoid the problem that the search process is too random when only a single intelligent algorithm is used to optimize the test path. Then an adaptive method is proposed to adjust the amount of test tasks, which can improve the average distribution method of test tasks and further optimize the parallel test of the digital microfluidic biochip. The test simulation of nine different array chips shows that the serial-parallel conversion strategy proposed in this paper is better than the partition strategy, and the experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the test efficiency of digital microfluidic biochips and reduce the test cost.},

  abstract = {Two methods were studied for selectively measuring the on-chip absorbance of trace sulfate analytes in droplets on a digital microfluidics (DMF) platform. In one method, the direction of measurement was perpendicular to the flat upper and lower surfaces of the DMF platform (vertical), and in the second method, the measurement direction was parallel to the DMF platform surfaces (horizontal). The channel height or the vertical light path length was 0.24 mm, and the droplet diameter was 1 mm. The DMF system employed a silicone oil transport medium whereby a thin, non-uniform oil layer formed between the droplet and the upper/lower plates which was unstable, resulting in randomly formed local oil lenses. The mobile oil lenses caused vertical absorbance measurement errors and uncertainties. The effects of the oil lenses were verified by simulation. Horizontal absorbance measurements were taken with embedded optical fibers (0.2 mm in diameter) aligned over the bottom chip surface in contact with the sides of the droplet, resulting in a horizontal light path length approximately three times that of the vertical light path. Because no oil lenses could form on the droplet's sides, the stability of repeated horizontal measurements outperformed repeated vertical measurements made on the same droplet and on multiple droplets actuated into the measurement positions. Comparisons were based on measurement standard deviations and limits of detection (LOD). The following LODs and measurement standard deviations were achieved for horizontal measurements of multiple sulfate concentrations in 1.5 {\textmu}l droplets: 7 ppm for sulfate (0.3--2.7\%) and an R2 value of 0.957 from a least square data fit. Measurements on a commercial plate reader gave comparable results (200 {\textmu}l liquid in each well, LOD equals 11 ppm, CV equals to 0.2--4\%), even though the absorbance path was larger (0.7 mm). This LOD value means that the chip could detect 10.5 ng of sulfate. LOD values on vertical measurements were also similar, but large measurement errors from numerous outlier points yielded an R2 value of 0.735 and large average measurement standard deviations (36\%).},

To reduce the pin count, broadcast addressing, by minimally grouping electrode sets with non-conflict signal merging, has emerged as a promising solution. Nevertheless, naive signal merging has the potential to cause excessive electrode actuations, which has been reported to have direct and adverse effect on chip reliability. According to recent studies, reliability is an important attribute for PDMFBs particularly developed for medical applications as it directly affects the final medical decision making. However, no research findings have been reported on the reliability problem in pin-constrained designs. To make PDMFBs more feasible for practical applications, we propose in this paper the first matchingbased reliability-oriented broadcast-addressing algorithm for PDMFBs. We identify the factors that affect reliability and incorporate into the design-technique attributes that enhance reliability. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Although it was shown to be compatible with on-line mass spectrometric detection, due to numerous technical obstacles, the implementation of DMF in conjunction with MS is still beyond the reach of many analytical laboratories. Here we present a facile method for coupling open DMF microchips to mass spectrometers using Venturi easy ambient sonic-spray ionization operated at atmospheric pressure. The proposed interface comprises a 3D-printed body that can easily be ``clipped'' at the inlet of a standard mass spectrometer. The accessory features all the necessary connections for an open-architecture DMF microchip with T-shaped electrode arrangement, thermostatting of the microchip, purification of air (to prevent accidental contamination of the microchip), a Venturi pump, and two microfluidic pumps to facilitate transfer of samples and reagents onto the microchip. The system also incorporates a touch-screen panel and remote control for user-friendly operation.

  abstract = {In point-of-care testing (POCT), tests are performed near patients and results are given rapidly for timely clinical decisions. Immunodiagnostic assays are one of the most important analyses for detecting and quantifying proteinbased biomarkers. However, existing POCT immunodiagnostics mainly rely on the lateral flow assay (LFA), which has limited sensitivity or quantification capability. Although other immunodiagnostic assays, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), offer more sensitive and quantitative results, they require complex liquid manipulations that are difficult to implement in POCT settings by conventional means. Here, we show the development of DropLab, an automated sample-in-answer-out POCT immunodiagnostic platform based on magnetic digital microfluidic (MDM) technology. DropLab performs microbead-based ELISA in droplets to offer more sensitive and quantitative testing results. The intricate liquid manipulations required for ELISA are accomplished by controlling droplets with magnetic microbeads using MDM technology, which enables us to achieve full automation and easy operations with DropLab. Four ELISAs (the sample in triplicates and a negative control) can be run in parallel on the thermoformed disposable chip, which greatly improves the throughput and accuracy compared to those of other POCT immunodiagnostic devices. DropLab was validated by measuring two protein targets and one antibody target. The testing results showed that the limit of detection (LOD) of DropLab matched that of the conventional ELISA in a microwell plate. DropLab brings MDM one step closer to being a viable medical technology that is ready for real-world POCT applications.},

Potential technological applications are manifold, from novel materials to scaffolds for tissue engineering or enhanced oil recovery. More fundamentally, microfluidics makes it possible to investigate the physics of complex systems such as foams at scales where the capillary forces become dominant, in model experiments involving few well-controlled parameters. In this context, this review does not have the ambition to detail in a comprehensive manner all the techniques and applications involving bubbles and foams in microfluidics. Rather, it focuses on particular consequences of working at the microscale, under confinement, and hopes to provide insight into the physics of such systems. The first part of this work focuses on bubbles, and more precisely on (i) bubble generation, where the confinement can suppress capillary instabilities while inertial effects may play a role, and (ii) bubble dynamics, paying special attention to the lubrication film between bubble and wall and the influence of confinement. The second part addresses the formation and dynamics of microfoams, emphasizing structural differences from macroscopic foams and the influence of the confinement.},

While microfluidic devices have shown their capability in point-of-care applications, some of them face the challenge in on-chip sample preparation, such as DNA extraction from blood samples, prior to the diagnosis. Although digital microfluidic (DMF) eliminates the need of complicated fluidic actuation components and draws great attentions as a promising Lab-on-a-Chip platform, its capability in DNA extraction has been limitedly shown. Herein, we develop a protocol on a DMF platform for DNA extraction. As the protocol contains blood, magnetic beads, a variety of liquids, and complicated steps, it was implemented in a sequence of droplet operations with our proposed washing/droplet-separation strategy. Our on-chip extraction protocol was conducted with room-temperature incubations and much less washing cycles. The results were confirmed by using SYBR-Green dye staining and gel electrophoresis. Therefore, the DMF device was shown to permit on-chip DNA extraction with fewer sample/reagent consumption and shorter operation time.},

Over the past decade, a number of microfluidics design-automation techniques have been developed for on-chip droplet manipulation. However, these methods overlook the myriad complexities of biomolecular protocols and they have yet to make a significant impact in biochemistry/microbiology research. A paradigm shift in biochip design automation and a ``phase transition'' in research are clearly needed to bridge this gap between microfluidics and microbiology. In this paper, we explain how researchers from design-automation and embedded systems can play a key role in this transition. We present a new synthesis flow that uses realistic models of biomolecular protocols and cyberphysical adaptation to address real-world microbiology applications. We also present a list of metrics that can be used for the assessment of designautomation techniques for microbiology applications.},

However, today's solutions suffer from the drawback that multiple sample pathways are not supported and on-chip reconfigurable devices are not efficiently exploited. As a result, impractical manual intervention is needed to process protocols for gene-expression analysis. To overcome this problem, we first describe our benchtop experimental studies to understand gene-expression analysis and its relationship to the biochip design specification. We then introduce an integrated framework for quantitative gene-expression analysis using digital-microfluidic biochips. The proposed framework includes: (i) a spatial-reconfiguration technique that incorporates resourcesharing specifications into the synthesis flow; (ii) an interactive firmware that collects and analyzes sensor data based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction; (iii) a real-time resourceallocation scheme that responds promptly to decisions about the protocol flow received from the firmware layer. This framework is combined with cyberphysical integration to develop the first design-automation framework for quantitative gene expression. Simulation results show that our adaptive framework efficiently utilizes on-chip resources to reduce time-to-result without sacrificing the chip's lifetime.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Phosphorus is an essential element for water quality control. Excessive amounts of phosphorus causes algal bloom in water, which leads to eutrophication and a decline in water quality. It is necessary to maintain the optimum amount of phosphorus present. During the last decades, various studies have been conducted to determine phosphorus content in water. In this study, we present a comprehensive overview of colorimetric, electrochemical, fluorescence, microfluidic, and remote sensing technologies for the measurement of phosphorus in water, along with their working principles and limitations. Results: The colorimetric techniques determine the concentration of phosphorus through the use of colorgenerating reagents. This is specific to a single chemical species and inexpensive to use. The electrochemical techniques operate by using a reaction of the analyte of interest to generate an electrical signal that is proportional to the sample analyte concentration. They show a good linear output, good repeatability, and a high detection capacity. The fluorescence technique is a kind of spectroscopic analysis method. The particles in the sample are excited by irradiation at a specific wavelength, emitting radiation of a different wavelength. It is possible to use this for quantitative and qualitative analysis of the target analyte. The microfluidic techniques incorporate several features to control chemical reactions in a micro device of low sample volume and reagent consumption. They are cheap and rapid methods for the detection of phosphorus in water. The remote sensing technique analyzes the sample for the target analyte using an optical technique, but without direct contact. It can cover a wider area than the other techniques mentioned in this review. Conclusion: It is concluded that the sensing technologies reviewed in this study are promising for rapid detection of phosphorus in water. The measurement range and sensitivity of the sensors have been greatly improved recently.},

Both the grooved and nongrooved substrates are considered. For this purpose, the governing equations for the two phase fluid flow are solved using the finite element method, and the phase field method is used for interface tracking. We show that for four types of the considered grooves in the microchannel, different changes in the fluid dynamics are observed. When the droplets pass over the grooves, the velocity decreases and the pressure drop increases. These behaviors are intensified when the size of the grooves increases. In the shear thinning fluids, the velocity reduction is larger and even causes the drop to stop. However, in the shear thickening fluids, the velocity reduction is smaller, and the droplets can cross the grooves. After the grooves, the velocity of the droplets increases suddenly. Finally, it is shown that the time of separation of a droplet in the splitting process completely depends on the fluid type, which is much less in the shear thinning fluids compared to the shear thickening types.},

  abstract = {Double-sided electrohydrodynamic jet printing of circuitry using silver nanowires (AgNWs) and dispensing of high viscosity silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) is demonstrated for the first time in the fabrication of a two-dimensional array of electrodes (3D circuitry) on a single sheet of paper. The penetration of AgNW ink through the paper's thickness by capillary imbibition allows for multilayer electrical access to connect the individual electrodes. This makes it an automated and efficient choice as the functional area of the device is conserved and the surface of the paper is preserved. This allows for two-dimensional droplet manipulation on a paper-based digital microfluidics (PBDMF) platform. Compared to printed circuit board technology, paper-based electronics offer a range of desirable properties: they are light weight, portable, economical, flexible, biodegradable, and the materials are abundantly available. The fabricated PBDMF chip is demonstrated to be a low-cost, fully reconfigurable, and disposable point-of-care diagnostic platform for the environmental sensing of pesticide using organophosphorus hydrolase enzyme through colorimetric detection via smartphone.},

Hence, water quality monitoring has become a prime activity worldwide. The available monitoring procedures are inadequate as most of them require expensive instrumentation, longer processing time, tedious processes, and skilled lab technicians. Therefore, a portable, sensitive, and selective sensor with in situ and continuous water quality monitoring is the current necessity. In this context, microfluidics is the promising technology to fulfill this need due to its advantages such as faster reaction times, better process control, reduced waste generation, system compactness and parallelization, reduced cost, and disposability. This paper presents a review on the latest enhancements of microfluidic-based electrochemical and optical sensors for water quality monitoring and discusses the relative merits and shortcomings of the methods.},

For fast switching and continuous applications, hotplate or Peltier elements can be employed. However, due to bulkiness, they are ineffective for portable applications or operation at remote locations. Miniaturization of heaters reduces power consumption and bulkiness, enhances the thermal response, and integrates with several sensors or microfluidic chips. The microheater has a thickness of\,{\textasciitilde}\,100 nm to\,{\textasciitilde}\,100 {$\mu$}m and offers a temperature range up to 1900{\textcelsius} with precise control. In recent years, due to the escalating demand for flexible electronics, thin-film microheaters have emerged as an imperative research area. This review provides an overview of recent advancements in microheater as well as analyses different microheater designs, materials, fabrication, and temperature control. In addition, the applications of microheaters in gas sensing, biological, and electrical and mechanical sectors are emphasized. Moreover, the maximum temperature, voltage, power consumption, response time, and heating rate of each microheater are tabulated. Finally, we addressed the specific key considerations for designing and fabricating a microheater as well as the importance of microheater integration in COVID-19 diagnostic kits. This review thereby provides general guidelines to researchers to integrate microheater in micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), which may pave the way for developing rapid and large-scale SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic kits in resource-constrained clinical or home-based environments.},

  abstract = {As a revolutionary platform for miniaturizing laboratory procedures, the digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) has the advantages of flexibility and re-configurability over its flow-based counterpart. Droplet routing is one of the most challenging problems in the design automation of DMFBs, which aims to schedule the movements of a set of droplets from their source electrodes to their target electrodes and satisfy both static and dynamic fluidic constraints. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary algorithm (EA) based droplet routing method with an indirect encoding scheme and an improved Dijkstra-based decoding strategy, to minimize the arrival time of the droplets. To be specific, the priority of the movements of the droplets are encoded in the chromosome instead of directly encoding the solution of the problem, i.e., a complete path from the source to the target for each droplet. In the 2D-routing decoding stage, a problem-specific cost function is defined and introduced in the Dijkstra algorithm for obtaining a more time-efficient path for each droplet. Meanwhile, to avoid accidental mixing of the droplets during their movements, several strategies are proposed to modify the paths for satisfying the fluidic constraints in different scenarios of both 2D-routing and 3D-compaction. Compared with the stateof-the-art droplet routing algorithms, the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method based on two synthetic benchmark suites and a real-world bioassay benchmark suite.},

  abstract = {Digital (i.e., droplet-based) microfluidics, by the electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) mechanism, has shown great potential for a wide range of applications, such as lab-on-a-chip. While most reported EWOD chips use a series of electrode pads essentially in 1-D line pattern designed for specific tasks, the desired universal chips allowing user-reconfigurable paths would require the electrode pads in 2-D pattern. However, to electrically access the electrode pads independently, conductive lines need to be fabricated underneath the pads in multiple layers, raising a cost issue particularly for disposable chip applications. In this paper, we report the building of digital microfluidic plates based on a printed circuit board (PCB), in which multilayer electrical access lines were created inexpensively using the mature PCB technology. However, due to its surface topography and roughness and resulting high resistance against droplet movement, the as-fabricated PCB surfaces require high ({$\sim$}500 V) voltages unless coated with or immersed in oil. Our goal is the EWOD operations of droplets not only on oil-covered surfaces but also on dry ones. To meet the varying levels of performances, three types of gradually complex post-PCB microfabrication process are developed and evaluated. By introducing land-grid-array sockets in the packaging, a scalable digital microfluidic system with a reconfigurable and low-cost chip is also demonstrated.},

Conventional methods for foodborne pathogen detection are time-consuming and laborious due to the requirement of a series of processes including cell enrichment, isolation and morphological identification. Therefore the demand for rapid, sensitive, inexpensive and convenient approaches to detect foodborne pathogenic bacteria has emerged in recent years. Among the new approaches, microfluidic chip-based detection has generated growing interest because of the miniaturized size, improved sensitivity and reduced detection time of the devices. In addition, the applications of nanomaterials and magnetic microbeads have further facilitated target recognition and signal transduction processes in microfluidic pathogen detection. The lab-on-a-chip technique has developed into an alternative to conventional methods to detect foodborne pathogens owing to its potentials to offer desired sensitivity and to respond in a short test time. Most recently, smartphones and 3-D printing technologies are attracting growing attention for enhanced detection performances. This paper reviews the most recent developments and trends in miniaturized microfluidic devices based on different recognition principles and signal amplification methods to detect foodborne pathogens. In particular, emphasis will be put on those that offer both rapid detection result turn-around and ultra-low detection limit of 10               2               to 10               3               cells per mL or even single-cell detection.},

The two technologies are essential in the point-of-care area. Electrochemical detection on electrodes and DMF-based droplet driving electrode realize their respective functions by means of electrical signals. In terms of working mode, it seems to have certain similarity, and electrochemical sensing seems to be more suitable for integrating digital microfluidic systems. We thus integrated electrochemical sensing on an active matrix (AM) DMF system. As a common transparent conductive glass, indium tin oxide (ITO) has been widely used as the top plate of the digital microfluidic chip. In this work, we used ITO glass with patterned interdigital electrodes as the top plate of the AM-DMF chip. We achieved on-chip droplet volume detection by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). We also proposed a novel sample dilution method on the DMF chip. It takes only 30 seconds to dilute solutions into 4 different concentrations. We then analyzed droplet samples of different concentrations with EIS method. And the correlation coefficient of the fitted curve is as high as 0.9964. In conclusion, EIS is a powerful detection technology for fast, high-integration and low-cost detection on DMF system. The integration of EIS and DMF can be used in various biochemical analyses in the future.},

The generation of well-defined micro-droplets on a chip with restricted device geometries has become a real obstacle for digital microfluidics platforms to be used in parallel for               in vitro               diagnostic applications. Here, we propose a ``one-to-three'' droplet splitting technique that is able to generate sub-microlitre droplets beyond the ``well-known'' geometry limit in electrowetting-on-dielectric digital microfluidics. Accordingly, we realized an on-chip magnetic bead chemiluminescence immunoassay for parallel detection with the ``one-to-three'' technique. With the help of the generated micro droplets, we were able to retain the magnetic beads by a significantly reduced magnetic force. We have shown the detection of five B-type natriuretic peptide analyte samples on a single chip for around 10 minutes.

Conventionally, EWOD-DMF platforms are manufactured in cleanrooms by expert technicians using costly and time consuming micro-nanofabrication processes such as optical lithography, depositions and etching. However, such high-end microfabrication facilities are extremely challenging to establish in resource-poor and low-income countries, due to their high capital investment and operating costs. This makes the fabrication of EWOD-DMF platforms extremely challenging in low-income countries, where such platforms are most needed for many applications such as point-of-care testing applications. To address this challenge, we present a low-cost and simple fabrication procedure for EWOD-DMF electrode arrays, which can be performed anywhere with a commercial office inkjet printer without the need of expensive cleanroom facilities. We demonstrate the utility of our platform to move and mix droplets of different reagents and physiologically conductive buffers, thereby showing its capability to potentially perform a variety of biochemical assays. By combining our low-cost, inkjet-printed EWOD-DMF platform with smartphone imaging technology and a compact control system for droplet manipulation, we also demonstrate a portable and hand-held device which can be programmed to potentially perform a variety of biochemical assays.},

Compared with devices in bulky or planar formats, the long shaft-like forms of implantable devices are easily placed in the organs with minimized outward protrusions via injection or insertion processes. Adding flexibility to the devices also enables effortless insertions through complex biological cavities, such as the cochlea, and enhances chronic reliability by complying with natural body movements, such as the heartbeat. Diverse types of such injectable implants developed for different organs are reviewed and the electronic, optoelectronic, piezoelectric, and microfluidic devices that enable stimulations and measurements of site-specific regions in the body are discussed. Noninvasive penetration strategies to deliver the miniscule devices are also considered.

  abstract = {Interdigitated Electrodes (IDEs) based sensor in comb-like electrodes structure is also an attractive candidate in gas sensor and biosensor applications, owing to its simple structural design. The sensitivity can be improved based on geometric parameters of the sensor. Hence, in this paper, we study the physical model of the IDEs-based sensor and concern with its geometrical parameters (gap sizes, number of fingers and width of fingers) based on the finite element simulations using COMSOL Multiphysics. The simulation results were used to show the electrical field that generated by the IDEs and compare to other to find the optimum design. Based on the results, the relationship between the geometric parameters and the IDEs performances are studied. The simulation results show that the higher electric fields are generated with the smaller gap size and smaller width of fingers. Besides that, the results show that the gap size and the width of fingers affect the IDEs performance significantly compared to the number of fingers. The IDE with the design 18 fingers, 0.1 mm gap size between fingers and 0.1 mm width of the finger is the optimum design which generates 30.6 kV/m average of electric field magnitude.},

  abstract = {With the rapid growth of emerging point-of-use (POU)/point-of-care (POC) detection technologies, miniaturized sensors for the real-time detection of gases and airborne pathogens have become essential to fight pollution, emerging contaminants, and pandemics. However, the low-cost development of miniaturized gas sensors without compromising selectivity, sensitivity, and response time remains challenging. Microfluidics is a promising technology that has been exploited for decades to overcome such limitations, making it an excellent candidate for POU/POC. However, microfluidic-based gas sensors remain a nascent field. In this review, the evolution of microfluidic gas sensors from basic electronic techniques to more advanced optical techniques such as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy to detect analytes is documented in detail. This paper focuses on the various detection methodologies used in microfluidic-based devices for detecting gases and airborne pathogens. Non-continuous microfluidic devices such as bubble/droplet-based microfluidics technology that have been employed to detect gases and airborne pathogens are also discussed. The selectivity, sensitivity, advantages/disadvantages vis-a-vis response time, and fabrication costs for all the microfluidic sensors are tabulated. The microfluidic sensors are grouped based on the target moiety, such as air pollutants such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, and airborne pathogens such as E. coli and SARS-CoV-2. The possible application scenarios for the various microfluidic devices are critically examined.},

Microdroplets present several unique characteristics of interest to a broader research community. The main distinguishing features include (i) large numbers of isolated compartments of tiny volumes that are ideal for single cell or single molecule assays, (ii) rapid mixing and negligible thermal inertia that all provide excellent control over reaction conditions, and (iii) the presence of two immiscible liquids and the interface between them that enables new or exotic processes (the synthesis of new functional materials and structures that are otherwise difficult to obtain, studies of the functions and properties of lipid and polymer membranes and execution of reactions at liquid--liquid interfaces). The most frequent application of droplet microfluidics relies on the generation of large numbers of compartments either for ultrahigh throughput screens or for the synthesis of functional materials composed of millions of droplets or particles. Droplet microfluidics has already evolved into a complex field. In this review we focus on `controlled droplet microfluidics' -- a portfolio of techniques that provide convenient platforms for multistep complex reaction protocols and that take advantage of automated and passive methods of fluid handling on a chip. `Controlled droplet microfluidics' can be regarded as a group of methods capable of addressing and manipulating droplets in series. The functionality and complexity of controlled droplet microfluidic systems can be positioned between digital microfluidics (DMF) addressing each droplet individually using 2D arrays of electrodes and ultrahigh throughput droplet microfluidics focused on the generation of hundreds of thousands or even millions of picoliter droplets that cannot be individually addressed by their location on a chip.},

This review focuses on the use of mPADs that have the potential to work without batteries or with only small and portable devices such as smartphones, timers, or miniaturized detectors. The mPADs that can be operated without batteries are, in general, those that allow the visual judgment of analyte concentrations via readouts that are measured in time, distance, count, or text. Conversely, a smartphone works as a camera to permit the capture and processing of an image that digitizes the color intensity produced by the reaction of an analyte with a colorimetric reagent. Miniaturized detectors for electrochemical, fluorometric, chemiluminescence, and electrochemiluminescence methods are also discussed, although some of them require the use of a laptop computer for operation and data processing.},

Conventional methods of detecting antibiotic-resistant pathogens do not assess the resistance mechanism and are often time-consuming and laborious. We have developed a magnetic digital microfluidic (MDM) platform, known as MDM Carba, for the identification of CPE by measuring their ability to hydrolyze carbapenem antibiotics. MDM Carba offers the ability to rapidly test CPE and reduce the amount of reagents used compared with conventional phenotypic testing. On the MDM Carba platform, tests are performed in droplets that function as reaction chambers, and fluidic operations are accomplished by manipulating these droplets with magnetic force. The simple droplet-based magnetic fluidic operation allows easy system automation and simplified hands-on operation. Because of the unique ``power-free'' operation of MDM technology, the MDM Carba platform can also be operated manually, showing great potential for point-of-care testing in resource-limited settings. We tested 27 bacterial isolates on the MDM Carba platform, and the results showed sensitivity and specificity that were comparable to those of the widely used Carba NP test. MDM Carba may shorten the overall turnaround time for CPE identification, thereby enabling more timely clinical decisions for better clinical outcomes.

To achieve a wide range of droplet manipulation, hydrophilic patterns, known as surface energy traps, are introduced onto the Teflon-coated hydrophobic substrate. However, the Teflon-coated substrate is difficult to modify because it is nonwettable, and existing techniques for patterning surface energy traps have many limitations. Inspired by the mussel adhesion mechanism, we use polydopamine, a bioinspired substance that adheres strongly to almost any materials, to pattern surface energy traps on the Teflon-coated substrate with a great ease. We have optimized the polydopamine coating protocol and characterized the surface properties of the polydopamine surface energy traps. Droplet operations including particle extraction, liquid dispensing, liquid shaping, and cross-platform transfer have been demonstrated on the polydopamine surface energy trap-enabled magnetic digital microfluidic platform in both single-plate and two-plate configurations. Furthermore, the detection of hepatitis B surface antigen using ELISA has been demonstrated on the new magnetic dgitial microfluidic platform.

Using a sharpinterface scheme, capable of efficiently modeling the flow over complex surfaces, we perform 2D and 3D finite element simulations for a wide range of substrate wettabilities, i.e., from hydrophilic to superhydrophobic surfaces. Our results demonstrate that the contact angle hysteresis, due to the presence of the solid structures, is responsible for the appearance of a critical thermal gradient beyond which droplet migration is possible; the latter has been reported by experimental observations. The migration velocity as well as the direction of motion strongly depend on the combined action of the net mechanical force along the contact line and the thermocapillary induced flow at the liquid-air interface. We also show that through proper control and design of the substrate wettability, contact angle hysteresis, and induced flow field it is possible to manipulate the droplet dynamics: in particular, controlling its motion along a predefined track or entrapping by a wetting defect a droplet based on its size, as well as providing appropriate conditions for enhanced mixing inside the droplet.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the past and recent studies on thermocapillarity in relation to microfluidics. The role of thermocapillarity as the change of surface tension due to temperature gradient in developing Marangoni flow in liquid films and conclusively bubble and drop actuation is discussed. The thermocapillary-driven mass transfer (the so-called Benard-Marangoni effect) can be observed in liquid films, reservoirs, bubbles and droplets that are subject to the temperature gradient. Since the contribution of a surface tension-driven flow becomes more prominent when the scale becomes smaller as compared to a pressure-driven flow, microfluidic applications based on thermocapillary effect are gaining attentions recently. The effect of thermocapillarity on the flow pattern inside liquid films is the initial focus of this review. Analysis of the relation between evaporation and thermocapillary instability approves the effect of Marangoni flow on flow field inside the drop and its evaporation rate. The effect of thermocapillary on producing Marangoni flow inside drops and liquid films, leads to actuation of drops and bubbles due to the drag at the interface, mass conservation, and also gravity and buoyancy in vertical motion. This motion can happen inside microchannels with a closed multiphase medium, on the solid substrate as in solid/liquid interaction, or on top of a carrier liquid film in open microfluidic systems. Various thermocapillary-based microfluidic devices have been proposed and developed for different purposes such as actuation, sensing, trapping, sorting, mixing, chemical reaction, and biological assays throughout the years. A list of the thermocapillary based microfluidic devices along with their characteristics, configurations, limitations, and improvements are presented in this review.},

The electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) technology provides dynamic culture conditions in vitro that may better mimic the natural embryo microenvironment. Thus far, EWOD microdevices have been proposed for in vitro gamete and embryo handling in mice and for analyzing the human embryo secretome. This article presents the development of the first microfluidic chip utilizing EWOD technology designed for the manipulation of bovine embryos in vitro. The prototype sustains the cell cycles of embryos manipulated individually on the chips during in vitro culture (IVC). Challenges related to the chip fabrication as well as to its application during bovine embryo IVC in accordance with the adapted on-chip protocol are thoroughly discussed, and future directions for DMF in ARTs are indicated.},

The screening of microfluidic synthesis processes is an urgent task of the experimental process in terms of automation and intellectualization. This study proposes a methodology and software for extracting the morphological and dynamic characteristics of generated monodisperse droplets from video data streams obtained from a digital microscope. For this purpose, the paper considers an approach to generating an extended feature space characterizing the process of droplet generation using a microfluidic device based on the creation of synthetic image datasets. YOLOv7 was used as an algorithm for detecting objects in the images. When training this algorithm, the values in the test dataset mAP@0.5 0.996 were obtained. The algorithms proposed for image processing and analysis implement the basic functionality to extract the morphological and dynamic characteristics of monodisperse droplets in the synthesis process. Laboratory validation and verification of the software demonstrated high results of the identification of key characteristics of the monodisperse droplets generated by the microfluidic device with the average deviation from the real values not exceeding 8\%.},

An external three-electrode system consisting of Au working, Ag reference and Pt auxiliary wires were installed over EWOD electrodes at the end of T-junction mixer. In experiment, a few-microliter droplets of Tris buffer and iodide solutions were moved toward the mixing junction and transported toward electrochemical electrodes by EWOD process. A short processing time within seconds was achieved at EWOD applied voltage of 300 V. The analyte droplets mixed with different concentrations were successfully analyzed by cyclic voltametry.

Current equipment to achieve this, such as syringe and peristaltic pumps, is expensive, large, difficult to program and has limited potential for scalability. Here, we present a new pumping platform that is open-source, low-cost, modular, scalable, fully-programmable and easy to assemble that can be incorporated into cell culture systems to better recapitulate physiological environments. By controlling two commercially available piezoelectric pumps using a Raspberry Pi Zero microcontroller, the system is capable of producing arbitrary dynamic flow profiles with reliable flow rates ranging from 1 to 3000 mL/min as specified by an easily programmable Python-based script. We validated the accuracy of the flow rates, the use of time-varying profiles, and the practicality of the system by creating repeatable dynamic concentration profiles using a 3D-printed static micromixer.},

This technology could provide a practical means to routinely prepare high-SA tracers for applications such as neuroimaging and could make it possible to routinely achieve high SA using synthesis strategies such as isotopic exchange. Reagent droplets are controlled electronically, providing high reliability, a compact control system, and flexibility for diverse syntheses with a single-chip design.

However, all these developments eventually result in an ``inflation'' of different design approaches for routing of DMFBs -- many of them addressing a very dedicated routing task only. In this work, we propose a comprehensive routing methodology which (1) provides one (generic) solution capable of addressing a variety of different design tasks, (2) employs a ``push-button''-scheme that requires no (manual) composition of partial results, and (3) guarantees minimality e.g., with respect to the number of timesteps or the number of required control pins.

  abstract = {Electrowetting has the potential to be applied to steering and concentrating sunlight using liquid lenses. However, the performance of electrowetting devices depends on the careful selection/ fabrication of their constituent dielectric material. The dielectric material should have high optical transparency, chemical stability, high relative permittivity, be relatively thin and have a high breakdown voltage. Recent studies noted that inorganic dielectric materials such as SiO2 are more suitable for beam steering compared to organic dielectric materials such as fluoropolymers or parylene C for example. When optical transmission is not required, electrowetting devices are fabricated by thermally growing SiO2 on top of silicon wafers. However, this deposition method is not suitable for beam steering electrowetting devices as the silicon substrate is not optically transparent. In this paper, we investigated the performance of SiO2 as a dielectric material for beam steering electrowetting devices. Specifically, we measured the contact angle modulation capability of SiO2 produced by electron-beam and sputtering deposition methods and correlated the results with morphological defects of the SiO2 layer introduced by the deposition methods. We investigated the effect of annealing and the performance with ionic and DI water. Finally, we compared the performance of SiO2 with other dielectric materials such as PDMS and Ta2O5 in air/water and silicone oil/water medium.},

  abstract = {The ability to manipulate a liquid meniscus using electrowetting has many applications. In any electrowetting design, at least two electrodes are required: one forms the field to change the contact angle and the other functions as a ground electrode. The contribution of the ground electrode (GE) to the dynamics of electrowetting has not yet been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we discovered that with a bare ground electrode, the contact angle of a sessile drop increases instead of decreases when a direct current (DC) voltage varying from zero to the threshold voltage is applied. This phenomenon is opposite to what occurs when the GE is coated with a dielectric, where the contact-angle change follows the Lippmann--Young equation above the threshold voltage of electrowetting. However, this behaviour is not observed with either a dielectric-coated electrode using direct current (DC) or a bare ground electrode using alternating current (AC) voltage electrowetting. This study explains this phenomenon with finite element simulation and theory. From previous research work, the ground electrode configuration is inconsistent. In some studies, the ground electrode is exposed to water; in other studies, the ground electrode is covered with dielectric. This study identified that an exposed ground electrode is not required in electrowetting. Moreover, this research work suggests that for applications where precise control of the contact angle is paramount, a dielectric-coated ground electrode should be used since it prevents the increase in the contact angle when increasing the applied potential from zero to the threshold voltage. This study also identified that contact angle hysteresis is lower with a Cytop-coated ground electrode and DC voltage than with a bare ground electrode using AC or DC voltages.},

A DMF device is a liquid-droplets-handling platform with varied applications in the fields of medical diagnostics, drug discovery, chemical analysis, environmental monitoring, and basic scientific research. These operations can be performed in a rapid, low-cost, portable, and reliable environment using DMF devices. Two of the important elements of DMF devices are electro-wetting on dielectric phenomenon and hydrophobicity. Under an applied voltage of either AC or DC, the electro-wetting effect induces a reduction in the contact angle of the droplet with the hydrophobic surface. This enables manipulation of motion and position of droplets on the hydrophobic surface. In this work, the actuation of droplets on an open DMF device with a single array of electrodes is carried out. The fabrication of DMF plate is carried out on a copper covered plate by patterning using black tapes and etching using etchants. The circuit is arranged using PCB, jumper wires, 8-channel relay, 9V battery, acpower regulator and a microcontroller (Arduino/Genuino UNO).},

  abstract = {Abstract             Characterizing the thermal behavior of dispersed droplets within microfluidic channels is crucial for different applications in lab-on-a-chip. In this paper, the physics of droplets volume during their transport over a heater is studied experimentally and numerically. The response of droplets to external heating is examined at temperature ranges of 25--90\,{$^\circ$}C and at different flow rates of the dispersed phase respect to the continuous flow. The results present a reliable prediction of the droplet volume and stability when heating is applied to the droplets at the downstream channel in a quite far distance from the droplets' ejection orifice. Increasing the ratio of flow rate resulted in larger droplets; for instance, the flow ratio of 0.25 produced drops with 40\% larger diameter than the flow rate of 0.1. For every 10\,{$^\circ$}C increase in temperature of the droplets, the droplet diameter increased by about 5.7\% and 4.2\% for pure oil and oil with a surfactant, respectively. Also, the droplets showed a degree of instability during their transport over the heater at higher temperatures. Adding SPAN 20 surfactant improved the stability of the droplets at temperatures higher than 60\,{$^\circ$}C. The experimentally validated numerical model helped for systemic analysis of the influence of key temperature-dependence parameters (e.g. surface tension, density and viscosity of both phases) on controlling the volume and stability of droplets. Our findings supported to develop highly functional systems with a predetermined droplets performance under high temperatures up to 90\,{$^\circ$}C. This report provides a preliminary basis for enhancing the performance of droplet microfluidic systems for digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR), continuous flow digital loop-mediated isothermal PCR (LAMP), and droplet-based antibiotic susceptibility testing.},

Droplets generated in microfluidics can perform multiple functions by either changing the reaction conditions within each droplet or doing the same reactions in parallel, series, or combinations. These reactions mostly require precise control of droplet temperature using contact or non-contact heating sources, including optical-, electrical-, mechanical- and acoustic-based heating techniques.

The chemical applications include synthesis of microgel droplets and Janus particles. The engineering applications include an overview of thermal manipulation of the generated droplets and employing emulsified droplets in thermal management and cooling applications.

However, notably, much of the research into molecular self-assembly has been performed using conventional bulk techniques where the resultant species are dictated by thermodynamic stability to yield relatively simple assemblies. Whereas, the environmental control offered by microfluidic systems offers methods to achieve non-equilibrium reaction conditions capable of increasingly sophisticated self-assembled structures. Alterations to the immediate microenvironment during the assembly of the molecules is possible, providing the basis for kinetically-controlled assembly. This review examines the key mechanism offered by microfluidic systems and the architectures required to access them. The mechanisms include diffusion-led mixing, shear gradient alignment, spatial and temporal confinement, and structural templates in multiphase systems.

This portable and miniaturized analytical system was operated automatically by computerized control switching of solenoid valves. Under the optimum operational condition, a linear calibration graph of phosphate and ammonium (as phosphorus, P, and nitrogen, N) in the range of 0.2--3.0 mg P L-1 and 0.3--4.0 mg N L-1, were achieved with a sample-throughput of 12 h-1. Limit of detection values for phosphate and ammonium were 0.18 and 0.27 mg L-1, respectively. The developed system provides a good precision with relative standard deviations of 2.9 and 4.1\% for 11 replicated injections of 1 mg P L-1 and 2 mg N L-1, respectively. Percent recoveries of the analysis of phosphate and ammonium were obtained in the range of 93.5--109.4 and 92.4--107.0, respectively.

To address this limitation, we are developing a digital microfluidic (DMF) platform to function as a fluid distribution hub, enabling the integration of multiple subsystem modules into an automated NGS library sample preparation system. A novel capillary interface enables highly repeatable transfer of liquid between the DMF device and the external fluidic modules, allowing both continuous-flow and droplet-based sample manipulations to be performed in one integrated system. Here, we highlight the utility of the DMF hub platform and capillary interface for automating two key operations in the NGS sample preparation workflow. Using an in-line contactless conductivity detector in conjunction with the capillary interface, we demonstrate closed-loop automated fraction collection of target analytes from a continuous-flow sample stream into droplets on the DMF device. Buffer exchange and sample cleanup, the most repeated steps in NGS library preparation, are also demonstrated on the DMF platform using a magnetic bead assay and achieving an average DNA recovery efficiency of 80\% {\textpm} 4.8\%.},

However, soft sensors made of polymer materials have inherent limitations of hysteresis and nonlinearity in response, which makes it highly difficult to implement traditional calibration techniques and yields poor estimation performance. In this paper, we propose intelligent algorithms based on machine learning and logics that can improve the performance of soft sensors. The proposed methods in this paper could be solutions to the aforementioned long-standing problems. They can also be used to simplify the system complexity by reducing the number of signal wires. Three machine learning techniques are discussed in this paper: an artificial neural network (ANN), the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm, and a recurrent neural network (RNN). The Preisach model of hysteresis and simple logics were used to support these algorithms. We proved that classifying contact locations on a soft sensor is possible using simple algorithms in real time. Also, force estimation of a single contact was possible using an ANN with the Preisach method. Finally, we successfully estimated forces of multiple contact locations by predicting the outputs of mixed RNN results.},

To separate and concentrate the cells from the sample, superparamagnetic particles and a microfluidic chip were used. A portable fluorometer was developed to measure the fluorescence signal from the quantum dot nanoparticles attached to Salmonella in the samples. The sensitivity for detection of pathogenic Salmonella was evaluated using serially diluted Salmonella Typhimurium in borate buffer and chicken extract. The fluorescence response of the nano-biosensor increased with increasing cell concentration. The detection limit of the sensor was 103 CFU/mL Salmonella in both borate buffer and food extract.},

Microfluidic lab-on-a-chip systems can offer cost- and time-efficient alternatives to advance microalgal biofuel and bioproduction research by providing high precision and high efficiency cell/reagent handling capabilities, enabling high-throughput assays in a fully automated fashion. Here, we review recent advances in the development and application of microfluidic lab-on-a-chip systems for microalgal biotechnology, especially microalgae-based biofuels, including microsystems for single-cell resolution high-throughput cell identification and separation, highly efficient cell transformation, high-throughput parallel cell cultivation, cell harvesting, and cell analysis applications.

Identifying the latest trends in single-cell trapping technologies afford opportunities such as new structural design and combination with other technologies. This will lead to more advanced applications towards improving measurement sensitivity to the desired target.

Since droplets are manipulated individually and act as discrete microreactors, DMF is well suited for microscale sample processing. Coupling the versatility of MS analysis with DMF sample handling has been beneficial for a number of DMF-based applications, including proteomics, chemical synthesis, and clinical diagnostics. In this review, we provide a summary of efforts to integrate these two technologies, focusing on examples of both off-line and in-line MS analysis for DMF sample processing.},

  abstract = {The opportunity for the commercialization of microfluidic systems has surged over the recent decade, primarily for medical and the life science applications. This positive development has been spurred by an increasing number of integrated, highly functional lab-on-a-chip technologies from the research community. Toward commercialization, there is a dire need for economic manufacture which involves optimized cost for materials and structuring on the front-end as well as for a range of back-end processing steps such as surface modification, integration of functional elements, assembly and packaging. Front-end processing can readily resort to very well established polymer mass fabrication schemes, e.g. injection molding. Also assembly and packaging can often be adopted from commercially available processes. In this review, we survey the back-end processes of hybrid material integration and surface modification which often need to be tailored to the specifics of miniaturized polymeric microfluidic systems. On the one hand, the accurate control of these back-end processes proves to be the key to the technical function of the system and thus the value creation. On the other hand, the integration of functional materials constitutes a major cost factor.},

Absolute quantification by ddPCR was then further developed to identify E. coli O157:H7 and S. Typhimurium targeting the single copy genes Z3276 and invA, respectively. Apple juice, milk and chicken were selected as corresponding represents of fruit, dairy and meat, to investigate the application of ddPCR in different food.

When detecting the genes Z3276 and invA simultaneously by dual channels using ddPCR, the detection limit of E. coli O157:H7 and S.

Here, we propose a method for selective control of individual droplets, which allows different conditions for individual droplet pairs. Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) technology is introduced to control the height of the droplets so that the contact between droplet-pairs can be individually controlled. Circular patterns 4~mm in diameter composed of electrodes for EWOD and hydrophilic--hydrophobic patterns for droplet formation 4~{$\mu$}l in volume were developed. We demonstrate the selective control of the droplet height by EWOD for an applied voltage up to 160~V and selective control of the contact and transport of substances. Presented results will provide useful method for advanced drug screening, including cell-based screening.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting-on-dielectric is a decent technique to manipulate discrete volumes of liquid in form of droplets. In the last decade, electrowetting-on-dielectric systems, also called digital microfluidic systems, became more frequently used for a variety of applications because of their high flexibility and reconfigurability. Thus, one design can be adapted to different assays by only reprogramming. However, this flexibility can only be useful if the entire system is portable and easy to use. This paper presents the development of a portable, standalone digital microfluidic system based on a Linux-based operating system running on a Raspberry Pi, which is unique. We present ``PortaDrop'' exhibiting the following key features: (1) an ``all-in-one box'' approach, (2) a user-friendly, self-explaining graphical user interface and easy handling, (3) the ability of integrated electrochemical measurements, (4) the ease to implement additional lab equipment via Universal Serial Bus and the General Purpose Interface Bus as well as (5) a standardized experiment documentation. We propose that PortaDrop can be used to carry out experiments in different applications, where small sample volumes in the nanoliter to picoliter range need to be handled an analyzed automatically. As a first application, we present a protocol, where a droplet is consequently exchanged by droplets of another medium using passive dispensing. The exchange is monitored by electrical impedance spectroscopy. It is the first time, the media exchange caused by passive dispensing is characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Summarizing, PortaDrop allows easy combination of fluid handling by means of electrowetting and additional sensing.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a protocol using theoretical methods and free software to design and analyze multivolume digital PCR (MV digital PCR) devices; the theory and software are also applicable to design and analysis of dilution series in digital PCR. MV digital PCR minimizes the total number of wells required for ``digital'' (single molecule) measurements while maintaining high dynamic range and high resolution. In some examples, multivolume designs with fewer than 200 total wells are predicted to provide dynamic range with 5-fold resolution similar to that of single-volume designs requiring 12 000 wells. Mathematical techniques were utilized and expanded to maximize the information obtained from each experiment and to quantify performance of devices and were experimentally validated using the SlipChip platform. MV digital PCR was demonstrated to perform reliably, and results from wells of different volumes agreed with one another. No artifacts due to different surface-to-volume ratios were observed, and single molecule amplification in volumes ranging from 1 to 125 nL was self-consistent. The device presented here was designed to meet the testing requirements for measuring clinically relevant levels of HIV viral load at the point-of-care (in plasma, {$<$}500 molecules/mL to {$>$}1 000 000 molecules/ mL), and the predicted resolution and dynamic range was experimentally validated using a control sequence of DNA. This approach simplifies digital PCR experiments, saves space, and thus enables multiplexing using separate areas for each sample on one chip, and facilitates the development of new high-performance diagnostic tools for resource-limited applications. The theory and software presented here are general and are applicable to designing and analyzing other digital analytical platforms including digital immunoassays and digital bacterial analysis. It is not limited to SlipChip and could also be useful for the design of systems on platforms including valve-based and droplet-based platforms. In a separate publication by Shen et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2011, DOI: 10.1021/ja2060116), this approach is used to design and test digital RT-PCR devices for quantifying RNA.},

This assay platform combines two digital approaches. First, digital microfluidic manipulation of droplets which serve as micro-reaction chambers and shuttling magnetic particles between these droplets facilitates the integration of complex solid phase multistep assays. We demonstrate an optimized novel particle extraction and transfer protocol for superparamagnetic particles on a digital microfluidic chip that allows for nearly 100\% extraction efficiencies securing high assay performance. Second, the compartmentalization required for digital single molecule detection is solved by simple molecular biological means, circumventing the need for complex microfabrication procedures necessary for most, if not all, other digital nucleic acid detection methods. For that purpose, padlock probes are circularized in a strictly target dependent ligation reaction and amplified through two rounds of rolling circle amplification, including an intermediate digestion step. The reaction results in hundreds of 500 nm sized individually countable DNA nanospheres per detected target molecule. We demonstrate that integrated miniaturized digital microfluidic C2CA results in equally high numbers of C2CA products {$\mu$}L               -1               as off-chip tube control experiments indicating high assay performance without signal loss.

Herein, the application of microfluidic devices for nucleic acid amplification has recently been extensively and vigorously studied and implemented. However, the existing classical instruments are hefty, excessive thermal loss, more power consumption, laborious, and require more execution time. Further, it is hard to establish a platform to integrate, automate, and miniaturize the microdevice on a solo stage for testing and analyzing. There has been substantial innovation in the development of continuous-flow based microfluidic PCR micro-devices in the last few decades because of their widespread applications.

  abstract = {Using pathogen-infected food that can be unhygienic can result in severe diseases and an increase in mortality rate among humans. This may arise as a serious emergency problem if not appropriately restricted at this point of time. Thus, food science researchers are concerned with precaution, prevention, perception, and immunity to pathogenic bacteria. Expensive, elongated assessment time and the need for skilled personnel are some of the shortcomings of the existing conventional methods. Developing and investigating a rapid, low-cost, handy, miniature, and effective detection technology for pathogens is indispensable. In recent times, there has been a significant scope of interest for microfluidics-based three-electrode potentiostat sensing platforms, which have been extensively used for sustainable food safety exploration because of their progressively high selectivity and sensitivity. Meticulously, scholars have made noteworthy revolutions in signal enrichment tactics, measurable devices, and portable tools, which can be used as an allusion to food safety investigation. Additionally, a device for this purpose must incorporate simplistic working conditions, automation, and miniaturization. In order to meet the critical needs of food safety for on-site detection of pathogens, point-of-care testing (POCT) has to be introduced and integrated with microfluidic technology and electrochemical biosensors. This review critically discusses the recent literature, classification, difficulties, applications, and future directions of microfluidics-based electrochemical sensors for screening and detecting foodborne pathogens.},

All these phenomena are affected by the energy exchange between the impacting droplet and the surface. In the present work, an electrowetting technique is implemented to change the droplet interaction with the surface. The droplet impact on hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surfaces combined with alternating current electrowetting on dielectric (AC EWOD) has been numerically investigated. Droplet impact characteristics have been studied for various voltage amplitudes, frequencies, and surface hydrophobicities. These factors strongly affect the droplet dynamics of the impacting droplet. An increase in voltage amplitude enhances the maximum spreading of the impacting droplet. In contrast, it reduces the recoiling rate of the droplet, resulting in partial or complete sup\- pression of the droplet rebound. At a particular voltage amplitude, frequency and hydrophobicity of the surface affect the droplet rebound suppression. Complete rebound suppression has been observed at higher voltage amplitudes and the medium range of frequencies (25--50 Hz). The contact time of the droplet decreases with the increase in surface hydrophobicity at all frequencies, whereas it increases with the voltage amplitude. Contact line velocity and velocity inside the droplet manifest the inertia of the droplet. The droplet is unable to rebound if velocities are very low.},

Existing mixing algorithms determine the mixing tree or mixing graph from a given target ratio of several biochemical fluids for on-chip mixture preparation. We present an algorithm to determine a reduced mixing tree by sharing the common subtrees within itself. We observe two transformations that preserve the semantics of the tree: (a) permutation of leaf nodes (input fluids/reagents) within the same level of a mixing tree, and (b) level-shifting of a leaf node to the next lower level by duplicating its appearance. The proposed algorithm utilizes both the intermediate droplets obtained after a split operation when a pair of identical subtrees are identified under permutation of leaf nodes at the same level. Simulation results for a large set of target ratios show that our algorithm reduces the mean values of the total number of mix-split steps, waste droplets and the number of mixer modules required for earliest completion by 16\%, 29\% and 12\% over Min-Mix and by 22\%, 34\% and 20\% over RMA, respectively. Moreover, it reduces the number of checkpoint insertions required for dynamic error recovery against incorrect mix-split steps during mixture preparation.},

  abstract = {Microfluidic paper-based analytical devices ({$\mu$}PADs) have experienced rapid growth over the past decade due to their simple design, low cost, minimal sample requirement, and good sensitivity, selectivity and accuracy. While designed originally for point-of-care medical diagnostics, biological, and food safety applications, {$\mu$}PADs are now used increasingly for environmental monitoring purposes. This review provides a detailed overview of the {$\mu$}PADs developed over the past ten years for the environmental analysis of soil, air, ecology (pesticides) and river water. The review commences by introducing the fabrication techniques and detection methods used in {$\mu$}PAD technology. A detailed description of the main {$\mu$}PAD frameworks proposed in the past decade for environmental monitoring is then provided.

  abstract = {Generating controlled vortices in a sessile surface droplet configuration in an energy efficient manner is an outstanding research problem of interdisciplinary relevance, having implications in widely varying areas ranging from biomedical diagnostics, thermal management to digital microfluidic technology. Here, we experimentally and theoretically demonstrate a simple yet energy efficient strategy for generating controlled vortices inside a surface droplet, by deploying interacting electrical and thermal fields over inter-digitated electrodes on an electrically wetted platform. Unlike the traditional electrically driven mechanisms, this strategy involves significantly low voltage ({$\leq$}10 V) to induce rotational structures inside the droplet, by exploiting the strong spatial gradient of electrical properties on account of the prevailing thermal field as attributable to intrinsically induced Joule heating effects. Our experiments demonstrate that fluid velocities typically of the order of mm/s can be generated inside the droplet within the standard regimes of operating parameters, bearing far-reaching consequences towards enhancing internal mixing in multifarious droplet based microfluidic applications. An inherent integrability with the existing electrowetting on dielectric platforms renders the process ideal to be used in conjunction with digital microfluidic technology.},

  abstract = {Heavy metal pollution of water has become a global issue and is especially problematic in some developing countries. Heavy metals are toxic to living organisms, even at very low concentrations. Therefore, effective and reliable heavy metal detection in environmental water is very important. Current laboratory-based methods used for analysis of heavy metals in water require sophisticated instrumentation and highly trained technicians, making them unsuitable for routine heavy metal monitoring in the environment. Consequently, there is a growing demand for autonomous detection systems that could perform in situ or point-of-use measurements. Microfluidic detection systems, which are defined by their small size, have many characteristics that make them suitable for environmental analysis. Some of these advantages include portability, high sample throughput, reduced reagent consumption and waste generation, and reduced production cost. This review focusses on developments in the application of microfluidic detection systems to heavy metal detection in water. Microfluidic detection strategies based on optical techniques, electrochemical techniques, and quartz crystal microbalance are discussed.},

This format provides the opportunity to tune the amount (and potentially the type) of stationary phase on-the-fly, and allows the removal of beads after the extraction (to enable other operations in same device-space), maintaining device reconfigurability. Using the new method, we employed a design of experiments (DOE) operation to enable automated on-chip optimization of elution solvent composition for reversed phase SPE of a model system. Further, conditions were selected to enable on-chip fractionation of multiple analytes. Finally, the method was demonstrated to be useful for online cleanup of extracts from dried blood spot (DBS) samples. We anticipate this combination of features will prove useful for separating a wide range of analytes, from small molecules to peptides, from complex matrices.},

Digital microfluidics, a microscale liquid-handling technique, characterized by the manipulation of discrete droplets on open electrode arrays, offers a potential solution to these problems. Results: We report a new digital microfluidic method for multiplexed extraction and analysis of pharmaceuticals in DBS samples. In the new method, four DBS samples are extracted in microliter-sized droplets containing internal standard, and the extract is delivered to dedicated nanoelectrospray ionization emitters for direct analysis by tandem mass spectometry and selected reaction monitoring. Conclusion: The new method allows for an order of magnitude reduction in processing time and approximately three-times reduction in extraction solvent relative to conventional techniques, while maintaining acceptable analytical performance for most drugs tested.},

Furthermore, the droplet location map and reaction behaviors are visible on a 2-dimentional (2D) graphical user-interface due to the micro electrode dot array (MEDA) architecture and capacitive sensing technology, and hence system automation is achievable. Fabricated in standard 0.35 {$\mu$}m CMOS process, this work integrates 900 microelectrodes with measurement window in 3.2 mm2, where the high sensitivity capacitive readout circuit occupies only 0.048 mm2. Measurement results show that microdroplet actuation and 2D location map are activated under 1KHz.

  abstract = {Single-cell analysis techniques have been developed as a valuable bioanalytical tool for elucidating cellular heterogeneity at genomic, proteomic, and cellular levels. Cell manipulation is an indispensable process for single-cell analysis. Digital microfluidics (DMF) is an important platform for conducting cell manipulation and single-cell analysis in a high-throughput fashion. However, the manipulation of single cells in DMF has not been quantitatively studied so far. In this article, we investigate the interaction of a single microparticle with a liquid droplet on a flat substrate using numerical simulations. The droplet is driven by capillary force generated from the wettability gradient of the substrate. Considering the Brownian motion of microparticles, we utilize many-body dissipative particle dynamics (MDPD), an off-lattice mesoscopic simulation technique, in this numerical study. The manipulation processes (including pickup, transport, and drop-off) of a single microparticle with a liquid droplet are simulated. Parametric studies are conducted to investigate the effects on the manipulation processes from the droplet size, wettability gradient, wetting properties of the microparticle, and particle-substrate friction coefficients. The numerical results show that the pickup, transport, and drop-off processes can be precisely controlled by these parameters. On the basis of the numerical results, a trap-free delivery of a hydrophobic microparticle to a destination on the substrate is demonstrated in the numerical simulations. The numerical results not only provide a fundamental understanding of interactions among the microparticle, the droplet, and the substrate but also demonstrate a new technique for the trap-free immobilization of single hydrophobic microparticles in the DMF design. Finally, our numerical method also provides a powerful design and optimization tool for the manipulation of microparticles in DMF systems.},

However, the complex and nonlinear behavior of multiphase microfluidic devices and several parameters affecting droplet size simultaneously necessitates costly design iterations to generate droplets with the radius of interest for a certain application. To address this, we exploit soft computing methods to bridge fuzzy systems and neural networks in order to build an adaptive neural-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) that predicts the droplet size generated in a flow-focusing microfluidic device based on six major parameters, that includes geometry, flow, and fluid properties. This model shows a significant accuracy with a coefficient of determination of 0.96 when compared to the observed data points. Once the ANFIS model is built and verified, we use it to study the effect of each input parameter on droplet size which is challenging and/or expensive to determine experimentally.},

In this contribution, a microfluidic platform, combining the actuation principle of electrowetting on dielectrics for droplet manipulations and the sensor principle of impedance spectroscopy for the characterization of the fluid composition and condition, is presented. The fabrication process of the microfluidic platform comprises physical vapor deposition and structuring of the metal electrodes onto a substrate, the deposition of a dielectric isolator and a hydrophobic top coating. The key advantage of this microfluidic chip is the common electric nature of the sensor and the actuation principle. This allows for fabricating digital microfluidic devices with a minimal number of process steps. Multiple measurements on fluids of different composition (including rigid particles) and of different conditions (temperature, sedimentation) were performed and process parameters were monitored online.

  abstract = {This paper presents a study on a method for efficiently manipulating droplets on a two-dimensional (2-D) plane using only a limited number of electrodes by employing the asymmetric oscillation characteristic of droplets actuated by electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) at low frequencies. In this study, the droplets actuated by lowfrequency EWOD were found to oscillate repeating asymmetric expansion and recession, while at the same time wetting on the surface of electrodes. Using the EWOD electrodes in the coplanar design fabricated through the MEMS process, the dynamic behaviors of asymmetrically oscillating droplets with different viscosities and their horizontal transportations caused by the oscillation were investigated by high-speed images. Then, an analysis was made of the changes in droplet radius, position, and contact angle as a function of frequency that applied during the EWOD actuation, in order to confirm that the droplets transported horizontally in the vicinity of the resonance frequency at which the droplets were more increasingly inclined to exhibit asymmetric oscillation. Furthermore, another study was performed to demonstrate droplet transference in conjunction with droplet transportation. In this study, the droplets transporting horizontally under the influence of low-frequency EWOD actuation were transferred to the adjacent electrodes spaced at regular gaps. The results were used to determine the spacing of the electrodes that allowed the transference of the droplets and the threshold voltage required for the transference. Lastly, as proof of concept, the manipulation of two 4 {$\mu$}L droplets was successfully demon\- strated on a 7.5 {\texttimes} 3 cm2 transparent chip using only seven patterned electrodes.},

  abstract = {A sudden increase of algae and their associated toxins in aquatic ecosystems can detrimentally affect the quality of the water, causing serious socio-economic and public health problems. To prevent the spread of harmful algae in aquatic ecosystems, it is essential to track the water's quality through rapid and in-situ monitoring systems. Conventional methods of algae quantification such as microscopy, hemocytometry, and UV--vis spectroscopy, however, are often unsuitable or inconvenient for in-situ assessment as they require skilled labor and expensive equipment. In this study, we developed a three-dimensional (3D)-printed smartphone platform integrated with a light-driven microfluidic chip operated by optoelectrowetting (OEW). This OEW-driven microfluidic chip not only allows multiplexed drop-wise functions such as droplet transportation, merging, mixing, immobilization on a detection zone, for on-chip water sample preparation but also fluorescent detection and counting of target algae cells using a commercially-available smartphone. Two freshwater algae (C. reinhardtii and M. aeruginosa) and two marine water algae (Amphiprora sp and C. closterium) were employed to validate the 3D-printed smartphone platform in this study. The fluorescence images of viable algae and the cell counting from the microfluidic chip were comparable to the results from a hemocytometer (P {$>$} 0.05). We have further conducted tests with spiked samples using freshwater and marine water that were directly collected from environmental samples, showing the same order of magnitude of cell numbers in the spiked and control cultures of algae cells (106 cell/mL, P {$>$} 0.05). Unlike traditional quantification methods, the 3D-printed smartphone platform integrated with the OEW offers a highly portable, user-friendly, low-cost tool that enables simple on-chip sample preparation and detection of viable algae. Thus, this stand-alone technology has the potential for rapid and insitu monitoring of water quality, while using the smartphone's wireless communication capabilities to report the quality of the water in real-time.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with electrowetting (EW) and electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) principles applied to micro{\textasciimacron}uidic devices. EW and EWOD are principles that can control wettability of liquids on solid surfaces using electric potential. While EW is controlling wettability of a certain electrolyte on a metal electrode by varying electric energy across the electrical double layer (EDL), EWOD applies to virtually any aqueous liquid by varying electric energy across the thin dielectric {\textregistered}lm between the liquid and conducting substrate. These driving mechanisms have many advantages. By electrically changing the wettability of each of the electrode patterns on a surface, a liquid on these electrodes can be shaped and driven along the active electrodes, making micro{\textasciimacron}uidics extremely simple both for device fabrication and operation. It is also worth noting that, driven by surface tension, the mechanism becomes more effective as the size of the device becomes smaller. This paper describes fundamental concepts and the proof-of-concept experiments, modeling and design, microfabrication processes, and initial testing results for the micro{\textasciimacron}uidic devices based on the EW and EWOD principles. \# 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this study, electrowetting actuations with square pulse signals are employed to detach droplets from a hydrophobic surface. The threshold voltage for droplet detachment is obtained both experimentally and theoretically to find that it is almost constant for various droplet volumes ranging from 0.4 to 10 {$\mu$}L. It is also found that droplets can be detached more easily when the width of applied pulse is well-matched to the spreading time (i.e., the time to reach the maximum spread diameter). When the droplet is actuated by a double square pulse, the threshold voltage is reduced by {$\sim$}20\% from that for a single square pulse actuation. Finally, by introducing an interdigitated electrode system, it is demonstrated that droplets can be detached from the solid bottom surface without using a top needle electrode.},

These are categorized into several groups based on the principle applied: conventional culture methods, immunology-based assays, nucleic acid-based assays, miniaturized biochemical assays, and biosensors. Conventional culture methods serve as the basis in food testing laboratories despite rather laborious and time-consuming protocols. Considerable progress in rapid methods using emerging technologies yield faster answers and higher throughput of samples. This paper also shows and analyzes Salmonella test results and summarizes the features and limitations of the studies involving Salmonella detection methods developed for emergency response, mainly by food emergency response laboratories participating during recent fiscal years. The emergency response laboratories utilize Salmonella detection methods possessing properties that include simplicity, versatility, high sensitivity, good specificity, and cost efficiency. Collaboration of the food emergency response laboratories in the development of these technologies is important essentially to compare for the purpose of continually improving Salmonella detection methods.},

Liquid dielectrophoresis (L-DEP) has many advantages and exciting prospects in driving droplets. To fully realize the potential benefits of this technique, one must know the droplet volume accurately for its distribution and manipulation. Here we present an investigation of the tensile length of a droplet subjected to a L-DEP force with varied parameters to achieve precise control of the volume of a droplet. Liquid propylene carbonate served as a driving liquid in the L-DEP experiment. The chip was divided into two parts: an electrode of width fixed at 0.1 mm and a total width fixed at 1 mm. Each had a variation of six electrode spacings. The experimental results showed that the stretching length decreased with decreasing electrode width, but the stretching length did not vary with an increased spacing of the electrode. When the two electrodes were activated, the length decreased because of an increase in electrode spacing. The theory was based on the force balance on a droplet that involved the force generated by the electric field, friction force, and capillary force. The theory was improved according to the experimental results. To verify the theoretical improvement through the results, we designed a three-electrode chip for experiments. The results proved that the theory is consistent with the results of the experiments, so that the length of a droplet stretched with L-DEP and its volume can be calculated.},

For tracking the evolution of the free interface between two immiscible fluids, we employed the finite element method with the two-phase level set technique to solve the Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the energy equation. Both the upper wall and the bottom wall of the microchannel are set to be an ambient temperature. 40mW heat source is placed at the distance of 1 mm from the initial position of a water droplet. When the heat source is turned on, a pair of asymmetric thermocapillary convection vortices is formed inside the droplet and the thermocapillary on the receding side is smaller than that on the advancing side. The temperature gradient inside the droplet increases quickly at the initial times and then decreases versus time. Therefore, the actuation velocity of the water droplet first increases significantly, and then decreases continuously. The dynamic contact angle is strongly affected by the oil flow motion and the net thermocapillary momentum inside the droplet. The advancing contact angle is always larger than the receding contact angle during actuation process.},

Establishing a microfluidic chip with point-of-care capabilities, including actuation and annealing, has proven to be important. Unfortunately, poor heat absorption due to the long optical penetration depth of near infrared light creates scaling limitations for applications in optical-based microfluidics. Through the application of WGM, the interaction length between the droplet and light is increased beyond the droplet diameter to improve heating and optical absorption. This is supported by finite-difference time-domain electromagnetic simulations and experimental results showing a greatly improved temperature change. Such a system is implemented in an open system digital microfluidic chip, to facilitate annealing via side illumination of droplets. The open system digital microfluidic chip is programmable for droplet actuation. The fundamental experiment of preprogrammed actuation of microdroplets is demonstrated in a 36 electrode grid. The results of annealing and actuation show potential for implementation in point-of-care microfluidic devices.},

  abstract = {We present and investigate a novel application domain for deep reinforcement learning (RL): droplet routing on digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs). A DMFB, composed of a twodimensional electrode array, manipulates discrete fluid droplets to automatically execute biochemical protocols such as point-of-care clinical diagnosis. However, a major concern associated with the use of DMFBs is that electrodes in a biochip can degrade over time. Droplet-transportation operations associated with the degraded electrodes can fail, thereby compromising the integrity of the bioassay outcome. We show that casting droplet transportation as an RL problem enables the training of deep network policies to capture the underlying health conditions of electrodes and provide reliable fluidic operations. We propose a new RLbased droplet-routing flow that can be used for various sizes of DMFBs, and demonstrate reliable execution of an epigenetic bioassay with the RL droplet router on a fabricated DMFB. To facilitate further research, we also present a simulation environment based on the OpenAI Gym Interface for RL-guided droplet-routing problems on DMFBs.},

With driving voltages less than 15 V it is believed to be the lowest reported driving voltage for any material system compatible with post-processing on completed integrated circuits wafers. The process architecture uses anodically grown tantalum pentoxide as a pinhole free high dielectric constant insulator with an overlying 16 nm layer of Teflon-AF{\`O}, which provides the hydrophobic surface for droplets manipulation. This stack provides a very robust dielectric, which maintains a sufficiently high capacitance per unit area for effective operation at a reduced voltage (15 V) which is more compatible with standard CMOS technology. The paper demonstrates that the sputtered tantalum layer used for the electrodes and the formation of the insulating dielectric can readily be integrated with both aluminium and copper interconnect used in foundry CMOS. {\'O} 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

The EWOD technology made the once-obscure electrowetting phenomenon practical, leading to the host of commercial products today.           ,                             The emergence of electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) in the early 2000s made the once-obscure electrowetting phenomenon practical and led to numerous activities over the last two decades. As an eloquent microscale liquid handling technology that gave birth to digital microfluidics, EWOD has served as the basis for many commercial products over two major application areas: optical, such as liquid lenses and reflective displays, and biomedical, such as DNA library preparation and molecular diagnostics. A number of research or start-up companies (               e.g.               , Phillips Research, Varioptic, Liquavista, and Advanced Liquid Logic) led the early commercialization efforts and eventually attracted major companies from various industry sectors (               e.g.               , Corning, Amazon, and Illumina). Although not all of the pioneering products became an instant success, the persistent growth of liquid lenses and the recent FDA approvals of biomedical analyzers proved that EWOD is a powerful tool that deserves a wider recognition and more aggressive exploration. This review presents the history around major EWOD products that hit the market to show their winding paths to commercialization and summarizes the current state of product development to peek into the future. In providing the readers with a big picture of commercializing EWOD and digital microfluidics technology, our goal is to inspire further research exploration and new entrepreneurial adventures.},

Here, a method is proposed for decreasing the saturated contact angle by controlling the behavior of charge trapping at the liquid--solid interface. An unexpected phenomenon is uncovered: for a short time the contact angle reaches smaller values before it retreats to its saturation value, which is caused by charge trapping at the liquid--solid interface. Experimental results suggest that the trapped charges can be repeatedly detrapped and retrapped when the polarity of the applied voltage is periodically reversed, which results in contact angles retreating periodically. By applying a well-modulated voltage signal with reversing polarity, the retreat movement of the contact angle can be controlled to obtain a value significantly smaller than the previously possible threshold. As a specific application of this method, an economic two-step process which is developed potentially suitable for mass-producing large-area flexible microlens arrays with controllable curvatures and wide fields of view.},

In recent years, DMFBs based on a microelectrode-dot-array (MEDA) architecture have been proposed. MEDA biochips can provide advantages of better capability of droplet manipulation and real-time sensing ability. However, errors are likely to occur due to defects, chip degradation, and the lack of precision inherent in biochemical experiments. Therefore, an efficient error-recovery strategy is essential to ensure the correctness of assays executed on MEDA biochips. By exploiting MEDA-specific advances in droplet sensing, we present a novel error-recovery technique to dynamically reconfigure the biochip using real-time data provided by on-chip sensors. Local recovery strategies based on probabilistic-timed-automata are presented for various types of errors. An on-line synthesis technique and a control flow are also proposed to connect localrecovery procedures with global error recovery for the complete bioassay. Moreover, an integer linear programming (ILP)-based method is also proposed to select the optimal local-recovery time for each operation. Laboratory experiments using a fabricated MEDA chip are used to characterize the outcomes of key droplet operations. The PRISM model checker and three benchmarks are used for an extensive set of simulations. Our results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed error-recovery strategy.},

This paper presents the influence of relative humidity on the finger-surface friction force and the electroadhesion performance. Mechanisms including changes to Young's modulus of skin, contact angle change and capillary force were analyzed separately with experimental and numerical methods. Through comparison of the calculated capillary force in this paper and the electroadhesion force calculated in published papers, it was found that electrowetting at high voltage could contribute up to 60\% of the total friction force increase in electroadhesion. Therefore, in future design of surface haptic devices, the effect of electrowetting should be considered carefully.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting is an elegant method to realize the motion, dispensing, splitting, and mixing of single droplets in a microfluidic system without the need for any mechanical---and fault-prone---components. By only applying an electric voltage, the interfacial energy of the fluid--solid interface is altered and the contact line of the droplet is changed. However, since the droplet shape is usually heavily distorted, it is difficult to estimate the droplet shape during the process. Further, it is often necessary to know if a process, e.g., droplet splitting on a given geometry, is possible at all, and what can be done to increase the system's reliability. It is thus important to use computer simulations to gain an understanding about the behavior of a droplet for a given electrode geometry and voltage curve. Special care must be exercised when considering surface-tension effects. We present computer simulations done with the Surface Evolver program and a template library combined with a graphical user interface (GUI) that facilitates standard tasks in the simulation of electrowetting arrays.},

Like the development of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology (the standard technique for NAT), the detection signal of fully integrated NAT devices has evolved from qualitative to quantitative and recently to digital readout, aiming at expanding their extensive applications through gradually improving detection sensitivity and accuracy. This review firstly introduces the existing commercial products, and then illustrates recent fully integrated micro\- fluidic devices for NAT at POC from the aspect of detection signals (i.e., qualitative, quantitative and digital). Importantly, the key issues of existing commercial products and the main challenges between scientific research and product development are discussed.

  abstract = {A digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) is an attractive technology platform for automating laboratory procedures in biochemistry. However, today's DMFBs suffer from several limitations: (i) constraints on droplet size and the inability to vary droplet volume in a fine-grained manner; (ii) the lack of integrated sensors for real-time detection; (iii) the need for special fabrication processes and reliability/yield concerns. To overcome the above problems, DMFBs based on a micro-electrode-dot-array (MEDA) architecture have recently been demonstrated. However, due to the inherent differences between today's DMFBs and MEDA, existing synthesis solutions cannot be utilized for MEDA-based biochips. We present the first biochip synthesis approach that can be used for MEDA. The proposed synthesis method targets operation scheduling, module placement, routing of droplets of various sizes, and diagonal movement of droplets in a two-dimensional array. Simulation results using benchmarks and experimental results using a fabricated MEDA biochip demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed co-optimization technique.},

  abstract = {Multilayer interconnections are needed for microdevices with a large number of independent electrodes. A multi-level photolithographic process is commonly employed to provide multilayer interconnections in integrated circuit devices, but it is often too expensive for large-area or disposable devices frequently needed for microfluidics. The printed circuit board (PCB) can provide multilayer interconnection at low cost, but its rough topography poses a challenge for small droplets to slide over. Here we report a low-cost fabrication of low-topography multilayer interconnects by selective and controlled anodization of thin-film metal layers. The process utilizes anodization of metal (tantalum in this paper) or, more specifically, repetitions of a partial anodization to form insulation layers between conductive layers and a full anodization to form isolating regions between electrodes, replacing the usual process of depositing, planarizing, and etching insulation layers. After verifying the electric connections and insulations as intended, the developed method is applied to electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD), whose complex microfluidic products are currently built on PCB or thin-film transistor substrates. To demonstrate the utility, we fabricate a three metal-layer EWOD device with steps (surface topography) less than 1 micrometer (vs. {$>$} 10 micrometers of PCB EWOD devices) and confirm basic digital microfluidic operations.},

It is urgently necessary to develop rapid, convenient, and cost-effective pointof-care testing (POCT) technologies for the early diagnosis and control of the plague's transmission. Developing POCT methods and related devices is critical for achieving point-of-care diagnosis. With the advantages of miniaturization, high throughput, small sample requirements, and low actual consumption, microfluidics is an essential technology for the development of POCT devices. In this review, according to the different driving forces of the fluid, we introduce the common POCT devices based on microfluidic technology on the market, including paper-based microfluidic, centrifugal microfluidic, optical fluid, and digital microfluidic platforms. Furthermore, various microfluidicbased assays for diagnosing COVID-19 are summarized, including immunoassays, such as ELISA, and molecular assays, such as PCR. Finally, the challenges of and future perspectives on microfluidic device design and development are presented. The ultimate goals of this paper are to provide new insights and directions for the development of microfluidic diagnostics while expecting to contribute to the control of COVID-19.},

Users can execute the experiments on biochips with high resolution, and the biochips market therefore grows significantly. However, malicious attackers exploit Intellectual Property (IP) piracy and Trojan attacks to gain illegal profits. The conventional approaches present defense mechanisms that target either IP piracy or Trojan attacks. In practical, DMFBs may suffer from the threat of being attacked by these two attacks at the same time. This paper presents a comprehensive security system to protect DMFBs from IP piracy and Trojan attacks. We propose an authentication mechanism to protect IP and detect errors caused by Trojans with CCD cameras. By our security system, we could generate secret keys for authentication and determine whether the bioassay is under the IP piracy and Trojan attacks. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our security system without overhead of the bioassay completion time.},

We present in this paper the first design automation flow that considers the crosscontamination problems on pin-constrained biochips. We explore the factors that make the problems harder on pin-constrained biochips. To cope with these cross contaminations, we propose (1) early crossing minimization algorithms during placement, and (2) systematic wash droplet scheduling and routing that require only one extra control pin and zero assay completion time overhead for practical bioassays.

The droplets, containing DNA, a ligation enzyme and a multi-salt reaction buffer, served to complete the ligation using a developed EWOD system. In order to reduce the effect from environment, so the concept of core-shell droplet was used in this study. Droplets of ultramicro volume (0.3{$\mu$}L) were successfully generated from reservoirs between one plate with coplanar electrodes and another plate with a hydrophobic surface free of electrodes. In one successful cloning, the total usage of reagents in an ultramicro-volume EWOD chip was 2.1{$\mu$}L; no volume was wasted, in comparison with 85\% waste with the standard protocol (15{$\mu$}L). The results also show that the four parallel DNA ligation processes were accomplished without damage to the chip surface and without biomaterial annulment.},

By altering the frequency of the applied voltage and the surrounding medium of a EWOD device, we found that when using oil as surrounding medium and applying an AC signal 100 kHz, liquid column would be drawn and follow the thin connecting lines of the EWOD driving electrodes instead of remaining on top of the center of the EWOD driving electrodes. This new phenomenon is described in this paper and is regarded as a LDEP effect. Three fundamental tools for integrated digital and analog microfluidics are developed, including a digital-to-analog converter, an analog-to-digital converter, and a valve. Combining EWOD and LDEP effects, liquids can be pumped on a virtual channel (analog microfluidics), defined by energized thin LDEP electrode lines, continuously from liquid reservoir or from a digitized droplet (digital microfluidics). On the contrary, liquids on LDEP electrodes (analog microfluidics) can also be pumped on a EWOD electrode and be digitized in droplet forms with precise volumes (digital microfluidics). EWOD and LDEP can be selectively programmed on a single chip, making integrated digital and analog microfluidics a reality.},

EWD devices were fabricated with a multilayer insulator consisting of 135 nm sputtered tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) and 180 nm parylene C coated with 70 nm of CYTOP. Furthermore, the minimum actuation threshold voltage followed a previously published scaling model for the threshold voltage, VT, which is proportional to (t/{$\varepsilon$}r)1/2, where t and {$\varepsilon$}r are the insulator thickness and dielectric constant respectively. Device threshold voltages are compared for several insulator thicknesses (200 nm, 500 nm, and 1 â®m), different dielectric materials (parylene C and tantalum pentoxide), and homogeneous versus heterogeneous compositions.

Unlike solid objects, fluids are intrinsically divisible, enriching their fundamental operations with merging, dispensing, and splitting on top of moving. Fluids are sticky as well, calling for their lossless manipulation to prevent mass loss and contamination. We present photopyroelectric microfluidics that meet all the requirements. In response to the irradiation from even one single beam of light, our platform creates a unique wavy dielectrophoretic force field that is remarkably capable of performing desired loss-free (loss being 0.5\% of existing one) manipulation of droplets of surface tension from 18.9 to 98.0 mN m               -1               and volume from 1 nl to 1000 {$\mu$}l, functioning as a ``magic'' wetting-proof hand to navigate, fuse, pinch, and cleave fluids on demand, enabling cargo carriers with droplet wheels and upgrading the limit of maximum concentration of deliverable protein by 4000-fold.},

Therefore, the development of novel sensing methods for in-situ detection of various nutrients in water is urgently needed and of great significance. Microfluidic techniques provide promising and effective analytical tools for high-performance sensing platforms to monitor nutrients in water due to their advantages such as time-saving, less reagent consumption, better process control, portability and ability to on-site detection. In this review, the latest improvements in microfluidic sensors for monitoring nutrients in water are extensively explained. First, the various substrate materials and current microfluidic technologies are briefly addressed. Then, microfluidic approaches for the determination of nitrate, nitrite, ammonia nitrogen, phosphate and silicate are described in detail, emphasizing those works published after 2016. For each device, the sensing principle, device fabrication, and detection performance are presented. Finally, upcoming perspectives and future challenges are thoroughly discussed.},

More recently, DMFBs based on a microelectrode-dot-array (MEDA) architecture have been proposed, and droplet manipulations on MEDA biochips have also been experimentally demonstrated. In order to ensure robust fluidic operations and high confidence in the outcome of biochemical experiments, MEDA biochips must be adequately tested before they can be used for bioassay execution. This paper presents the first approach for testing of MEDA biochips that include both CMOS circuits and microfluidic components. We first present structural test techniques to evaluate the pass/fail status of each microcell (droplet actuation, droplet maintenance, and droplet sensing) and identify faulty microcells. In order to ensure correct operation of functional units, e.g., mixers and diluters, we also present functional test techniques to address fundamental MEDA operations, such as droplet dispensing, transportation, mixing, and splitting. We evaluate the proposed test methods using simulations as well as experiments for fabricated MEDA biochips.},

In PB-DMF chips, electrodes are control wires are printed on the same paper surface, while electrodes can be placed with custom structure. In this paper, we present test and diagnosis methods for faults in PB-DMF. A design-fordiagnosability scheme is proposed, and it is shown that single faults can be located and tolerated by providing alternative paths in PB-DMF chips.

However, the complexity of drop manipulation and sample preparation on-chip has limited its incorporation into daily workflow. In this paper, we report a novel method for flexible sample delivery on digital microfluidics in a wide volume range spanning four orders of magnitude from picoliters to nanoliters. The method is based on the phenomenon of satellite droplet ejection, triggered by a sudden change in the strength of the electric field across a drop on a hydrophobic dielectric surface. By precisely modulating the actuation signal with convenient external electric controls, satellite droplet ejection can be turned on to dispense samples or turned off to transport picking-up drops. A pico-dosing design is presented and validated in this work to demonstrate the direct and flexible on-chip sample delivery. This approach could pave the way for the acceptance of microfluidics as a common platform for daily reactions to realize lab-on-a-chip.},

Previous studies were mainly dependent on the special asymmetric structures, which inevitably have the problem of slow transport speed and short distance. To improve control\- lability, researchers have attempted to use external fields, such as thermal, light, electric fields, and magnetic fields, to achieve controllable droplet transport. On the fundamental side, much of their widespread applicably is due to the degree of control over droplet transport. This review provides an overview of recent progress in the last three years toward the transport of droplets with different mechanisms induced by various external stimuli, including light, electric, thermal, and magnetic field. First, the relevant basic theory and typical induced gradient for directional liquid transport are illustrated.

One of the most popular ways of droplet generation in electrowetting devices is to split a droplet from a preloaded volume as a fluid reservoir. This method is effective, but lowers volume consistency after multiple droplets are generated. Impedance- and capacitance-based methods of volume metering have been successfully used in digital microfluidics, but require complex circuitry and feedback signal processing. In this work, we demonstrate nanoliter droplet generation from a continuous electrowetting channel used as a replenishable fluid reservoir which compensates for the loss of reservoir volume as droplets are sequentially split. This improves volume consistency especially for applications requiring multi-droplet generation. Based on the area of the electrode, the volume of each droplet split from the electrowetting channel can be obtained by a simple and precise image processing technique with no need for additional hardware and measurement errors of {\textpm}0.05 \%. This simple technique can be used in a wide range of applications that require precise volume metering, such as immunoassay.},

  abstract = {Sample preparation plays an essential role in most biochemical reactions. Raw reactants are diluted to solutions with desirable concentration values in this process. Since the reactants, like infant's blood, DNA evidence collected from crime scenes, or costly reagents, are extremely valuable, their usage should be minimized whenever possible. In this paper, we propose a two-phased reactant minimization algorithm (REMIA), for sample preparation on digital microfluidic biochips. In the former phase, REMIA builds a reactant-minimized interpolated dilution tree with specific leaf nodes for a target concentration. Two approaches are developed for tree construction; one is based on integer linear programming (ILP) and the other is heuristic. The ILP one guarantees to produce an optimal dilution tree with minimal reactant consumption, whereas the heuristic one ensures runtime efficiency. Then, REMIA constructs a forest consisting of exponential dilution trees to produce those aforementioned specific leaf nodes with minimal reactant consumption in the latter phase. Experimental results show that REMIA achieves a reduction of reactant usage by 32\%--52\% as compared with three existing state-of-the-art sample preparation approaches. Besides, REMIA can be easily extended to solve the sample preparation problem with multiple target concentrations, and the extended version also effectively lowers the reactant consumption further.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic chips are liquid processors that perform biochemical assays by moving, merging and splitting droplets using the electrowetting effect. Yet, hardwiring electrowetting chips becomes tedious as soon as they include more than a few dozen electrodes. Single-sided continuous opto-electrowetting, where the electrowetting effect of a featureless semiconductor film is controlled by light patterns is a promising solution to this hardwiring bottleneck, but so far two-dimensional manipulation of droplets is still difficult. Here, we demonstrate the manipulation of droplets along arbitrary directions by using Z-shaped light patterns that rotate the electric field by an arbitrary angle. We provide a theoretical model for driving droplets in different directions. It is verified by Comsol simulations and experiments. Optimization of the width of the notches provides quite large increase of the driving voltage in the y-direction. The chip can move dyed water droplets in the y-direction at a maximum speed of 4.86 mm/s. Such multidimensional droplet driving opens new possibilities for single-sided continuous optoelectrowetting such as merging droplets that are not in line, efficient droplet mixing, and bypassing droplets to avoid coalescence.},

There is a strong demand for robust, cost-effective, and simple-to-operate instruments for molecular diagnostics. The features of microfluidics, such as short analysis time, reduction in fabrication costs, and low sample/reagent consumption, make it a natural fit for the development of new diagnostic instruments. Herein, selected work is highlighted to provide a snapshot of microfluidic devices developed for molecular diagnostics in the past 5 years, specifically focusing on their applications for the detection of agents clinically relevant to cancers, cardiac conditions, and infectious diseases, and an outlook on how microfluidics technology can be further advanced for applications in this area.},

  abstract = {Digital imaging permits the quantitation of many experiments, such as microbiological growth assays, but laboratory digital imaging systems can be expensive and too specialised. The Raspberry Pi camera platform makes automated, controlled imaging affordable with accessible customisation. When combined with open source software and open-source 3D printed hardware, the control over image quality and capture of this platform permits the rapid development of novel instrumentation. Here we present ``PiRamid'', a compact, portable, and inexpensive enclosure for autonomous imaging both in the laboratory and in the field. The modular three-piece 3D printed design makes it easy to incorporate different camera systems or lighting configurations (e.g., single wavelength LED for fluorescence). The enclosed design allows complete control of illumination unlike a conventional digital camera or smartphone, on a tripod or handheld, under ambient lighting. The stackable design permits rapid sample addition or camera focus adjustment, with a corresponding change in magnification and resolution. The entire unit is small enough to fit within a microbiological incubator, and cheap enough (\${\pounds}100) to scale out for larger parallel experiments. Simply, Python scripts fully automate illumination and image capture for small-scale experiments with an \$110{\^A}85 mm area at 70--90 lm resolution. We demonstrate the versatility of PiRamid by capturing time-resolved, quantitative image data for a wide range of assays. Bacterial growth kinetics was captured for conventional microbiology (agar Petri dishes), 3D printed custom microbiology labware and microfluidic microbiology. To illustrate application beyond microbiology, we demonstrate time-lapse imaging of crystal growth and degradation of salad leaves. Minor modifications permit epi-illumination by addition of a LED ring to the camera module. We conclude that PiRamid permits inexpensive digital capture and quantitation of a wide range of experiments by time-lapse imaging to simplify both laboratory and field imaging.},

The drop position is determined measuring the equivalent capacitance of the EWOD electrode, whose value varies according to the presence of the fluid over the pad. In the presented system, the capacitance measurement is achieved through the ``Frequency Shift Oscillator'' method: the EWOD electrode is inserted in an oscillator circuit, whose operating frequency is inversely proportional to the electrode capacitance value. A microcontroller, included in the system, counts the number of rising edges at the output of the circuit determining the oscillation frequency. The oscillator has been simulated and subsequently fabricated on a double layer printed circuit board. A very good agreement between simulations and experiments has been achieved. The value of obtained sensitivity is not lower than 1.2 kHz/pF that corresponds to a minimum detectable capacitance variation of 0.167 pF. This value is well below the variation of capacitance due to the presence of the droplet above the EWOD electrode and demonstrates the suitability of our circuit as a successful drop position sensor.},

Programming DMFBs has historically been accomplished by writing low-level bit manipulations to select which electrodes should activate in sequence. Recent research on high-level programming languages and compilers for DMFBs have begun to address the programmability challenge, but important capabilities such as loading and executing pre-compiled libraries and function calls, are absent from the literature. A primary driver of this oversight is the lack of a memory hierarchy to store physical chemicals off-chip to jump to and from function calls. This paper addresses the complexities involved in compiling function calls within the technology's unique boundaries, and provides a proof-of-concept implementation from language to code generation, with solutions evaluated using a cycleaccurate DMFB simulator as well as physical execution on an open-hardware DMFB.},

In this paper, a chip scale sensing system, which is composed of a planar integrated optical microdisk resonator and a thin film InGaAs photodetector, is integrated with a digital microfluidic system. This system was designed, fabricated, and experimentally characterized by dispensing and moving droplets of glucose solution from the reservoir to the microresonator sensor. The optical output of the resonator was transduced by the integrated photodetector to an electrical current signal for readout.},

  abstract = {The advent of digital microfluidic lab-on-a-chip (LoC) technology offers a platform for developing diagnostic applications with the advantages of portability, increased automation, low-power consumption, compatibility with mass manufacturing, and high throughput. However, most digital microfluidic platforms incorporate limited optical capabilities (e.g., optical transmission) for integrated sensing, because more complex optical functions are difficult to integrate into the digital microfluidic platform. This follows since the sensor must be compatible with the hydrophobic surfaces on which electrowetting liquid transport occurs. With the emergence of heterogeneous photonic component integration technologies such as those described herein, the opportunity for integrating advanced photonic components has expanded considerably. Many diagnostic applications could benefit from the integration of more advanced miniaturized optical sensing technologies, such as index of refraction sensors (surface plasmon resonance sensors, microresonator sensors, etc.). The advent of these heterogeneous integration technologies, that enable the integration of thin-film semiconductor devices onto arbitrary host substrates, enables more complex optical functions, and in particular, planar optical systems, to be integrated into microfluidic systems. This paper presents an integrated optical sensor based upon the heterogeneous integration of an InGaAs-based thin-film photodetector with a digital microfluidic system. This demonstration of the heterogeneous integration and operation of an active optical thin-film device with a digital microfluidic system is the first step toward the heterogeneous integration of entire planar optical sensing systems on this platform.},

In the present work, a combined numerical and experimental approach was employed to study the EW response of a droplet subject to both direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) actuating signals. Computational fluid dynamics models were developed by using the Volume of Fluid (VOF)-Continuous Surface Force (CSF) method. A dynamic contact angle model based on the molecular kinetic theory was implemented as the boundary condition at the moving contact line, which considers the effects of the contact line friction and the pinning force. The droplet shape evolution under DC condition and the interfacial resonance oscillation under AC condition were investigated. It was found that the numerical models were able to accurately predict the key parameters of electrowetting-induced droplet dynamics.},

  abstract = {The active matrix (AM)-based architecture offers many advantages over conventional digital electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) microfluidic biochips, such as the capability of handling variable-size droplets, more flexible droplet movement, and precise control over droplet navigation. However, a major challenge in choosing the routing paths is to decide when the droplets are to be reshaped depending on the congestion of the intended path, or split- and route sub droplets,and merging them at their respective destinations. As the number of microelectrodes in AM-EWOD chips is large, the path selection problem becomes further complicated. In this article, we propose a negotiation-guided flow based on routing of subdroplets that obviates the explicit need for deciding when the droplets are to be manipulated, yet fully utilizing the power of droplet reshaping, splitting, and merging them to facilitate their journey. The proposed algorithm reduces routing cost and provides more freedom in deadlock avoidance in the presence of multiple routing tasks by assigning certain congestion penalty for sibling subdroplets and fluidic penalty for heterogeneous droplets. Compared to existing techniques, it reduces latest arrival time by an average of 29\% for several benchmark and random test suites. Furthermore, our method is observed to provide 100\% routability of nets for all test cases, whereas existing and baseline routers fail to produce feasible solutions in many instances. We also propose a reliable mode droplet routing strategy where the number of unreliable splitting operations can be reduced by paying a small penalty on latest arrival time.},

However, synthesis algorithms and biochip design methods proposed in the literature are oblivious to completion-time uncertainties in fluidic operations, and they do not meet the requirements of cyberphysical integration in digital microfluidics. We present an operation-interdependency-aware synthesis method that uses frequency scaling and is responsive to uncertainties that are inherent in the completion times of fluidic operations such as mixing and thermal cycling. Using this design approach, we can carry out dynamic on-line decision making for the execution of fluidic operations in response to detector feedback. We use three common laboratorial protocols to demonstrate that, compared to uncertainty-oblivious biochip design, the proposed dynamic decision making approach is more effective in satisfying realistic physical constraints. As a result, it decreases the likelihood of erroneous reaction outcomes, and it leads to reduced time-to-results, less repetition of reaction steps, and less wastage of precious samples and reagents.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic biochips are being increasingly used for biotechnology applications. The number of control pins used to drive electrodes is a major contributor to fabrication cost for disposable biochips in a highly cost-sensitive market. Most prior work on pin-constrained biochip design determines the mapping of a small number of control pins to a larger number of electrodes according to the specific schedule of fluid-handling operations and routing paths of droplets. Such designs are therefore specific to the bioassay application, hence sacrificing some of the flexibility associated with digital microfluidics. We propose a design method to generate an application-independent pin-assignment configuration with a minimum number of control pins. Layouts of a commercial biochip and laboratory prototypes are used as case studies to evaluate the proposed design method for determining a suitable pin-assignment configuration. Compared with previous pin-assignment algorithms, the proposed method can reduce the number of control pins and facilitate the ``general-purpose'' use of digital microfluidic biochips for a wide range of applications.},

  abstract = {Droplet-based digital microfluidics technology has now come of age, and software-controlled biochips for healthcare applications are starting to emerge. However, today's digital microfluidic biochips suffer from the drawback that there is no feedback to the control software from the underlying hardware platform. Due to the lack of precision inherent in biochemical experiments, errors are likely during droplet manipulation; error recovery based on the repetition of experiments leads to wastage of expensive reagents and hard-to-prepare samples. By exploiting recent advances in the integration of optical detectors (sensors) into a digital microfluidics biochip, we present a physicalaware system reconfiguration technique that uses sensor data at intermediate checkpoints to dynamically reconfigure the biochip. A cyberphysical resynthesis technique is used to recompute electrode-actuation sequences, thereby deriving new schedules, module placement, and droplet routing pathways, with minimum impact on the time-to-response.},

  abstract = {Abstract             A digital microfluidic system based on electrowetting-on-dielectric is a new technology for controlling microliter-sized droplets on a plane. By applying a voltage signal to an electrode, the droplets can be controlled to move, merge, and split. Due to device design, fabrication, and runtime uncertainties, feedback control schemes are necessary to ensure the reliability and accuracy of a digital microfluidic system for practical application. The premise of feedback is to obtain accurate droplet position information. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop a digital microfluidics system integrated with driving, position, and feedback functions for different areas of study. In this article, we propose a driving and feedback scheme based on machine vision for the digital microfluidics system. A series of experiments including droplet motion, merging, status detection, and self-adaption are performed to evaluate the feasibility and the reliability of the proposed scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can accurately locate multiple droplets and improve the success rate of different applications. Furthermore, the proposed scheme provides an experimental platform for scientists who focused on the digital microfluidics system.},

  abstract = {Microfluidic systems are part of an emerging technology which deals with minute amounts of liquids (biological samples and reagents) on a small scale. They are fast, compact and can be made into a highly integrated system to deliver sample purification, separation, reaction, immobilization, labelling, as well as detection, thus are promising for applications such as lab-on-a-chip and handheld healthcare devices. Miniaturized micropumps typically consist of a moving-part component, such as a membrane structure, to deliver liquids, and are often unreliable, complicated in structure and difficult to be integrated with other control electronics circuits. The trend of new-generation micropumps is moving-part-free micropumps operated by advanced techniques, such as electrokinetic force, surface tension/energy, acoustic waves. This paper reviews the development and advances of relevant technologies, and introduces electrowetting-on-dielectrics and acoustic wave-based microfluidics. The programmable electrowetting micropump has been realized to dispense and manipulate droplets in 2D with up to 1000 addressable electrodes and electronics built underneath. The acoustic wave-based microfluidics can be used not only for pumping, mixing and droplet generation but also for biosensors, suitable for single-mechanism-based lab-on-a-chip applications.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic systems (DMFS) are an emerging class of lab-on-a-chip systems that manipulate individual droplets of chemicals on a planar array of electrodes. The biochemical analyses are performed by repeatedly moving, mixing, and splitting droplets on the electrodes. Mixers and storage units, composed of electrodes, are two important functional resources. Mixers perform droplet mixing and splitting operations, while storage units store droplets that have been produced for subsequent mixings. In this paper, we focus on minimizing the completion time of biochemical analyses by exploiting the binary tree representation of analyses to schedule mixing operations. Using pipelining, we overlap mixing operations with input and transportation operations. We find the lower bound of the mixing completion time based on the tree structure of input analyses, and calculate the minimum number of mixers required to achieve the lower bound. We present a scheduling algorithm for the case with a specified number of mixers , and prove it is optimal to minimize the mixing completion time. We also analyze resource constraint issues for two extreme cases. For the case with just one mixer, we prove that all schedules that keep the mixer busy at all times result in the same mixing completion time and then design algorithms for scheduling and to minimize the number of storage units. For the case with zero storage units, we find the minimum number of mixers required. We extend our analyses and algorithms assuming identical mixing durations to the case of different mixing durations. Finally, we illustrate the benefits of our scheduling methods on an example of DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.},

First, the principle of electrowetting applied in small and confined configurations is introduced and the cause of the failure of the dielectric layer is analyzed. Then, the function of the pixel structures is described to avoid display defects. Next, electric signal modulations are compared in terms of achieving good image quality and optical stability. Lastly, the methods are presented for color panel realization. It was concluded that multi-layer dielectrics, three-dimensional pixel structures, proper electric frequency-and-amplitude modulation and an RGB color panel are expected to resolve the current limitations and contribute to designing advanced reflective displays.},

Apart from being expensive, many of the detection methods require trained personnel and are often time-consuming. With drastic climate changes, severe droughts, increases in population and pollution of natural water systems, the need to develop ultrasensitive, low-cost and hand-held, point-of-use detection kits to monitor water quality is critical. Although Escherichia coli is still considered the best indicator of water quality, cell numbers may be below detection limits, or the cells may be non-culturable and thus only detected by DNA amplification. A number of different biosensors have been developed to detect viable, dead or non-culturable microbial cells and chemicals in water. This review discusses the differences in these biosensors and evaluates the application of microfluidics in the design of ultra-sensitive nano-biosensors.},

  abstract = {We study the thermocapillary migration of two-dimensional droplets of partially wetting liquids on a non-uniformly heated surface. The effect of a non-zero contact angle is imposed through a disjoining--conjoining pressure term. The numerical results for two different molecular interactions are compared: on the one hand, London--van der Waals and ionic--electrostatics molecular interactions that account for polar liquids; on the other hand, long- and short-range molecular forces that model molecular interactions of non-polar fluids. In addition, the effect of gravity on the velocity of the drop is analysed. We find that for small contact angles, the long-time dynamics is independent of the molecular potential, and the footprint of the droplet increases with the square root of time. For intermediate contact angles we observe that polar droplets are more likely to break up into smaller volumes than non-polar ones. A linear stability analysis allows us to predict the number of droplets after breakup occurs. In this regime, the effect of gravity is stabilizing: it reduces the growth rates of the unstable modes and increases the shortest unstable wavelength. When breakup is not observed, the droplet moves steadily with a profile that consists in a capillary ridge followed by a film of constant thickness, for which we find power law dependencies with the cross-sectional area of the droplet, the contact angle and the temperature gradients. For large contact angles, non-polar liquids move faster than polar ones, and the velocity is proportional to the Marangoni stress. We find power law dependencies for the velocity for the different regimes of flow. The numerical results allow us to shed light on experimental facts such as the origin of the elongation of droplets and the existence of saturation velocity.},

LODs today enable scientists to implement and integrate different operational units, including fluid mixing, droplet generation, cell-sorting, gene amplification, analyte detection, and so forth. For an efficient design and cost-effective implementation of any microfluidic device, including LODs, theoretical analysis and considerations should play a more important role than they currently do. The theoretical analysis we will show is especially essential to the investigation of detailed phenomena at the small length scales and high-speed typical for LODs where a wide range of forces may be involved. Previous LOD review papers presented mostly experimental results with theory as an afterthought. Hence, a review paper focused on the theoretical aspects, and associated computational studies of LOD devices is an urgent need. In the present review paper, all previous computational studies on LOD devices are categorized as single-phase flows, two-phase flows, network simulation, and solids. For each of these categories, the governing equations and important formulas are presented and explained. Moreover, a handy scaling analysis is introduced to aid scientists when comparing different competing forces in LOD devices. We hope that by surveying and contrasting various theoretical LOD studies, we shed some light on existing controversies and reveal where additional theoretical work is needed.},

This paper is motivated by recent demand from the synthetic biology community for electrowetting on dielectric (EWD) enabled in-droplet electroporation, but is generalizable to a range of EWD applications that require shielding structures to be patterned on the EWD. An electrode patterned in an additional metal layer on the insulator that supports EWD actuation reduces the effective strength of the EW force due to dielectric shielding at the droplet contact line. A numerical model was developed to predict the impact of the partially shielding electrode on threshold voltage, EW force, fluid velocity, and droplet transport time. Compared with a batch of devices lacking the extra electrode, the presence of the added metal layer resulted in a 29\% increase in threshold voltage, an 82\% increase in transport time, and a 44\% decrease in average transport velocity. Each trend agrees with the simulation results obtained from the fluid transport model. These results support the development of design rules for microfluidic devices that require partially shielding metal layers to integrate with EWD device architectures.},

As a conventional double-plate EWOD device requires a grounded electrode on the top-plate, it will cause additional fabrication complicity and cost during the encapsulation process. In this work, we found that by carefully designing the electrode arrangement and configuring the driving electronic circuit, the droplet driving force can be maintained with a floating electrode on the top-plate. This can provide the possibilities to integrate additional electrical or electrochemical sensing functions on the top-plate. We use both finite element analysis and the fabricated system to validate the theory, and the results indicate that floating top-electrode EWOD systems are highly reliable and reproducible once the design considerations are fully met.},

In this paper, we are proposing a novel and efficient technique for detecting a single fault and identifying the fault location within the biochip. Along with that it can also calculate the traversal time if the biochip is fault free. The traversal of the microarray is carried out by scanning the intermediate cells and the edges by special types of movement pattern RDRD (Right-Down-Right-Down) and DRDR (DownRight-Down-Right) for left and right diagonal electrode traversal respectively and the boundary cells and edges are traversed in clockwise direction by moving the test droplets. If a fault is detected then the proposed technique also locates it by backtracking the droplet. The simulated result suggests that the proposed technique is efficient and represents significant improvement in fault detection and calculating traversal time of a fault free biochip over existing methods.},

Generation and manipulation of liquid droplets at single pixel level with the volume coefficient of variation around 1\% is demonstrated. Such performance is substantial improvement over current state-of-the-art (9-pixel resolution and 4\% variation).

  abstract = {This work reports on a dynamically configurable micro-array surface plasmon resonance biochip platform. The platform comprises a digital electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) microfluidic device tailored to surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi). We demonstrate its application for simultaneous immobilization of different DNA probes at the designated detection sites on-chip from sub-â®L volume solutions in combination with multichannel label-free real-time detection of subsequent hybridization reactions. Successful on-chip DNA probe dilution and immobilization is also demonstrated using SPRi hybridization detection. Furthermore, active control of the immobilized probe density and orientation is achieved under an applied potential using the electric interface of the EWOD device. For low probe densities, under negative applied potential, the DNA hybridization efficiency is enhanced compared to passive probe immobilization, yielding a two-fold SPR signal increase within only 8 min of hybridization. EWOD microfluidic platform coupled with SPRi promises to dramatically increase the speed of detection and quantification of biomolecular interactions while reducing reagent consumption. The proposed system would enable the development of high-throughput, rapid and ultrasensitive detection of biomolecules beyond DNA microarray applications.},

In essence, this technique relies on the correlation between the capacitance of two top-bottom electrodes with the amount of droplet overlap on the electrode. This paper describes an experimental setup used to gather capacitance data from a set of electrodes with varying droplet overlap to determine the droplet position. A prototype closed digital microfluidic (DMF) system consisting of an array of electrodes in the form of a 2 {\texttimes} 2 matrix was fabricated. A circular droplet was positioned on the DMF system, and capacitance measurements for each of the four electrodes were taken using a fast data acquisition device. A sufficiently accurate approximation of the droplet position was made using the four capacitance measurements. The paper presents the experimental results and also discusses the sources of error, viability of the experimental setup and manufacturing procedure for use in the development of capacitance measurement droplet position sensing techniques.},

If it is to be commercially available to the public, it needs to have the essential features of smart sensing and a compact size. In this work, we report on a fractal electrode biosensor that is used for both droplet actuation and sensing C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration levels to assess cardiac disease risk. Our proposed electrode is the first two-terminal electrode design to be integrated into DMF platforms. A simulation of the electrical field distribution shows reduced peak intensities and uniform distribution of the field. When compared to a V-notch square electrode, the fractal electrode shows a superior performance in both aspects, i.e. field uniformity and intensity. These improvements are translated into a successful and responsive actuation of a water droplet with 100V. Likewise, the effective dielectric strength is improved by a 33\% increase in the fractal electrode breakdown voltage. Additionally, the capability of the fractal electrode to work as a capacitive biosensor is evaluated with CRP quantification test. Selected fractal electrodes undergo a surface treatment to immobilize anti-CRP antibodies on their surface. The measurement shows a response to the added CRP in capacitance within three minutes. When the untreated electrodes were used for quantification, there was no significant change in capacitance, and this suggested that immobilization was necessary. The electrodes configuration in the fabricated DMF platform allows the fractal electrodes to be selectively used as biosensors, which means the device could be integrated into point-of-care applications.},

Hydrophobic coating is required to lower surface friction and enhance droplet movement over the surface. FSNPs are synthesized by a modified St{\"o}ber method, with different sizes of nanoparticles (5 to 150 nm) and various degrees of fluorination (0 to 90\%). These FSNP coatings and natural superhydrophobic surface, Colocasia leaf, were characterized with SEM and tested for their EWOD performance, i.e. EWOD voltage and contact angle change. Colocasia leaf required voltages of N 300 V for EWOD, whereas the performance of the FSNP coatings with varying nanoparticle sizes and degrees of fluorination show EWOD with voltages as low as 20 V. The robustness of the FSNP surfaces was demonstrated by using various organic solvents, and longevity data is also presented.},

Despite its ubiquity, the complexity of designing and controlling custom microfluidic devices present major barriers to adoption, requiring intuitive knowledge gained from years of experience. If these barriers were overcome, microfluidics could miniaturize biological and chemical research for non-experts through fully-automated platform development and operation. The intuition of microfluidic experts can be captured through machine learning, where complex statistical models are trained for pattern recognition and subsequently used for event prediction. Integration of machine learning with microfluidics could significantly expand its adoption and impact.

The sensor system consists of a disk as active area immobilized for capturing any special particles. This disk can azimuthally vibrate by means of two in phase electrostatic actuators both sides. Two capacitive sensing elements determine the vibrating amplitude. The moving droplets by digital microfluidic module will envelope the disk of active zone, so the captured particles can change the vibration frequency of resonance. Due to azimuthal vibration, the fluidic damping is low enough to achieve measurable quality factor by resonator. The total system is simulated and the result is presented.},

The objective of this paper is to present an overall system to control droplet movement inside microfluidic channel using fuzzy logic controller, image processing algorithm, and microvalves installed within microfluidic channel. A state space model has been derived from circuit analogy approach to describe the microfluidic network. Furthermore, a COMSOL-based study is primed for device structure by means of droplet generation and controlling the droplet through fitted valves. Moreover, an image processing algorithm based on active contours has been proposed in this research to track the movement of the droplet through the channel. This droplet controlling method is utterly based on fuzzy controller as well as camera images to move the droplet at desired position by controlling flow rates inside the fluidic channel using valves installed inside the microfluidic device. The results indicate that the fuzzy logic controller performs much better in terms of stability and faster response as compared to conventional proportional--integral--derivative controller.},

The commercially available printed circuit board technology is used for the electrode fabrication to further decrease the costs. Silicone rubber is used as the dielectric layer and a commercially available water repellant spray is used as the hydrophobic layer instead of the relatively expensive Teflon-AF commonly used in the literature.

Within the clinical laboratory industry the impetus for change has come from technological development (miniaturization, nanotechnology, and their collective effect on point-of-care testing; POCT) and the increasingly global nature of laboratory services. Potential technological gains in POCT include: the development of bio-sensors, microarrays, genetics and proteomics testing, and enhanced web connectivity. In globalization, prospective opportunities lie in: medical tourism, the migration of healthcare workers, cross-border delivery of testing, and the establishment of accredited laboratories in previously unexplored markets. Accompanying these impressive opportunities are equally imposing challenges. Difficulty transitioning from research to clinical use, poor infrastructure in developing countries, cultural differences and national barriers to global trade are only a few examples. Dealing with the issues presented by globalization and the impact of developing technology on POCT, and on the clinical laboratory services industry in general, will be a daunting task. Despite such concerns, with appropriate countermeasures it will be possible to address the challenges posed. Future laboratory success will be largely dependent on one's ability to adapt in this perpetually shifting landscape.},

  abstract = {The scope of this work is to obtain and characterize a nanobiocomposite as Ion Selective Electrodes (ISE) for nitrate ion determination in water. This nanocomposite is based upon the intercalation of chitosan, a cationic biopolymer, in bentonite. Chitosan (CS)/bentonite nanocomposites were prepared by ionic exchange. The amino groups in the CS can be protonated in acidic solution and they can replace the interlayer cation on the clay surface. Nitrate (II) was added at the end of the preparation process for blocking the cationic exchange sites and enhance the potentiometric response to nitrate. Chitosan/bentonite films were obtained by solvent cast method. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), XRay Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and FourierTransformed-Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to characterize the nanocomposites. These studies confirm that the chitosan was intercalated into the bentonite interlayer spacing due to the electrostatic attraction between NH3+ groups and the negatively charge bentonite surface. These measurements confirm that there exist possibilities to reverse the ion exchange of this nanocomposite. Potentiometric measurements were performed using an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and an ISE with chitosan/bentonite membranes deposited on a graphite-epoxy electrode as a working electrode. A linear fitting was performed between 2{\texttimes}10-4 M and 8{\texttimes}10-1 M of concentration with a near Nernstian slope of -54.6 mV/dec. The selectivity towards some interfering ions was calculated according to the Separate Solution Method (SSM).},

However, the limited number of electrode control wirings for droplet control intrinsically restrains the massive generation of pL/nL individual droplets, fundamentally hindering the realization of high throughput applications on DMF such as digital nucleic acid amplification and analysis. This work demonstrates on-chip high throughput digital loopmediated isothermal amplification (dLAMP) on a DMF platform based on a functional substrate with superwettability contrast. Exploiting the passive dispensing technique as empowered by electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) effect, a total of 1818 individual droplets with high uniformity are generated on the super-hydrophilic microarray within 1 min. Separation within the oil phase without tubes and valves can avoid evaporation, ensuring a precise total reaction volume. Absolute quantification of {$\lambda$}DNA with a dynamic range of 1--1000 copies/{$\mu$}L is achieved by counting the amount of positive microdroplets after on-chip incubation, demonstrating the strong potential for rapid, low-cost, reliable, and quantitative nucleic acid analysis with high accuracy.},

In this study, the mechanism of droplet formation in microchannel structure and factors affecting droplet formation were studied. The physical field of laminar two-phase flow level was used to simulate the process of droplet generation through microfluidic technology. The effect of the parameters including flow rate, surface tension, and viscosity on the generated droplet size were evaluated by the simulation. After that, the microfluidic chip that has the same dimension as the simulation was then, fabricated and evaluated. The chip was made by conventional SU-8 photolithography and injection molding. The accuracy of the simulation was validated by comparing the generated droplets in the real scenario with the simulation result. The relative error (RE) between experimentally measured droplet diameter and simulation results under different flow rate, viscosity, surface tension and contact angle was found less than 3.5\%, 1.8\%, 1.4\%, and 1.2\%, respectively. Besides, the coefficient of variation (CV) of the droplet diameter was less than 1\%, which indicates the experimental droplet generation was of high stability and reliability. This study provides not only fundamental information for the design and experiment of droplet generation by microfluidic technology but also a reliable and efficient investigation method in the ddPCR field.},

This review will summarize selected microfluidic concepts and tools with potential applications to aerosol science. Where appropriate, the basic operating conditions and tunable parameters in microfluidics will be compared to typical aerosol experimental methods. Microfluidics offers a number of advantages over larger-scale experiments; for example, the small volumes of sample required for experiments open a number of avenues for sample collection that are accessible to the aerosol community. Filter extraction, spot sampling, and particle-into-liquid sampling techniques could all be used to capture aerosol samples to supply microfluidic measurements and experiments. Microfluidic concepts, such as device geometries for creating emulsions and developments in particle and droplet manipulation techniques will be reviewed, and current and potential microfluidic applications to aerosol science will be discussed.},

Qualitatively, the process is analogous to the electrowetting of aqueous electrolyte solutions: the contact angle versus voltage curve has a parabolic shape which saturates at larger voltages (positive or negative). On the other hand we observed several peculiarities: (i) the efficiency is significantly lower (by about an order of magnitude); (ii) the influence of the bulky cation is larger and the importance of the smaller anion is lesser, especially with respect to electrowetting saturation; (iii) there is an asymmetry in the saturation contact angles found for positive and negative voltages. The asymmetry may be correlated with the cationanion asymmetry of the ionic liquids. The low efficiency may be caused by the presence of water and other impurities in these commercial materials.},

Compared with the conventional microfluidic devices that require extra liquid as a carrier and a complex pumping system to operate, DMF is an ideal platform for ion-selective sensing as it enables the droplet operation in a discrete, accurate, and automatic way. However, it is quite rare that DMF platform is utilized for the ion-selective detection. In this paper, we report an integrated DMF system which combines DMF and ionselective sensing for facile blending of multiple ions, and detection of targeted primary ion. The platform is fabricated through an additive manufacturing method, together with the real-time droplet's motion monitoring feedback system. Thus, the fabricated system demonstrates controlled droplet manipulation ability including droplet actuation, mixing, and speed control. Targeted primary ion is selectively detected under concentration range from 10-6 to 1 M. The interference study with blended ions has been investigated through on-chip ion selective membranes.},

Vertical channels have been fabricated through combined 3D printing methods to facilitate stable and controlled movement of water droplets. The interfaces among liquid, gas, and solid were analyzed through Young-Lippmann law. We calculated the actuation force in a series of different configurations to enable us to optimize the system. Inspired by xylem structures in plants, the vertical movement and pumping of droplets are demonstrated by a programmable control system with a built-in boost converter for a real-time operating and portable DMF system.

Various types of DMF devices have been demonstrated to improve their capabilities such as smaller device size for portability, higher reliability, and multi-purpose applications, etc. Among them, the electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) is one of the most widely used mechanisms to manipulate droplets due to its good flexibility. On the other hand, the high-voltage application that required for EWOD-type DMF also limits the portability and dimension of the whole system. In this review, we discuss the DMFs which are powered by alternative sources other than electrical sources and evaluate their potential for future portable biochemical assays. Then, the demonstrations reported with the possibility beyond high voltage are discussed starting from lowering voltage requirement for EWODs to the unique methods using mechanical, optical, and energy harvesting to power DMF devices. Finally, the practical applications and prospective on the integrated multi-functional lab-on-a-chip applications are tackled.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a high-performance droplet router for a digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) design. Due to recent advancements in the biomicroelectromechanical system and its various applications to clinical, environmental, and military operations, the design complexity and the scale of a DMFB are expected to explode in the near future, thus requiring strong support from CAD as in conventional VLSI design. Among the multiple design stages of a DMFB, droplet routing, which schedules the movement of each droplet in a time-multiplexed manner, is one of the most critical design challenges due to high complexity as well as large impacts on performance. Our algorithm first routes a droplet with higher bypassibility which is less likely to block the movement of the others. When multiple droplets form a deadlock, our algorithm resolves it by backing off some droplets for concession. The final compaction step further enhances timing as well as fault tolerance by tuning each droplet movement greedily. The experimental results on hard benchmarks show that our algorithm achieves over 35{\texttimes} and 20{\texttimes} better routability with comparable timing and fault tolerance than the popular prioritized A{$\ast$} search and the state-of-the-art network-flow-based algorithm, respectively.},

A variety of different approaches has been adopted, from external heating sources to Joule heating, microwaves or the use of lasers to cite just a few examples. The scope of the technical solutions developed to date is impressive and encompasses for instance temperature ramp rates ranging from 0.1 to 2,000 {$^\circ$}C/s leading to homogeneous temperatures from -3 {$^\circ$}C to 120 {$^\circ$}C, and constant gradients from 6 to 40 {$^\circ$}C/mm with a fair degree of accuracy. We also examine some recent strategies developed for applications such as digital microfluidics, where integration of a heating source to generate a temperature gradient offers control of a key parameter, without necessarily requiring great accuracy. Conversely, Temperature Gradient Focusing requires high accuracy in order to control both the concentration and separation of charged species. In addition, the Polymerase Chain Reaction requires both accuracy (homogeneous temperature) and integration to carry out demanding heating cycles. The spectrum of applications requiring temperature regulation is growing rapidly with increasingly important implications for the physical, chemical and biotechnological sectors, depending on the relevant heating technique.},

Functional testing is needed to detect fluidic malfunctions. Such tests ensure whether or not, the elementary fluidic operations, such as droplet transportation, mixing, incubation, and splitting are reliably executed on the microfluidic array. Routing test and mixing/splitting test are two important steps in functional testing. We present two procedures for optimal bidirectional routing test and accelerated mixing/splitting test. Compared to previous methods, these procedures need significantly fewer droplet manipulation steps and reduced execution time. The proposed method of functional testing in an N {\texttimes} N microfluidic array requires only a constant number of mixing/splitting steps. Further, the test outcome is free from boundary errors related to droplet size that may arise during mixing/splitting test.},

  abstract = {In many biochemical protocols, sample preparation is an extremely important step for mixing multiple reagents in a given ratio. Dilution of a biochemical sample/reagent is the special case of mixing or solution preparation where only two fluids (sample and buffer) are mixed at a certain ratio corresponding to the desired concentration factor. Many bioassays often require multiple concentration values of the same sample/reagent, and implementing them efficiently on a digital microfluidic biochip is a challenge. In this paper, we present an algorithmic solution for the problem of producing a set of different target droplets in a minimum number of mix-split steps, and satisfying a given upper bound in concentration error. Unlike prior methods, this approach does not require any intermediate storage. We represent the underlying search space using a binary de Brujin graph and show that a shortest mix-split sequence can be obtained by solving an asymmetric traveling salesman problem therein. Simulation results over a large data set reveal that the proposed technique outperforms existing methods in terms of the number of mix-split steps, waste droplets, and reactant usage. The method is applicable in general scenarios of either one mixer or more mixers on the chip. A digital microfluidic platform can be easily designed to implement such a technique for rapid on-chip sample preparation.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidics (DMF) represents an alternative to the conventional microfluidic paradigm of transporting fluids in enclosed channels. One of the major benefits of DMF is that fluid motion and control is achieved without external pumps. The automation component of DMF have pushed the barriers of this ``lab-on-chip'' technology. However, integration with external components (i.e., ``worldto-chip'') interfaces have been a challenge. Two common ``world-to-chip'' challenges are (1) delivering biological samples to DMF devices and (2) accurately controlling temperatures on device. To address these challenges, this work describes two ``world-to-chip'' interface features that have been integrated on a DMF platform: a reagent delivery system and a thermal control apparatus. This platform enables a variety of biological or chemical experiments to be conducted on-chip while reducing manual intervention. Specifically, our platform increases reagent volumes available to device reservoirs volume by at least 50-fold eliminating the need to manually refill reservoirs while improving droplet dispensing reproducibility. In addition, we have integrated a closed-loop temperature control system that offers precise temperature control on-chip. To validate our ``world-to-chip'' interface, we have automated bacterial transformation and enzymatic assay protocols, showing that such a system enhances DMF performance. Overall, we propose that this system will improve biological experimentation which requires fluidic and temperature control integrated on DMF platforms.},

To allow single substrate type EWODs to be practically used in an automatic operation system, we developed a dimple structure as a key technique for a highly accurate droplet manipulation method. The three-dimensional shape of the dimple structure is embossed onto a disposable thin sheet. In this study, we confirmed that the dimple structure can suppress unintended droplet motion caused by unidentified factors. In addition, the stability of the droplets on the dimple structures was evaluated using a sliding experiment. On a flat substrate, the success rate of a droplet motion was lower than 70.8\%, but on the dimple structure, the droplets were able to be moved along the dimple structures correctly without unintended motion caused by several environmental conditions. These results indicated that the dimple structure increased the controllability of the droplets. Hence, the dimple structure will contribute to the practical application of digital microfluidics based on single substrate type EWODs.},

This platform integrates microfluidic technology with electrical impedance sensing and embodies a unique two-chamber architecture in which the capture/reaction and detection steps are physically separated from one another. This two-chamber design is a deviation from traditional proteomic biosensors and offers the potential for greater sensitivity as the capture/reaction and detection steps can be independently optimized. We demonstrate the implementation and feasibility of this platform in assaying both protein abundance, using the human cytokine interleukin 6, and activity, using Abelson tyrosine kinase.           ,              Global studies of the human proteome have revealed a plethora of putative protein biomarkers. However, their application for early disease detection remains at a standstill without suitable methods to realize their utility in the clinical setting. There thus continues to be tremendous interest in developing new technology for sensitive protein detection that is both low in cost and carries a small footprint to be able to be used at the point of care. The current gold standard method for protein biomarker detection is the ELISA, which measures protein abundance using bulky fluorescent scanners that lack portability. Here, we present a digital microfluidic platform for protein biomarker detection that is low in cost compared with standard optical detection methods, without any compromise in sensitivity. This platform furthermore makes use of simple electronics, enabling its translation into a portable handheld device, and has been developed in a manner that can easily be adapted to assay different types of proteomic biomarkers. We demonstrate its utility in quantifying not only protein abundance, but also activity. Interleukin-6 abundance could be assayed from concentrations as low as 50 pM (an order of magnitude lower than that detectable by a comparable laboratory designed ELISA) using less than 5 {$\mu$}L of sample, and Abelson tyrosine kinase activity was detectable in samples containing 100 pM of kinase.},

However, the complex data set from bioprocess, lagging cyberintegrated sensor system, and issues with storage scalability limit machine learning real-time application. Hence, it is imperative to know the state of technology to address prevailing issues. This review first gives an insight into the basic understanding of the machine learning domain and discusses its complexities for more comprehensive applications. Followed by an outline of how relevant machine learning models are for statistical and logical analysis of the enormous datasets generated to control bioprocess operations. Then this review critically discusses the current knowledge, its limitations, and future aspects in different subfields of the bio\- processing industry. Further, this review discusses the prospects of adopting a hybrid method to dovetail different modeling strategies, cyber-networking, and integrated sensors to develop new digital biotechnologies.},

In 2009, an ISO/CEN working group started with the revision of ISO 6579:2002 with two main aims: combining the three aforementioned standards in one document and improving the information in ISO 6579:2002. Additionally it was decided to split ISO 6579 into three parts, where part 1 describes the detection, part 2 the enumeration by mini-MPN (published in 2012) and part 3 the serotyping of Salmonella (published in 2014). This paper describes the experiments and choices made for improving the part on detection of Salmonella (ISO 6579-1). The final voting stage on (draft) ISO 6579-1 was finished by the end of December 2016, with a positive outcome. Finally, a real horizontal standard became available for detection of Salmonella in food, animal feed, environmental samples in the area of food production and food handling and in samples from the primary production stage in 2017.},

  abstract = {Micro total analytical systems (mTAS) are attractive to multiple fields that include chemistry, medicine and engineering due to their portability, low power usage, potential for automation, and low sample and reagent consumption, which in turn results in low waste generation. The development of fully-functional mTAS is an iterative process, based on the design, fabrication and testing of multiple prototype microdevices. Typically, microfabrication protocols require a week or more of highly-skilled personnel time in high-maintenance cleanroom facilities, which makes this iterative process cost-prohibitive in many locations worldwide. Rapid-prototyping tools, in conjunction with the use of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), enable rapid development of microfluidic structures at lower costs, circumventing these issues in conventional microfabrication techniques. Multiple rapid-prototyping methods to fabricate PDMSbased microfluidic devices have been demonstrated in literature since the advent of soft-lithography in 1998; each method has its unique advantages and drawbacks. Here, we present a tutorial discussing current rapid-prototyping techniques to fabricate PDMS-based microdevices, including softlithography, print-and-peel and scaffolding techniques, among other methods, specifically comparing resolution of the features, fabrication processes and associated costs for each technique. We also present thoughts and insights towards each step of the iterative microfabrication process, from design to testing, to improve the development of fully-functional PDMS-based microfluidic devices at faster rates and lower costs.},

Moreover, the dependency of the capacitance on the geometrical properties of interdigital capacitor structure, electrical properties of the structure as well as those of the human biological tissue are being examined in this project. Production of a sensor based on capacitive sensing, which can be used for the non-invasive approach of blood glucose monitoring is the main target of this paper.

  abstract = {A photovoltaic system is one of the major sources of renewable energy. The grid-connected inverter controllers play an important role in the conversion and transmission of solar energy. Therefore, they must be improved to meet the demands for grid interconnection. This article introduces the design and hardware implementation of the intelligent fuzzy-PI controller of the inverter part of the grid-connected photovoltaic system. First, the paper discusses the design of the three-phase gridconnected fuzzy-PI controller. Next, the paper describes the implementation of a Matlab graphical user interface (GUI) to design any grid-connected inverter and size the photovoltaic systems. The code generation of the fuzzy-PI controller of the system is accomplished by using Matlab Simulink simulation software. The hardware components of the PV system are implemented experimentally. In the hardware implementation, a 70 W prototype is realized to test the functionality of the controller, such that one can develop a realistic controller without taking risks or falling into security concerns in the case of performing experiments on high-power systems. The prototype proves that the controller model can be directly transformed from Simulink to the control device. It also shows that the fuzzy-PI controller is working properly in the 70-watt prototype. The achieved performance parameters of the proposed fuzzy-PI controller are satisfactory. The proposed method to design and implement the fuzzy-PI controller does not require complicated programming, where a Matlab coder is proposed to transform the Simulink controller into C code that can be directly utilized as a software control program loaded in the microcontrollers embedded in the hardware of the controller. The main result is that the fuzzy-PI controller for the three-phase grid-connected systems can be implemented using low-cost reconfigurable microcontrollers.},

  abstract = {A digital electrode array, on which drops of solvent can be electronically manipulated, allows automated steroid extraction from tiny tissue samples for diagnosis or research.           ,              Extracting Estrogen from Small Samples             Microfluidic devices, in which small samples are manipulated within narrow channels, have been profitably applied to clinical sample analysis and biomedical research. These devices have advantages over more standard analysis techniques because they require only limited amounts of reagents, a boon when reagents are expensive. In addition, microfluidic devices are easy to make and can handle multiple processes and multiple samples on a single platform, enabling automation and scale-up.                            In closely related digital microfluidic (DMF) devices, the usual channels through which liquids are pumped or electrically coaxed are replaced by arrays of flat electrodes. When an electrical potential is applied to an electrode, the surface becomes locally charged, such that the droplet moves to that region. When several electrodes are charged, one by one, droplets can be made to move across the surface (and dispense and mix) in a controlled fashion. To be moveable, liquids must be slightly conductive or have dipole moment {$>$} 1; fortunately, most liquids fall into this category. This DMF technology has now been harnessed by Mousa               et al               . for extraction of the steroid estradiol from very small tissue or blood samples for ultimate quantitation.                                         Steroid hormones, which regulate essential reproductive and homeostatic functions in the human body, are routinely measured clinically in blood but not in tissue because of the large samples that would be required by current methods. Separation of steroids from other biological components is usually necessary for accurate measurements because these components often interfere with the assays. To enable measurement of estrogen in tissues or small samples of blood, Mousa               et al               . have used DMFs and built a device to extract estradiol from 1-{$\mu$}l samples.                          In their method, the biological sample is dried onto one of the electrodes and a lysing solvent is moved by application of electrical potential to the sample and dried. Then, a polar solvent moves to the sample, extracting soluble material, including steroids. The droplet containing the steroid (and other components) is then circulated within a pool of nonpolar solvent; many of the interfering compounds partition into the nonpolar liquid. The polar droplet, still containing the steroid, is moved out of the nonpolar solvent pool and dried on an electrode, ready for quantitation. For routine application, the extraction process will need to be linked to an automated measurement method.             A convenient technique for measuring estrogen in small amounts of breast tissue or tumor, for example, would allow testing whether failure to respond to therapy with selective estrogen receptor modulators such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors is a result of locally high estrogen concentrations in the tumor and whether breast cancer risk can be predicted by local estrogen concentrations. Further, androgen concentrations in the prostate could be measured to check their influences on cancer.           ,              Estrogen is a key hormone in human reproductive physiology, controlling ovulation and secondary sexual characteristics. In addition, it plays an important role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Indeed, estrogen receptor antagonists and aromatase inhibitors (which block estrogen biosynthesis) are primary drugs used for treatment and prevention in at-risk populations. Despite its importance, tissue concentrations of estrogen are not routinely measured because conventional techniques require large samples of biopsies for analysis. In response to this need, we have developed a digital microfluidic method and applied it to the extraction and quantification of estrogen in 1-microliter samples of breast tissue homogenate (as would be collected with fine-needle aspiration), as well as in whole blood and serum. This method may be broadly applicable to conditions requiring frequent analysis of hormones in clinical samples (for example, infertility and cancer).},

Applications range from `lab-on-a-chip' devices to adjustable lenses and new kinds of electronic displays. In the present article, we review the recent progress in this rapidly growing field including both fundamental and applied aspects. We compare the various approaches used to derive the basic electrowetting equation, which has been shown to be very reliable as long as the applied voltage is not too high. We discuss in detail the origin of the electrostatic forces that induce both contact angle reduction and the motion of entire droplets. We examine the limitations of the electrowetting equation and present a variety of recent extensions to the theory that account for distortions of the liquid surface due to local electric fields, for the finite penetration depth of electric fields into the liquid, as well as for finite conductivity effects in the presence of AC voltage. The most prominent failure of the electrowetting equation, namely the saturation of the contact angle at high voltage, is discussed in a separate section. Recent work in this direction indicates that a variety of distinct physical effects---rather than a unique one---are responsible for the saturation phenomenon, depending on experimental details. In the presence of suitable electrode patterns or topographic structures on the substrate surface, variations of the contact angle can give rise not only to continuous changes of the droplet shape, but also to discontinuous morphological transitions between distinct liquid morphologies. The dynamics of electrowetting are discussed briefly. Finally, we give an overview of recent work aimed at commercial applications, in particular in the fields of adjustable lenses, display technology, fibre optics, and biotechnology-related microfluidic devices.},

  abstract = {We have developed a multi-scale PDMS fabrication strategy that can straddle the length scales of hybrid integrated circuit (IC)/microfluidic chips. This approach allows multiple millimeter-scale ICs, with micrometer-scale fluid channels built directly above the IC's surface, to be incorporated into a centimeter-sized PDMS chip.           ,                             In recent years there has been great progress harnessing the small-feature size and programmability of integrated circuits (ICs) for biological applications, by building microfluidics directly on top of ICs. However, a major hurdle to the further development of this technology is the inherent size-mismatch between ICs ({\textasciitilde}mm) and microfluidic chips ({\textasciitilde}cm). Increasing the area of the ICs to match the size of the microfluidic chip, as has often been done in previous studies, leads to a waste of valuable space on the IC and an increase in fabrication cost ({$>$}100{\texttimes}). To address this challenge, we have developed a three dimensional PDMS chip that can straddle multiple length scales of hybrid IC/microfluidic chips. This approach allows millimeter-scale ICs, with no post-processing, to be integrated into a centimeter-sized PDMS chip. To fabricate this PDMS chip we use a combination of soft-lithography and laser micromachining. Soft lithography was used to define micrometer-scale fluid channels directly on the surface of the IC, allowing fluid to be controlled with high accuracy and brought into close proximity to sensors for highly sensitive measurements. Laser micromachining was used to create {\textasciitilde}50 {$\mu$}m vias to connect these molded PDMS channels to a larger PDMS chip, which can connect multiple ICs and house fluid connections to the outside world. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we built and demonstrated an in-flow magnetic cytometer that consisted of a 5 {\texttimes} 5 cm               2               microfluidic chip that incorporated a commercial 565 {\texttimes} 1145 {$\mu$}m               2               IC with a GMR sensing circuit. We additionally demonstrated the modularity of this approach by building a chip that incorporated two of these GMR chips connected in series.},

  abstract = {Here we show that separate modules fabricated using 3D printing technology can be easily assembled to quantitate the amount of nitric oxide released from endothelial cells following ATP stimulation.           ,                             Fabrication of microchip-based devices using 3D printing technology offers a unique platform to create separate modules that can be put together when desired for analysis. A 3D printed module approach offers various advantages such as file sharing and the ability to easily replace, customize, and modify the individual modules. Here, we describe the use of a modular approach to electrochemically detect the ATP-mediated release of nitric oxide (NO) from endothelial cells. Nitric oxide plays a significant role in the vasodilation process; however, detection of NO is challenging due to its short half-life. To enable this analysis, we use three distinct 3D printed modules: cell culture, sample injection and detection modules. The detection module follows a pillar-based wall-jet electrode design, where the analyte impinges normal to the electrode surface, offering enhanced sensitivity for the analyte. To further enhance the sensitivity and selectivity for NO detection the working electrode (100 {$\mu$}m gold) is modified by the addition of a 27 {$\mu$}m gold pillar and platinum-black coated with Nafion. The use of the pillar electrode leads to three-dimensional structure protruding into the channel enhancing the sensitivity by 12.4 times in comparison to the flat electrode (resulting LOD for NO = 210 nM). The next module, the 3D printed sample injection module, follows a simple 4-port injection rotor design made of two separate components that when assembled can introduce a specific volume of analyte. This module not only serves as a cheaper alternative to the commercially available 4-port injection valves, but also demonstrates the ability of volume customization and reduced dead-volume issues with the use of capillary-free connections. Comparison between the 3D printed and a commercial 4-port injection valve showed similar sensitivities and reproducibility for NO analysis. Lastly, the cell culture module contains electrospun polystyrene fibers with immobilized endothelial cells, resulting in 3D scaffold for cell culture. With the incorporation of all 3 modules, we can make reproducible ATP injections (               via               the 3-D printed sample injection module) that can stimulate NO release from endothelial cells cultured on a fibrous insert in the cell culture module which can then be quantitated by the pillar WJE module (0.19 {\textpm} 0.03 nM per cell,               n               = 27, 3 inserts analyzed each day, on 9 different days). The modular approach demonstrates the facile creation of custom and modifiable fluidic components that can be assembled as needed.},

  abstract = {The microfluidics field is at a critical crossroads. The vast majority of microfluidic devices are presently manufactured using micromolding processes that work very well for a reduced set of biocompatible materials, but the time, cost, and design constraints of micromolding hinder the commercialization of many devices. As a result, the dissemination of microfluidic technology---and its impact on society---is in jeopardy. Digital manufacturing (DM) refers to a family of computer-centered processes that integrate digital three-dimensional (3D) designs, automated (additive or subtractive) fabrication, and device testing in order to increase fabrication efficiency. Importantly, DM enables the inexpensive realization of 3D designs that are impossible or very difficult to mold. The adoption of DM by microfluidic engineers has been slow, likely due to concerns over the resolution of the printers and the biocompatibility of the resins. In this article, we review and discuss the various printer types, resolution, biocompatibility issues, DM microfluidic designs, and the bright future ahead for this promising, fertile field.},

Our present study aims to characterize and study droplet speed in a typical EWOD device. First, a practical droplet speed measurement method has been methodically demonstrated and some related velocity terms have been introduced. Next, influence of electrode shape on droplet speed has been studied and a new design to enhance droplet speed has been proposed and experimentally demonstrated. Instead of using square shaped electrodes, rectangular electrodes with smaller widths are used to actuate droplets. Additionally, different schemes of activating electrodes are studied and compared for the same applied voltage. The experiments show that a particular scheme of activating the array of rectangular electrodes enhances the droplet speed up to 100\% in comparison to the droplet speed in a conventional device with square shaped electrodes.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate a new technique of heating aqueous droplets on conventional EWOD electrodes by using highfrequency high-voltage AC signals. At high actuation frequencies (10--1000 kHz), the droplet temperature rises due to Joule heating from the ohmic currents inside the drop. Using this direct heating technique, we were able to achieve temperatures of 93--94 {$^\circ$}C, which is significant for several biochemical applications. The technique is studied extensively using experiments and modelling. Several performance parameters of this heating technique were compared with a standard microheater through experiments and simulation. For the presented technique, the substrate near the droplet was cooler in comparison to the microheater. This will reduce parasitic heating of nearby droplets. A comprehensive study regarding the optimization of the geometrical parameters and the capability to heat solutions to higher temperatures using lower voltage and higher frequency were also performed using simulations. As conventional EWOD electrodes are used for heating the liquid, separate microheaters are not required. This significantly simplifies design and allows us to heat any droplet at any location on the chip. This on demand reconfigurability of droplet heating is the primary benefit of this technique. To establish the abilities of our suggested method, two biochemical experiments were demonstrated.},

A stack of a dielectric layer (SU-8) and a hydrophobic layer (Teflon AF1600) deposited on the PCB complete the EWOD device. Technological processes have been refined and adapted in order to be compatible with the PCB substrate material while ensuring good adhesion as well satisfactory dielectric characteristics. Experimental results of contact angle measurements as a function of the applied voltage are in good agreement with the LippmannYoung equation. The system has been tested in ``closed'' EWOD configuration by dispensing 1 {\textmu}L of water and by driving the fluid over the array applying voltages in the range 15 V to 30 V to the control electrodes.},

Instead of assembling a second substrate to form a top plate---the common practice with all previous parallel-plate EWOD chips---the top plate is surface micromachined as a transparent thin-film membrane that forms a monolithic cavity having a gap height on the order of micrometers with excellent accuracy and uniformity. The membrane is embedded with EWOD driving electrodes and confines droplets against the device substrate to perform digital microfluidic operations. Two main attributes of the monolithic architecture that distinguish it from tradition methods are: (i) it enables excellent control of droplet dimensions down to the micrometer scale, and (ii) it does not require the typical alignment and assembly steps. Basic device functions such as creation and splitting are verified by EWOD actuation of {$\sim$}100 picoliter droplets surrounded by air or oil inside a 10 {$\mu$}m-high cavity. Additionally, flow focusing of droplets containing 5.3 {$\mu$}m beads demonstrates one example of the utilities afforded by monolithic fabrication.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whereas disease surveillance for infectious diseases such as rubella is important, it is critical to identify pregnant women at risk of passing rubella to their offspring, which can be fatal and can result in congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). The traditional centralized model for diagnosing rubella is cost-prohibitive in resource-limited settings, representing a major obstacle to the prevention of CRS. As a step toward decentralized diagnostic systems, we developed a proof-of-concept digital microfluidic (DMF) diagnostic platform that possesses the flexibility and performance of automated immunoassay platforms used in central facilities, but with a form factor the size of a shoebox. METHODS: DMF immunoassays were developed with integrated sample preparation for the detection of rubella virus (RV) IgG and IgM. The performance (sensitivity and specificity) of the assays was evaluated with serum and plasma samples from a commercial antirubella mixed-titer performance panel. RESULTS: The new platform performed the essential processing steps, including sample aliquoting for 4 parallel assays, sample dilution, and IgG blocking. Testing of performance panel samples yielded diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 100\% and 100\% for both RV IgG and RV IgM. With 1.8 â®L sample per assay, 4 parallel assays were performed in approximately 30 min with Ï½10\% mean CV. CONCLUSIONS: This proof of concept establishes DMFpowered immunoassays as being potentially useful for the diagnosis of infectious disease.},

  abstract = {Portable digital microfluidic serological immunoassays for measles and rubella were developed and evaluated in a remote setting.           ,              A fluid transition into the field                            Many point-of-care diagnostics rely on lateral flow assays or microfluidics; however, these methods generally cannot test multiple samples simultaneously. Ng               et al               . optimized inkjet-printed digital microfluidic (DMF) cartridges and a portable control system to perform serological immunoassays in remote settings. DMF devices use electrostatic forces to mix and separate reagents and samples in small droplets of fluids. The DMF system measured IgG antibodies for measles and rubella from human blood samples obtained from adults and children on-site in a refugee camp in Kenya. Four samples could be tested simultaneously, although DMF IgG detection was less sensitive and specific than laboratory-based ELISA testing of matched serum samples. The emergence of this field-compatible technology brings with it new tools for advancing global health.                        ,                             Serosurveys are useful for assessing population susceptibility to vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks. Although at-risk populations in remote areas could benefit from this type of information, they face several logistical barriers to implementation, such as lack of access to centralized laboratories, cold storage, and transport of samples. We describe a potential solution: a compact and portable, field-deployable, point-of-care system relying on digital microfluidics that can rapidly test a small volume of capillary blood for disease-specific antibodies. This system uses inexpensive, inkjet-printed digital microfluidic cartridges together with an integrated instrument to perform enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). We performed a field validation of the system's analytical performance at Kakuma refugee camp, a remote setting in northwestern Kenya, where we tested children aged 9 to 59 months and caregivers for measles and rubella immunoglobulin G (IgG). The IgG assays were determined to have sensitivities of 86\% [95\% confidence interval (CI), 79 to 91\% (measles)] and 81\% [95\% CI, 73 to 88\% (rubella)] and specificities of 80\% [95\% CI, 49 to 94\% (measles)] and 91\% [95\% CI, 76 to 97\% (rubella)] (measles,               n               = 140; rubella,               n               = 135) compared with reference tests (measles IgG and rubella IgG ELISAs from Siemens Enzygnost) conducted in a centralized laboratory. These results demonstrate a potential role for this point-of-care system in global serological surveillance, particularly in remote areas with limited access to centralized laboratories.},

The device performance for lab-on-a-chip applications was investigated by demonstrating four types of reactions. First, acid-based titration was introduced as a simple mixing reaction. Second, colorimetric detection of phos\- phate based on the molybdenum blue method was represented as a more complicated reaction. The fabricated device was able to determine the amount of phosphate in the concentration range of 10--100 ppm with \%RSD of color intensity of less than 5\%. Third, colorimetric detection of glucose using glucose oxidase was demonstrated as an enzymatic reaction. A linear range of 1--20 mM for determination of glucose was applied for measuring glucose in beverages with recovery percentages of glucose in the acceptable range of 89.6--106.8\%. Finally, multistep analysis of C-reactive protein (CRP) based on immunomagnetic separation was successfully demon\- strated on this proposed device. Therefore, the superhydrophobic gold-coated PDMS has shown its ability to be a simple platform for digital magnetofluidics for a variety of applications in the field of lab-on-a-chip technology.},

Microfluidic platforms that handle small amounts of liquid have been categorised as continuous-flow microfluidics and digital microfluidics. The first part of this paper discusses the recent advances of the two main and opposing applications of liquid handling in continuous-flow microfluidics: mixing and separation. Mixing and separation are essential steps in most lab-on-a-chip platforms, as sample preparation and detection are required for a variety of biological and chemical assays. The second part discusses the various digital microfluidic strategies, based on droplets and liquid marbles, for the manipulation of discrete microdroplets. More advanced digital microfluidic devices combining electrowetting with other techniques are also introduced. The applications of the emerging field of liquid-marble-based digital microfluidics are also highlighted. Finally, future perspectives on microfluidic liquid handling are discussed.},

  abstract = {This paper reports the results of theoretical and experimental investigations of reciprocating thermocapillary motion of a liquid plug in microchannels. A one-dimensional analytical model for the transport of micro plugs in a capillary was established. The model consists of a system of two transient one-dimensional equations: one for temperature spreading in the capillary wall and one for the dynamics of surface tension driven movement of the plug. Surface tension depends strongly on temperature. Thus, a transient temperature distribution leads to a gradient of surface stress across a liquid plug. This surface stress difference leads to the movement of the liquid plug. For the experimental investigation two heaters were used for the periodic temperature gradient. Each of the heaters was activated alternatively to induce the reciprocating motion of the liquid plug. For quantitative evaluation, the position of the plugs was captured and evaluated with a CCD camera. This paper focuses on analysing the results of this motion at different switching frequencies. The results show that the motion of the plug exhibits a chaotic characteristics at high switching frequencies. This actuation concept has potential applications in post-processing stages for droplet-based microfluidics. The chaotic motion can be explored for efficient mixing in microplugs.},

The motion of TENG can provide both driving power and control signal for the mini vehicle. The maximum load for this mini vehicle is 500 mg and its highest controllable velocity can reach 1 m/s. Freestanding TENG has shown excellent capability to manipulate microfluid. Under the drive of TENG, the minimum volume of the droplet can reach 70{\textasciitilde}80 nL, while the tiny droplet can freely move on both horizontal and vertical planes. Finally, another strategy for delivering nanoparticles to the designated position has also been demonstrated.

These capabilities are sought in applications that need tiny but accurate volume of liquid delivery at high flow rate. For this purpose, we mainly focused on geometry of electrodes and developed novel shapes and arrangements of electrodes in electrowetting on dielectric microfluidic device. To dispense liquid droplets in higher volume precision and consistency, a novel reservoir design named TCC reservoir is introduced. To reduce time to dispense a droplet, L-junction is developed. Y-junction is designed to split a droplet into two at the same speed as droplet dispensing speed by the L-junction, and hence increase the number of droplets arrive to the target area (i.e. at high frequency delivery).},

Hence, they are not always ideal for on-site food surveillance.},

Industry discharges and fertilizer run-off release ammonia into sewers and streams, overloading wastewater treatment plants and causing fish deaths in surface water such as rivers, sea and lakes. The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of the microfluidic paper-based device ({\textmu}PAD) for the quantification of ammonia in wastewater. The {\textmu}PAD fabricated had an oval-shaped pattern which was designed using CorelDraw software. The hydrophilic zones were created by printing a chromatographic paper with a Xerox wax printer (Xerox colorqube 8570). The modified version of the colorimetric method using Nessler reagent was combined with microfluidic technologies to create a low-cost monitoring system for detection of ammonia in wastewater. The method allows for ammonia determination in the range of 0--5 ppm (mg/L) with a limit of detection of 3.34 ppm. This study indicated that a {\textmu}PAD was successfully used to quantify the concentration of ammonia in wastewater.},

MSC products are heterogeneous and we therefore investigated whether acoustophoresis, an ultrasound-based separation technology, could be used for the label-free enrichment of functionally different MSC populations. Acoustophoresis uses an ultrasonic standing wave field in a microchannel that differentially affects the movement of cells depending on their acoustophysical properties, such as size, density, and compressibility. Human bone marrow (BM) MSCs were generated by standard adherent culture in xeno-free medium and separated by microchip acoustophoresis. MSCs with up to 20\% higher proliferation and 1.7-fold increased clonogenic potential were enriched in the side outlet of the chip compared to the input sample. These cells were significantly smaller (average diameter 14.5\,{\textpm}\,0.4~{$\mu$}m) compared to the center outlet fraction (average diameter 17.1\,{\textpm}\,0.6~{$\mu$}m) and expressed higher levels of genes related to proliferation and stem cell properties (               i.e               .,               Ki-67               [1.9-fold],               Nanog1               [6.65-fold],               Oct4               [2.9-fold], and               CXCL12               [1.8-fold],               n               ~=~3) in the side outlet compared to input. Fractions of MSCs in G               0               /G               1               cell cycle phase were significantly enriched in the side fraction and an up to 2.8-fold increase of cells in S/G               2               /M phases were observed in center fractions compared to side fractions and 1.3-fold increased compared to the input sample. Acoustophoresis did not compromise MSC phenotype, proliferation, clonogenic capacity, and viability (generally 87--98\%), nor did it affect differentiation or immunomodulatory capacities. These results demonstrate that label-free acoustic separation can enrich functionally different MSC subsets which can potentially be employed to produce better-defined stromal cell products from cultured MSCs. Hence, acoustophoresis is a potentially promising separation technology to provide improved cell products for research and possible future clinical use. {\copyright} 2020 The Authors.

This perspective covers solutions to embed sustainability at the R\&D and product development stages.           ,                             Single-use, disposable, point-of-care diagnostic devices carry great promise for global health, including meeting urgent needs for testing and diagnosis in places with limited laboratory facilities. Unfortunately, the production and disposal of single-use devices, whether in lateral flow assay, cartridges, cassettes, or lab-on-chip microfluidic format, also poses significant challenges for environmental and human health. Point-of-care devices are commonly manufactured from unsustainable polymeric materials derived from fossil sources. Their disposal often necessitates incineration to reduce infection risk, thereby creating additional release of CO               2               . Many devices also contain toxic chemicals, such as cyanide derivatives, that are damaging to environmental and human health if not disposed of safely. Yet, in the absence of government regulatory frameworks, safe and sustainable waste management for these novel medical devices is often left unaddressed. There is an urgent need to find novel solutions to avert environmental and human harm from these devices, especially in low- and middle-income countries where waste management infrastructure is often weak and where the use of point-of-care tests is projected to rise in coming years. We review here common materials used in the manufacture of single-use point-of-care diagnostic tests, examine the risks they pose to environmental and human health, and investigate replacement materials that can potentially reduce the impact of microfluidic devices on the production of harmful waste. We propose solutions available to point-of-care test developers to start embedding sustainability at an early stage in their design, and to reduce their non-renewable plastic consumption in research and product development.},

Although sensitive screening and detection methodologies based on common conventional techniques have been developed for Salmonella spp., their long turnaround time and strict legislative demands directs the researchers to develop more sensitive and rapid methods. Digital PCR has many potential advantages over its closest competitor, Real-Time PCR. It gives more accurate, sensitive, and precise results, especially for samples that contain low pathogen concentrations and shows more resistance against PCR inhibitors. In this study, we developed a droplet digital PCR screening methodology with a short pre-enrichment step. For this purpose, 25 g raw minced meat was subjected to Salmonella contamination, and following a very short 3 h enrichment step, bacterial isolation from 5 mL of sample was achieved. For the specific detection of the Salmonella spp., bipA gene region was selected as a better candidate. Subsequently, droplet digital PCR setup was performed and detection sensitivity of the test was determined as 1.39 cfu/mL. Furthermore, parallel experiments were also conducted using Real-Time PCR, for comparative and validative purposes. Conclusively, data gathered in this study have shown that droplet digital PCR with our proposed setup can sensitively detect Salmonella spp. in raw minced meat samples while generating the same-day results.},

Most outbreaks are caused by Salmonella Enteritidis, present in contaminated food products, particularly in egg and egg products. In recent years, an increase in the prevalence of Salmonella in laying hen flocks in the EU has been observed. For the effective control of infection, adequate detection is key. In laying hen flocks, the occurrence of Salmonella in the EU is monitored by the culture of environmental samples (dust, faeces, and boot swabs). The performance of sampling procedures described in the literature for the detection of Salmonella in laying hens was reviewed. In total, 924 abstracts were screened, resulting in the selection of 87 abstracts and 18 publications for qualitative and quantitative analyses, respectively. Sample sizes and sampling locations of faecal material and dust were variable and poorly described. Microbiological culture methods used to detect Salmonella were variably described in the literature and were often incomplete. Overall, the available literature indicates higher sensitivity of environmental versus individual hen matrices and points to differences in sensitivity between environmental matrices. For non-cage housing systems, boot swabs are the preferred samples, while for cage housing systems dust might be a more reliable sample.},

Such systems will bring advantages such as low cost, high throughput and device portability to on-site determinations.

The static contact angle decreases significantly when voltage is applied between the droplet and the electrode: from 145{$^\circ$} down to 50{$^\circ$} (with DC voltage) and 15{$^\circ$} (with AC voltage). The electrowetting curves (contact angle versus voltage) are similar to the ones obtained in other solid/liquid/vapor and solid/liquid/ liquid systems: symmetric with respect to zero voltage and correctly described by Young-Lippmann equation below saturation. The reversibility is excellent and contact angle hysteresis is minimal ({$\sim$}2{$^\circ$}). The step size used in applying the DC voltage and the polarity of the voltage are unimportant. The saturation contact angle cannot be predicted with the simple zero-interfacial tension theory. Spreading (after applying a DC voltage) and retraction (after switching off the voltage) of the droplet is monitored. The base area of the droplet varies exponentially during wetting (exponential saturation) and dewetting (exponential decay). The characteristic time is 20 ms for spreading and 35 ms for retraction (such asymmetry is not observed with water-glycerol mixtures of a similar viscosity). The spreading kinetics (dynamic contact angle versus contact line speed) can be described by the hydrodynamic model (Voinov's equation) for small contact angles and by the molecular-kinetic model (Blake's equation) for large contact angles. The role of viscous and molecular dissipation follows the scheme outlined by Brochard-Wyart and de Gennes.},

These chips are also known as digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs). In this work, initially we have presented a study on the effect of external actuation voltage in various parameters like transport velocity and contact angles during droplet movement on DMFB, in the realm of surface hysteresis. Next, a greedy heuristic method is adopted in conjunction with droplet velocity lookup under varying range of voltage actuation to perform improved droplet routing on digital microfluidic biochips. Here a specified routing time, termed as latest arrival time (LAT) is calculated in an ideal case, without considering practical electrowetting effects. Then a stepwise voltage increment is performed through the droplet routing paths to reach the specified target location in time. Goal of the proposed method is to achieve a specified routing time for all the droplets towards their destinations. Experimental analysis ascertains the suitability of this technique in enhancing the throughput of an LOC in terms of transport time reduction, and elimination of any failed net during routing.},

Electrowetting is the change in contact angle of a liquid relative to its equilibrium value upon application of a potential bias. The phenomenon, being identified almost a century ago, is fundamentally an electrochemical process. However, the majority of the most recent research in this area focuses on electrowetting from the ``applications'' perspective. Device-based electrowetting uses substrates with insulating overlayers to eliminate charge transfer at the solid{\textbar}liquid interface and hence suppress the electrochemical character of the overall process. In this short review, we focus on electrowetting directly on conductors and discuss the purely electrochemical aspects of the phenomenon along with the open questions related to this rejuvenated topic.},

  abstract = {Wetting of carbon surfaces is one of the most widespread, yet poorly understood, physical phenomena. Control over wetting properties underpins the operation of aqueous energystorage devices and carbon-based filtration systems. Electrowetting, the variation in the contact angle with an applied potential, is the most straightforward way of introducing control over wetting. Here, we study electrowetting directly on graphitic surfaces with the use of aqueous electrolytes to show that reversible control of wetting can be achieved and quantitatively understood using models of the interfacial capacitance. We manifest that the use of highly concentrated aqueous electrolytes induces a fully symmetric and reversible wetting behavior without degradation of the substrate within the unprecedented potential window of 2.8 V. We demonstrate where the classical ``Young-Lippmann'' models apply, and break down, and discuss reasons for the latter, establishing relations among the applied bias, the electrolyte concentration, and the resultant contact angle. The approach is extended to electrowetting at the liquid{\textbar}liquid interface, where a concentrated aqueous electrolyte drives reversibly the electrowetting response of an insulating organic phase with a significantly decreased potential threshold. In summary, this study highlights the beneficial effect of highly concentrated aqueous electrolytes on the electrowettability of carbon surfaces, being directly related to the performance of carbon-based aqueous energy-storage systems and electronic and microfluidic devices.},

We portray a vision of a fully reconfigurable microfluidic device, which can change its shape and function dynamically, thus allowing researchers to `put their hands' into a microscale experiment and enabling real-time decision making. We review existing technologies that can dynamically control microscale flows, suggest additional physical mechanisms that could be leveraged towards the goal of reconfigurable microfluidics, and call on the broad scientific community to join in this effort.},

The conventional laboratory-based diagnostics of microbes such as bacteria and viruses need bulky expensive experimental instruments and skilled personnel which limits their usage in resource-limited settings. The biosensors-based point-of-care (POC) diagnostics have shown huge potential to detect microbial pathogens in a faster, cost-effective, and user-friendly manner. The use of various transducers such as electrochemical and optical along with microfluidic integrated biosensors further enhances the sensitivity and selectivity of detection. Additionally, microfluidic-based biosensors offer the advantages of multiplexed detection of analyte and the ability to deal with nanoliters volume of fluid in an integrated portable platform. In the present review, we discussed the design and fabrication of POCT devices for the detection of microbial pathogens which include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. The electrochemical techniques and current advances in this field in terms of integrated electrochemical platforms that include mainly microfluidic- based approaches and smartphone and Internet-of-things (IoT) and Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoMT) integrated systems have been highlighted. Further, the availability of commercial biosensors for the detection of microbial pathogens will be briefed. In the end, the challenges while fabrication of POC biosensors and expected future advances in the field of biosensing have been discussed. The integrated biosensor-based platforms with the IoT/IoMT usually collect the data to track the community spread of infectious diseases which would be beneficial in terms of better preparedness for current and futuristic pandemics and is expected to prevent social and economic losses.},

In spite of recent advancement in microfluidic based POC devices, there are still rooms for development to realize rapid, automatic and cost-effective sample-to-result genetic analysis. In this study, we propose an integrated rotary microfluidic system that is capable of performing glass microbead based DNA extraction, loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), and colorimetric lateral flow strip based detection in a sequential manner with an optimized microfluidic design and a rotational speed control. Rotation directiondependent coriolis force and siphon valving structures enable us to perform the fluidic control and metering, and the use of the lateral flow strip as a detection method renders all the analytical processes for nucleic acid test simplified and integrated without the need of expensive instruments or human intervention. As a proof of concept for point-of-care DNA diagnostics, we identified the food-borne bacterial pathogen which was contaminated in water or milk. Not only monoplex Salmonella Typhimurium but also multiplex Salmonella Typhimurium and Vibrio parahaemolyticus were analysed on the integrated rotary genetic analysis microsystem with a limit of detection of 50 CFU in 80 min. In addition, three multiple samples were simultaneously analysed on a single device.

To facilitate sample preparation in POCT, various methods have been developed to operate microfluidic devices without complicated external pumping systems. In this review, we introduce an overview of user-friendly microfluidic devices for practical sample preparation in POCT, including self- and hand-operated microfluidic devices. Self-operated microfluidic devices exploit capillary force, vacuum-driven pressure, or gas-generating chemical reactions to apply pressure into microchannels, and hand-operated microfluidic devices utilize human power sources using simple equipment, including a syringe, pipette, or simply by using finger actuation. Furthermore, this review provides future perspectives to realize user-friendly integrated microfluidic circuits for wider applications with the integration of simple microfluidic valves.},

  abstract = {Liquid dispensing in small scale is typically done by using either automatic syringe pumps or manual operation with syringes or pipettes. The micro-dispensers, which can precisely transport a variety of droplet fluids in the {\textmu}L range, have received increasingly more attention in the area of lab-on-a-chip. In this paper, we present the design of a portable, efficient, accurate yet cost-effective micro-dispenser, which is ideal for improving simple laboratory applications. Our proposed design is comprised of the main frame and a disposable main tank for accommodating a bulk volume of sample fluid. The whole unit functions as an off-chip reservoir to transport the sample fluid to elsewhere through a passive valve. The height of the disposable main tank and the diameter of the passive valve are carefully designed upon the physical properties of the sample fluid. Moreover, our micro-dispenser is equipped with a flexible layer of elastic diaphragm. An electromagnetic actuator is utilized to produce push-pull force, while a Peltier thermoelectric device supported by a fuzzy logic controller is dedicated to controlling the temperature within the tank. The experimental measurements of our prototyped device exhibit that our proposed design features multiple advantages over the conventional methods, including repeatable dispensing, high accuracy, disposability, and controllable temperature.},

Health expert's estimate that the yearly cost of all the food borne diseases is approximately \$5--6 billion. Traditional methodologies for salmonella analysis provide high reliability and very low limits of detection. Among them immunoassays and Nucleic acid-based assays provide results within 24 h, but they are expensive, tedious and time consuming. So, there is an urgent need for development of rapid, robust and cost-effective alternative technologies for real-time monitoring of salmonella. Several biosensors have been designed and commercialized for detection of this pathogen in food and water. In this overview, we have updated the literature concerning novel biosensing methods such as various optical and electrochemical biosensors and newly developed nano- and micro-scaled and aptamers based biosensors for detection of salmonella pathogen. Furthermore, attention has been focused on the principal concepts, applications, and examples that have been achieved up to diagnose salmonella. In addition, commercial biosensors and foreseeable future trends for onsite detecting salmonella have been summarized.},

Microfluidic chip has numerous points of interest including lesser time and reagent utilization and alongside this, it can execute numerous activities simultaneously. The miniatured size of the chip fastens the reaction as the surface area increases. It is utilized in different biomedical applications such as food safety sensing, peptide analysis, tissue engineering, medical diagnosis, DNA purification, PCR activity, pregnancy, and glucose estimation.

The system features end-to-end automation, with integrated thermal control for digestion, optimized droplet additives for sample manipulation and analysis, and an automated interface to liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Dimethyl labeling was integrated into the pipeline to allow for relative quantification of the trace samples at the nanogram level, and the new pipeline was applied to evaluating cancer cell lines and cancer tissue samples. Several known proteins (including HSP90AB1, HSPB1, LDHA, ENO1, PGK1, KRT18, and AKR1C2) and pathways were observed between model breast cancer cell lines related to hormone response, cell metabolism, and cell morphology. Furthermore, differentially quantified proteins (such as PGS2, UGDH, ASPN, LUM, COEA1, and PRELP) were found in comparisons of healthy and cancer breast tissues, suggesting potential utility of the All-in-One pipeline for the emerging application of proteomic cancer sub-typing.

The electrodes are biased by converting mechanical energy into electrical energy using an array of piezoelectric elements.           ,                             We report a finger-powered digital microfluidic device based on the electrophoretic transport of discrete droplets (EPD). An array of piezoelectric elements is connected in parallel to metal electrodes immersed in dielectric fluids. When deflected in a controlled sequence               via               human finger power, the piezoelectric elements charge and actuate droplets across each electrode pair through electrophoretic force. Successful droplet transportation requires the piezoelectric elements to provide both sufficient charge and voltage pulse duration. We quantify these requirements using numerical models to predict the electrical charges induced on the droplets and the corresponding electrophoretic forces. The models are experimentally validated by comparing the predicted and measured droplet translational velocities. We successfully demonstrated transport and merging of aqueous droplets over a range of droplet radii (0.6--0.9 mm). We further showed direct manipulation of body fluids, including droplets of saliva and urine, using our finger-powered EPD device. To facilitate practical implementation of multistep assays based on the approach, a hand/finger-rotated drum system with a programmable pattern of protrusions is designed to induce deflections of multiple piezoelectric elements and demonstrate programmable fluidic functions. An electrode-to-piezoelectric element connection scheme to minimize the number of piezoelectric elements necessary for a sequence of microfluidic functions is also explored. The present work establishes an engineering foundation to enable design and implementation of finger-powered portable EPD microfluidic devices.},

  abstract = {Digital (droplet-based) microfluidic technology offers an attractive platform for implementing a wide variety of biochemical laboratory protocols, such as point-of-care diagnosis, DNA analysis, target detection, and drug discovery. A digital microfluidic biochip consists of a patterned array of electrodes on which tiny fluid droplets are manipulated by electrical actuation sequences to perform various fluidic operations, for example, dispense, transport, mix, or split. However, because of the inherent uncertainty of fluidic operations, the outcome of biochemical experiments performed on-chip can be erroneous even if the chip is tested a priori and deemed to be defect-free. In this article, we address an important error recoverability problem in the context of sample preparation. We assume a cyberphysical environment, in which the physical errors, when detected online at selected checkpoints with integrated sensors, can be corrected through recovery techniques. However, almost all prior work on error recoverability used checkpointing-based               rollback               approach, that is, re-execution of certain portions of the protocol starting from the previous checkpoint. Unfortunately, such techniques are expensive both in terms of assay completion time and reagent cost, and can never ensure full error-recovery in deterministic sense. We consider imprecise droplet mix-split operations and present a novel               roll-forward               approach where the erroneous droplets, thus produced, are used in the error-recovery process, instead of being discarded or remixed. All erroneous droplets participate in the dilution process and they mutually cancel or reduce the concentration-error when the target droplet is reached. We also present a rigorous analysis that reveals the role of volumetric-error on the concentration of a sample to be prepared, and we describe the layout of a lab-on-chip that can execute the proposed cyberphysical dilution algorithm. Our analysis reveals that fluidic errors caused by unbalanced droplet splitting can be classified as being either               critical               or               non-critical               , and only those of the former type require correction to achieve error-free sample dilution. Simulation experiments on various sample preparation test cases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Efficient actuation of liquid slugs in microfluidic circuits is a matter of interest in droplet-based microfluidic applications. In this paper, the Electrowetting On Dielectric (EWOD) actuation of a liquid slug fully confined in a microchannel is studied. A set of experiments are conducted in which the mean transport velocity of a liquid slug enclosed in a microchannel of rectangular cross section and actuated by EWOD method is measured. A printed circuit board based (PCB-based) microfluidic chip is used as the platform, and the transport velocity of the slug is measured by processing the images recorded by a high-speed camera while the slug moves in the channel. To investigate the effect of microchannel geometry on the mean transport velocity of the slugs, different channel heights and widths (ranging between 250 àµ 440 Ýß¤ and 1-2 mm, respectively) as well as different liquid volumes (ranging between 2.94 àµ 5.15 Ü®ß¤ ) are tested and slug velocities up to 14.9 mm/s are achieved. A theoretical model is also developed to analyze the effect of involved parameters on the transport velocity. The results show that, within the range of design parameters considered in this study, for a constant slug volume and channel width, increasing the channel height enhances the velocity. Moreover, keeping the slug volume and channel height fixed, the transport velocity is increased by enlarging the channel width. An inverse proportionality between the slug length and velocity is also observed. These results are also shown to agree with the theoretical model developed.},

  abstract = {Environmental pollution and its drastic effects on human and animal health have urged governments to implement strict policies to minimize damage. The first step in applying such policies is to find reliable methods to detect pollution in various media, including water, food, soil, and air. In this regard, various approaches such as spectrophotometric, chromatographic, and electrochemical techniques have been proposed. To overcome the limitations associated with conventional analytical methods, microfluidic devices have emerged as sensitive technologies capable of generating high content information during the past few years. The passage of contaminant samples through the microfluidic channels provides essential details about the whole environment after detection by the detector. In the meantime, artificial intelligence is an ideal means to identify, classify, characterize, and even predict the data obtained from microfluidic systems. The development of microfluidic devices with integrated machine learning and artificial intelligence is promising for the development of nextgeneration monitoring systems. Combination of the two systems ensures time efficient setups with easy opera\- tion. This review article is dedicated to the recent developments in microfluidic chips coupled with artificial intelligence technology for the evolution of more convenient pollution monitoring systems.},

Many chemists acquire and utilize skills that are well beyond the traditional definition of chemistry. The digital age has transformed chemistry laboratories. One aspect of this transformation is the progressing implementation of electronics and computer science in chemistry research. In the past decade, numerous chemistry-oriented studies have benefited from the implementation of electronic modules, including microcontroller boards (MCBs), single-board computers (SBCs), professional grade control and data acquisition systems, as well as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In particular, MCBs and SBCs provide good value for money. The application areas for electronic modules in chemistry research include construction of simple detection systems based on spectrophotometry and spectrofluorometry principles, customizing laboratory devices for automation of common laboratory practices, control of reaction systems (batch- and flow-based), extraction systems, chromatographic and electrophoretic systems, microfluidic systems (classical and nonclassical), custom-built polymerase chain reaction devices, gas-phase analyte detection systems, chemical robots and drones, construction of FPGA-based imaging systems, and the Internet-of-Chemical-Things. The technology is easy to handle, and many chemists have managed to train themselves in its implementation. The only major obstacle in its implementation is probably one's imagination.},

  abstract = {Rapid screening of pathogenic bacteria contaminated foods is crucial to prevent food poisoning. However, available methods for bacterial detection are still not ready for in-field screening because culture is timeconsuming; PCR requires complex DNA extraction and ELISA lacks sensitivity. In this study, a microfluidic biosensor was developed for rapid, sensitive and automatic detection of Salmonella using metal-organic frame\- work (MOF) NH2-MIL-101(Fe) with mimic peroxidase activity to amplify biological signal and Raspberry Pi with self-developed App to analyze color image. First, the target bacteria were separated and concentrated with the immune magnetic nanobeads (MNBs), and labeled with the immune MOFs to form MNB-Salmonella-MOF com\- plexes. Then, the complexes were used to catalyze colorless o-phenylenediamine and H2O2 to produce yellow 2,3-diaminophenazine (DAP). Finally, the image of the catalysate was collected under the narrow-band blue light and analyzed using the Raspberry Pi App to determine the bacterial concentration. The experimental results showed that this biosensor was able to detect Salmonella Typhimurium from 1.5 {\texttimes} 101 to 1.5 {\texttimes} 107 CFU/mL in 1 h with the lower detection limit of 14 CFU/mL. The mean recovery for Salmonella in spiked chicken meats was {\textasciitilde}112\%.

However, due to the limitation of electrodes number, the throughput is hard to further upgrade. Therefore, active matrix electrowetting-on-dielectric (AM-EWOD) technology is a solution to acquire larger scale of driving electrodes. However, the process of manufacturing of AM-EWOD based on thin-film-transistor (TFT) is complex and expensive. Besides, the driving voltage of DMF chip is usually much higher than that of common display products.In this paper, a solution for mass production of AM-EWOD based on amorphous silicon (a-Si) is provided. Samples of 32 {\texttimes} 32 matrix AM-EWOD chips was designed and manufactured. A boost circuit was integrated into the pixel, which can raise the pixel voltage up by about 50\%. Customized designed Printed Circuit Board (PCB) was used to supply the timing signals and driving voltage to make the motion of droplets programmable. The process of moving, mixing and generation of droplets was demonstrated.The minimum voltage in need was about 20 V and a velocity of up to 96 mm/s was achieved. Such an DMF device with large-scale matrix and low driving voltage will be very suitable for POCT applications.},

This study reported a deep learning enhanced digital microfluidic platform for multiplex detection of viable foodborne pathogens. The new method used a Time-Lapse images driven EfficientNet-Transformer Network (TLENTNet) to type and quantify the bacteria through spatiotemporal features of bacterial growth and digital enumeration of bacterial culture. First, the bacterial sample was prepared with LB medium and injected into a pre-vacuumed microfluidic chip with an array of 800 microwells to encapsulate at most one bacterium in each well. Then, a programmed sliding microscopic platform was used to scan all microwells every 15 min, capturing time-lapse images of bacterial growth within each microwell. Finally, the TLENTNet was used to facilitate bacterial typing and quantification. Under optimal conditions, this platform was able to detect four bacterial species (S. typhimurium, E. coli O157:H7, S. aureus and B. cereus) with an average accuracy of 97.72\% and a detection limit of 63 CFU/mL in 7 h.},

  abstract = {Buffer liquids currently used in biotechnology contain surfactants. These surfactants modify the wetting properties of the liquid and affect the behavior of droplets in electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) microsystems. An analysis of the effect of surfactants in EWOD-based microsystems, at equilibrium and in a non-equilibrium state, is given here. First, a reference for the value of the surface tension and its time variation is obtained by the use of the pendant drop method, showing that the time variation of the surface tension follows a decreasing exponential law. Next, equilibrium experiments have been performed on a specially designed EWOD experimental microsystem. It has been observed that the Lippmann--Young theoretical equation for electrowetting is satisfied at equilibrium, even in the presence of surfactants. However, at the CMC, equilibrium surface tension values are different from those obtained by the pendant drop method. This difference is explained by an internal convective motion that remixes the surfactants. This internal motion is observed by following the motion of fluorophores. Consequently, surfactant concentrations about ten times the CMC are required to obtain the same values of the surface tension in the pendant drop method and by EWOD measurements. In a second section, it is shown that the behavior of surfactant-loaded droplets in EWOD-based microsystems can be explained by considering that the surface tension relaxes with time according to the exponential law found in the first section.},

Heavy metals, pharmaceuticals waste, organic, and inorganic contami\- nants present in wastewater have shown significant threats to the environment and public health globally. Currently available monitoring techniques involve complex equipment, longer processing time, and highly skilled professionals, making these techniques inadequate. Towards achieving a portable, highly sensitive, and selective water quality control system, microfluidic devices have emerged as the technique for the need of the hour. Several researchers have turned their attention to the microfluidic devices and have been doing extensive research on the development and application of microfluidic-based devices for the detection of water contam\- inants. Considering the fact that microfluidic devices have already marking an impact in this field, this review article discusses latest development on the microfluidic-based water quality control devices.

The onset of actuation and droplet mobility on electrode arrays have been investigated. The numerical method is based on volume of fluid technique to track the 3-D interface along with a Laplace equation solver to calculate the electric field in the domain. Furthermore, the dynamic behaviour of three-phase contact line is modeled using molecular-kinetic theory. Validation experiments were carried out to characterize the droplet actuation by various electrode shapes. The superior performance of the new electrode shape is demonstrated by comparing the droplet velocity and deformation, as well as contact angle distribution of those of a simple flat electrode.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) are designed to efficiently carry out biochemical and biomedical analysis in a miniaturized way. DMFBs offer various advantages over traditional laboratory techniques and reduces cost, and increases automation and software programmability. Scheduling of microfluidic operations is the first and essential step in the fluidic-level synthesis of DMFBs, while the other two are the module placement and droplet routing. Scheduling DMFB operations is a multiconstrained optimization problem, and the particular decision problem is NP-complete. We propose a hybrid artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm using generalized N-point crossover (GNX) based scheduling of DMFB operations. Proposed ABC-GNX perturbs through search space, evaluates various schedules possible, and returns the best schedule among the evaluated schedules. Simple list scheduling based heuristic algorithms can explore a single schedule based on the sequence generated by the priority function. Iterative improvement based search algorithms explore the search space and evaluate more schedules, but the proposed ABC-GNX algorithm produces optimal solutions in shorter execution times. Simulation results show that the proposed ABC-GNX produces a higher number of optimal completion times and faster execution times than existing algorithms.},

Combining advanced biological detection methods (e.g., nucleic acid-based or immunology-based protocols) with microfluidics and immunomagnetic separation techniques that exploit functionalized magnetic particles has tremendous potential for realization of an integrated system for pathogen detection, in particular, of waterborne pathogens. Taking advantage of the unique properties of magnetic particles, faster, more sensitive, and more economical diagnostic assays can be developed that can assist in the battle against microbial pathogenesis. In this review, we highlight current technologies and methods used for realization of magnetic particle-based microfluidic integrated waterborne pathogen isolation and detection systems, which have the potential to comply in future with regulatory water quality monitoring requirements.},

Two main approaches exist to induce Dielectrophoresis (DEP) on suspended particles, i.e., electrode-based DEP and insulator-based DEP, each featuring different advantages and disadvantages. However, a shared concern lies in the input voltage used to generate the electric field necessary for DEP to take place. Therefore, input voltage can determine portability of a microfluidic device.

Modifications to the underlying surface structure can be used to passively control the direction of droplet movement, and the careful selection of responsive solid substrates and/or overlying liquids can allow active control through induced temperature gradients, electrical stimulation, and exposure to magnetic fields. Recent work leveraging other advantages of liquid-infused systems such as ultra-low friction, noncoalescence of droplets, and liquid--liquid patterning has demonstrated the unique ways in which this approach can be used to both enhance current detection methods as well as enable new ones.

Sensors were historically used in order to maintain an optimal environment within the reactor to optimize process performance. However, technological innovation has pushed towards on-line in situ continuous monitoring of quality attributes that could previously only be estimated offline. These new sensing technologies when coupled with software models have shown promise for unique fingerprinting, smart process control, outcome improvement, and prediction. All this can be done without requiring invasive sampling or intervention on the system. In this paper, the state-of-the-art sensing technologies and their applications in the context of cell culture monitoring are reviewed with emphasis on the coming push towards industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing within the biopharmaceutical sector.

  abstract = {In this paper, rapid prototyping techniques for microfluidic master mold fabrication, using copper clads micromachining and 3D printing technologies are presented. Copper clad is a promising material for microfluidic mold fabrication due to its: smooth surface, availability of different copper and dielectric layer thicknesses, affordability and easiness of machining. In addition, 3D printing technology was investigated as a rapid prototyping technique to achieve appropriate master mold fabrication. Several molds with different channel features (width and height) were fabricated from each technique and were compared from the stand point of channel resolution, minimum space between channels, surface roughness, fabrication time and cost. Finally, microfluidic chips were fabricated using those molds by using molding technique based on Poly (dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). The collection of these techniques offers precise channel heights starting from 15 {$\mu$}m and different channel width ranging from 50 {$\mu$}m in a short time fabrication process (i.e. 5min), without needing clean room equipment for molds fabrication.},

This article presents a general view of miniaturized analytical systems, covering devices giving qualitative information. Qualitative information is more than the simple identification of compounds in samples, as the modern concept of qualitative analysis also includes the analytical information not represented by numbers (as is characteristic of quantitative analysis). Thus, classification of samples by screening methods, or the definition of an analytical profile of analytes in a sample, as diagnostic tests provide, must be viewed as a type of qualitative analysis. Following this concept of qualitative analysis, different miniaturized analytical approaches are described, as are future trends, pointing out advantages, disadvantages and challenges.},

Our approach consists in an interpretation of the differential signal produced by a pair of photodiodes connected head-to-tail due to the variations of illumination at the passage of a droplet. We checked the relevance of this zero-background method by comparing results to video measurements, and observed a very good agreement at rates up to the kHz range. Moreover, since the measured values are stored in a simple text file, flow characterization over very long times (several hours) becomes accessible. We applied this facility to perform three examples of longterm studies: stationary regimes, transient regimes, and the effect of an external forcing. Several unexpected features, like long-period fluctuations, can thus be evidenced.},

Little work has been done, however, to analyze the performance of droplet-based assays. This review aims to apply what is known in the literature to the analysis of the performance metrics of droplet-based assays, with specific relevance to diagnostic and biomedical applications based on two processes: enzymatic reactions and cell culture in droplets. By considering the physical scaling of individual processes---droplet generation, reaction kinetics, cell growth, and droplet interrogation---it is possible to extract a practical relationship between input parameters (e.g., droplet size and droplet polydispersity) and the output characteristics (e.g., throughput, dynamic range, and accuracy) of the assay. This review can serve as a guide to the design of droplet-based assays for achieving desired performance. While the focus is on assays based on enzymatic reactions and cell cultures, a similar analysis can be applied to other assays based on polymerase chain reaction and the detection of nucleic acids.},

Low power consumption, low sample and reagent volumes, small size, and rapid fluid transport are features of electrowetting microfluidic platforms that will enable the development of cost-effective, rapid time-to-result, and portable point-of-care diagnostic devices. Microresonator sensors are an excellent sensor technology for integration into these microfluidic systems, because they perform high sensitivity detection of proteins, DNA, and other biologically relevant molecules while tolerating a droplet oil encapsulation layer. This paper reports on a SU-8 polymer microresonator embedded in the top plate of the EWD system, which enables addressing of the sensor with a single droplet of {$<$} 100 nL in volume and enables droplets to be moved onto and off of the sensor. This system is the first to demonstrate analyte measurement by electrowetting actuation of droplets onto and off of a top plate integrated microresonator sensor. Both photolithographically patterned and electron beam lithographically patterned microresonator sensors were tested, and the effect of a conventional filler medium, silicone oil, on the sensor sensitivity was investigated.},

A Bdigital[ electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWD) microfluidics system with integrated optical sensors is a promising platform for portable POC diagnostic devices that integrate sample preparation with sensing. Herein is reported the highest sensitivity and figure of merit (FOM) microresonator sensor integrated with an EWD system to date [FOM is the product of the quality (Q) factor and the sensitivity (S)]. The EWD system embedded microresonator sensor had a measured FOM of 0:60 {\^A} 106 nm/RIU {\dh}Q {$\frac{1}{4}$} 8; 400; S {$\frac{1}{4}$} 72 nm/RIU{\TH} in 2-cSt silicone oil and water, which is nearly double the best FOM previously reported for an microresonator placed on top of an EWD system. Additionally, a nominal FOM of 1:2 {\^A} 106 nm/RIU {\dh}Q {$\frac{1}{4}$} 15 000; S {$\frac{1}{4}$} 82 nm/RIU{\TH} was measured for the vertically coupled sensor fabricated on a standard SiO2/Si substrate. This FOM is the highest reported to date for SU-8 microresonators probed at wavelengths around 1550 nm. These results indicate that high-performance polymer sensors can be integrated with low-power-consumption EWD microfluidics sample preparation systems toward the development of portable POC diagnostic devices.},

  abstract = {Potential applications of digital microfluidic (DMF) biochips now include several areas of real-life applications like environmental monitoring, water and air pollutant detection, and food processing to name a few. In order to achieve sufficiently high throughput for these applications, several instances of the same bioassay may be required to be executed concurrently on different samples. As a straightforward implementation, several identical biochips can be integrated on a single substrate as a               multichip               to execute the assay for various samples concurrently. Controlling individual electrodes of such a chip by independent pins may not be acceptable since it increases the cost of fabrication. Thus, in order to keep the overall pin-count within an acceptable bound, all the respective electrodes of these individual pieces are connected internally underneath the chip so that they can be controlled with a single external control pin. In this article, we present an orientation strategy for layout of a multichip that reduces routing congestion and consequently facilitates wire routing for the electrode array. The electrode structure of the individual pieces of the multichip may be either direct-addressable or pin-constrained. The method also supports a hierarchical approach to wire routing that ensures scalability. In this scheme, the size of the biochip in terms of the total number of electrodes may be increased by a factor of four by increasing the number of routing layers by only one. In general, for a multichip with 4                                n                              identical blocks, (               n               + 1) layers are sufficient for wire routing.},

Optical detection, processing and analysis are considered to be of major significance in bioassay operations as this may influence the conclusive decisions involving diagnosis, detection and testing. Detection results obtained from a series of tests in a single biochip --may prompt to perform next sequence of tests on separate biochips in order to converge towards specific disease profile, diagnosis and determination of the future course of treatment. In this paper we have first proposed a design of a digital detection analyzer circuit to be coupled with a biochip for execution of prescheduled multiple bioassay protocols. The analyzer enables automated detailed analysis of the optical detection results based on the data acquired at the detection site through successful Biochip operation for heterogeneous droplet samples. we further proposed a design of centralized controller that operates on the basis of the digitized output pattern obtained from the proposed analyzer for a specific test sequence and logically determines the address of the next biochip to perform the next test sequences destined in the diagnostic process flow using an intelligent database stored in the integrated system memory. The synthesis, simulation for the overall system has been carried out using precharacterized reference data for measurement of different parameters of human blood samples and corresponding final detection results are displayed and verified successfully.},

With the development of heterogeneous photonic component integration technologies it has become possible to integrate miniaturized optical sensing technologies with the Microfluidic systems. This enables complex optical detection functions to be incorporated within the microfluidic platform. In this paper we proposed a design of a digital microfluidic system that uses a feedback based detection and analysis technique using multiple homogeneous sample based detection analyzers. The analyzers are connected in a feedback loop to discrete Biochips for dedicated majority based detection on specified bioassays. The initial detection is carried out on different individual samples in a centralized digital microfluidic biochip. Based on the initial detection results for each sample feedback signals have been generated. Such signals are employed for initiatiation of independent confirmatory detection of lower degree of presence of targeted parameters on individual bioassays separately. The experiment has been carried out for Bioassays involving detection of blood Glucose, Lactate and Pyruvate. The simulation results for the design along with automated detection analysis results are found to be encouraging.},

With the development of heterogeneous photonic component integration technologies it has become possible to integrate miniaturized optical sensing technologies that enable complex optical detection functions to be incorporated within the microfluidic platform. In this paper we have proposed a novel design of dual mode droplet detection analyzer to be coupled with a targeted biochip for providing automated detailed analysis based on the data acquired through optical detection. The proposed design employed in two modes for both homogeneous and heterogeneous samples enables automated detection and analysis of different samples based on predefined characterized results . The architecture, synthesis and simulation of the proposed droplet analyzer for signals obtained for different bioassay protocols has been described in this paper --and the results are found to be quite encouraging.},

The technology aims at automation and integration of droplet based microfluidic operation within a miniaturized substrate comprised of 2D planar array of electrodes. Sample preparation remains a major issue for execution of specified bioassay protocols in DMFBs. This requires dilution of samples or formation of mixtures with different targeted concentration factors. Here, we propose new techniques for sample preparation with single source, multiple target concentration having linear dilution gradient for prespecified bioassay execution. The main objective is to i) minimize number of samples as well as reagents for obtaining targeted concentration ii) to employ minimum mixing or dilution operations and thereby optimizing the module utilization and iii) to obtain multiple copies of targeted concentration necessary for fault tolerance and parallel bioassay applications and iv) minimum generation of waste droplets to ensure optimum sample and module utilization.},

POC devices for pathogen detection have primarily contributed to clinical management in various applications such as pathology, drug discovery and food safety.

Among them, a few were developed as ready-to-use devices and are currently commercially available. In this review, we presented the most recent developments in diagnostic methods in pathogen detection and the improvements included in the detection steps in recent POCs for pathogen detection.

A digital microfluidic system typically consists of a planar array of cells with electrodes that control individual droplets of biological samples. Chemical analysis is performed by moving, mixing, and splitting of droplets. A major issue in biochip layout design is the coordination of simultaneous movement of multiple droplets. It involves the scheduling of movement of a number of droplets in a time-multiplexed manner to avoid their cross-contamination. In this paper we propose a clustering technique to achieve routing of maximum number of samples from a given set of sub-problems in the same planar array with intelligent collision avoidance. A new cluster-based route-aware placement technique is also proposed that enhances the performance of droplet routing, accommodating larger number of concurrently routed sub-problems in the same planar array. The objectives considered are minimizing the latest arrival time of droplets, total routing time of droplets and the overall cell utilization. Experimental simulation results obtained using testbenches for benchmark suite III are found to be better than the recent existing works.},

In digital microfluidics, especially in the electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) system, each droplet acts as an independent reactor, which enables a wide range of multiple parallel biological and chemical reactions at the microscale. EWOD digital microfluidics reduces reagent and energy consumption, accelerates analysis, enables point-of-care diagnostic, simplifies integration with sensors, etc. Such a digital microfluidic system is especially relevant for droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), thanks to its nanoliter droplets and well-controlled volume distribution. At low DNA concentration, these small volumes allow less than one DNA strand per droplet on average (limited dilution) so that after a fixed number of PCR cycles (endpoint PCR), only the DNA in droplets containing the sequence of interest has been amplified and can be detected by fluorescence to yield an accurate count of the sequences of interest using statistical models. Focusing on ddPCR, this article summarizes the latest development and research on EWOD technology for droplet PCR over the last decade.},

This method enables manipulation of droplets several times smaller than the electrode size and, importantly, minimizes evaporation, contamination, and exposure of the sample to high voltages. We demonstrate various modes of droplet loading, transporting, and unloading. Using advanced imaging processing techniques, we obtained detailed information about the shuttle and droplet centroids. Furthermore, varying water concentration on the soft shuttle allows for modulation of the diffusion kinetics of samples into the shuttle, which also can be controlled with soft shuttle actuation velocity. We believe that this novel approach for the manipulation of droplets will advance the field of droplet-based open microfluidics and can be potentially useful for applications in biotechnology, diagnostics, or analytical chemistry.},

  abstract = {Point-of-care testing (POCT) allows physicians to detect and diagnose diseases at or near the patient site, faster than conventional lab-based testing. The importance of POCT is considerably amplified in the trying times of the COVID-19 pandemic. Numerous point-of-care tests and diagnostic devices are available in the market including, but not limited to, glucose monitoring, pregnancy and infertility testing, infectious disease testing, cholesterol testing and cardiac markers. Integrating microfluidics in POCT allows fluid manipulation and detection in a singular device with minimal sample requirements. This review presents an overview of two technologies - (a.) Lateral Flow Assay (LFA) and (b.) Nucleic Acid Amplification - upon which a large chunk of microfluidic POCT diagnostics is based, some of their applications, and commercially available products. Apart from this, we also delve into other microfluidic-based diagnostics that currently dominate the               in-vitro               diagnostic (IVD) market, current testing landscape for COVID-19 and prospects of microfluidics in next generation diagnostics.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate a new approach to impedance measurement on digital microfluidics chips for the purpose of simple, sensitive, and accurate volume and liquid composition measurement. Adding only a single series resistor to existing AC droplet actuation circuits, the platform is simple to implement and has negligible effect on actuation voltage. To accurately measure the complex voltage across the resistor (and hence current through the device and droplet), the designed system is based on software-implemented lock-in amplification detection of the voltage drop across the resistor which filters out noise, enabling high-resolution and low-limit signal recovery. We observe picoliter sensitivity with linear correlation of voltage to volume extending to the microliter volumes that can be handled by digital microfluidic devices. Due to the minimal hardware, the system is robust and measurements are highly repeatable. The detection technique provides both phase and magnitude information of the real-time current flowing through the droplet for a full impedance measurement. The sensitivity and resolution of this platform enables it to distinguish between various liquids which, as demonstrated in this paper, could potentially be extended to quantify solute concentrations, liquid mixtures, and presence of analytes.},

Under such circumstances, incident light passes through a film and is absorbed by the substrate, and the film is then heated by the heat influx across the interface with the substrate. The optical absorption in the substrate is affected by optical reflection. The energy reflectance varies periodically with the film thickness due to optical interference between light waves reflected from the gas-liquid and liquid-solid interfaces. The periodic variation of the reflectance strongly affects the film stability, which also varies periodically with the film thickness. Characteristic scales of the instability are also affected by the substrate thickness and incident light intensity. While qualitative aspects of the stability can be easily obtained from the analysis based on a simplified model that is derived under the thin-substrate assumption, the quantitative evaluation for the case of substrates of moderate to large thickness should be based on a more generalized model that allows for substrates of arbitrary thickness.},

By employing the unique characteristics of microscale flow phenomena, various techniques have been established for fast and accurate separation and sorting of microparticles in a continuous manner. The advancements in microfluidics enable sorting technologies that combine the benefits of continuous operation with small-sized scale suitable for manipulation and probing of individual particles or cells. Microfluidic sorting platforms require smaller sample volume, which has several benefits in terms of reduced cost of reagents, analysis time and less invasiveness to patients for sample extraction. Additionally, smaller size of device together with lower fabrication cost allows massive parallelization, which makes high-throughput sorting possible. Both passive and active separation and sorting techniques have been reported in literature. Passive techniques utilize the interaction between particles, flow field and the channel structure and do not require external fields. On the other hand, active techniques make use of external fields in various forms but offer better performance. This paper provides an extensive review of various passive and active separation techniques including basic theories and experimental details. The working principles are explained in detail, and performances of the devices are discussed.},

  abstract = {Several studies have been performed on the integration of biosensors into digital microfluidics (DMF). Despite the general success in their detection capabilities, there are still two challenges associated with the integration of biosensors into DMF: (1) complete removal of the droplet containing the analytes from the sensing surface; and (2) biochemical regeneration of the biosensor involving detaching the target analyte from the receptor after each round of sensing. The latter is case dependent and the solution can vary from one application to another. Our research aims at addressing the former, the solution to which is applicable to all biosensors integrated to DMF. This paper presents a thorough characterization of the hydrophilic surface of the biosensor in terms of wettability and geometry, taking into account the overall configuration of the DMF platform. Consequently, we identify the optimal geometry of the sensing surface and the DMF platform providing successful removal of the target droplet from the sensing surface after detection. Based on the results, the gap height is suggested to be chosen at the upper limit of the applicable range. Also, the biosensor, patterned on the device top plate, is recommended to be designed with a high aspect ratio and aligned with the center of the actuating electrode. As a proof of concept, the optimum configuration is implemented on a DMF platform with an interdigitated capacitive biosensor to detect different concentrations of Cryptosporidium, for which it is shown that the sample droplet is removed successfully from the superhydrophilic surface of the biosensor.},

A great deal of effort has been devoted to improve and advance these devices with the goal of performing complete sets of biochemical assays on the device and possibly developing portable platforms for point of care applications. Among the different microfluidic systems used for such a purpose, digital microfluidics (DMF) shows high flexibility and capability of performing multiplex and parallel biochemical operations, and hence, has been considered as a suitable candidate for lab-on-a-chip applications. In this review, we discuss the most recent advances in the DMF platforms, and evaluate the feasibility of developing multifunctional packages for performing complete sets of processes of biochemical assays, particularly for point-of-care applications. The progress in the development of DMF systems is reviewed from eight different aspects, including device fabrication, basic fluidic operations, automation, manipulation of biological samples, advanced operations, detection, biological applications, and finally, packaging and portability of the DMF devices. Success in developing the lab-on-a-chip DMF devices will be concluded based on the advances achieved in each of these aspects.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the thorough analysis of a new operator developed for unequal droplet splitting by geometrical modification of a conventional electrode in digital microfluidic (DMF) platforms. This operator functions in an area as small as the size of a conventional electrode divided into several smaller sub-electrodes addressable independently. Using this operator, droplets can be precisely split unequally with a high volume ratio, as well as being dispensed with a wide range of sizes from a reservoir. This operator functions without complications in the fabrication process and the need for additional external modules such as feedback control systems. To characterize the range of the applicability of this operator, the effects of the applied voltage, the gap height between the two plates, and the sub-electrode geometry on the splitting performance are studied. For high applied voltages, splitting is performed with an error close to 5\% (similar to the splitting precision obtained in conventional DMF devices); whereas, for voltages close to the threshold value, the error is less than 1\%. In this way the droplet size becomes fairly independent of the geometry and the gap height. The threshold splitting voltage versus gap height has also been studied and shows a linear behavior, facilitating the selection of proper voltages for high precision splitting. For the three subelectrode patterns studied here (i.e. square, horizontal stripe, and vertical stripe), the results show that the square sub-electrodes provide higher reliability and a wider range of sizes for the split droplet as compared to the other patterns. The final part of the study illustrates that there is a linear relation between the area of the split droplets and the number of actuated sub-electrodes. This linear behavior allows for the selection of an appropriate number of the sub-electrodes to be actuated based on the desired volume of the droplet.},

Soft materials such as gelatin and gelatin-based hydrogels have grown in popularity for use in a wide variety of applications including tissue engineering, biofabrication, and organ transplantation. With hydrogel structures being used in such demanding applications, it is crucial to properly characterize the dynamic behavior of these soft structures. Although there have been major improvements in measurement technology for determining the mechanical properties of soft, translucent materials, it remains quite challenging to reliably measure the Young's and shear moduli of these materials in a way that remains straightforward, low-cost, and non-contact. This research aims to address the weaknesses in modern measurement methods and develop a system suitable for characterizing the elastic moduli of soft materials that requires only four, inexpensive, off-the-shelf components. Utilizing a Raspberry Pi, stepping motor, and an inexpensive camera, the Young's and shear moduli of a gelatin column is measured five times. The standard deviation between measurement was observed to be less than 0.15\% with high accuracy having an error of less than 4.6\% when compared to relatively expensive, conventional measurement techniques.},

The on-chip IMERs consist of porous polymer (thiol-ene) monolith plugs prepared in situ by photopolymerization and functionalized with recombinant CYP1A1 isoforms (an important detoxification route for many drugs and other xenobiotics). The DMF devices also incorporate inexpensive, inkjet-printed microheaters for on-demand regio-specific heating of the IMERs to physiological temperature, which is crucial for maintaining the activity of the temperature-sensitive CYP reaction. For on-chip monitoring of the CYP activity, the DMF devices were combined with a commercial well-plate reader, and a custom fluorescence quantification method was developed for detection of the chosen CYP1A1 model activity (ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylation). The reproducibility of the developed assay was examined with the help of ten parallel CYP-IMERs. All CYP-IMERs provided statistically significant difference (in fluorescence response) compared to any of the negative controls (including room-temperature reactions). The average (n = 10) turnover rate was 20.3 {\textpm} 9.0 fmol resorufin per minute. Via parallelization, the concept of the droplet-based CYP-IMER developed in this study provides a viable approach to rapid and low-cost prediction of the metabolic clearance of new chemical entities in vitro.},

  abstract = {Microfluidic technologies have a unique ability to control more precisely and effectively on two-phase flow systems in comparison with macro systems. Controlling the size of the droplets and bubbles has led to an ever-increasing expansion of this technology in two-phase systems. Liquid-liquid and gas-liquid two-phase flows because of their numerous applications in different branches such as reactions, synthesis, emulsions, cosmetic, food, drug delivery, etc. have been the most critical two-phase flows in microfluidic systems. This review highlights recent progress in two-phase flows in microfluidic devices. The fundamentals of two-phase flows, including some essential dimensionless numbers, governing equations, and some most well-known numerical methods are firstly introduced, followed by a review of standard methods for producing segmented flows such as emulsions in microfluidic systems. Then various encapsulated structures, a common twophase flow structure in microfluidic devices, and different methods of their production are reviewed. Finally, applications of two-phase microfluidic flows in drug-delivery, biotechnology, mixing, and microreactors are briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {Outbreaks of foodborne diseases have become a global health concern; hence, many improvements and developments have been made to reduce the risk of food contamination. We developed a centrifugal microfluidic automatic wireless endpoint detection system integrated with loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for monoplex pathogen detection. Six identical sets were designed on the microfluidic compact disc (CD) to perform 30 genetic analyses of three different species of foodborne pathogens. The consecutive loading, mixing, and aliquoting of the LAMP primers/reagents and DNA sample solutions were accomplished using an optimized square-wave microchannel, metering chambers and revulsion per minute (RPM) control. We tested 24 strains of pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp and Vibrio cholerae), with 8 strains of each bacterium, and performed DNA amplification on the microfluidic CD for 60 min. Then, the amplicons of the LAMP reaction were detected using the calcein colorimetric method and further analysed via the developed electronic system interfaced with Bluetooth wireless technology to transmit the results to a smartphone. The system showed a limit of detection (LOD) of 3 {\texttimes} 10-5 ng {$\mu$}L-1 DNA by analysing the colour change when tested with chicken meat spiked with the three pathogenic bacteria. Since the entire process was performed in a fully automated way and was easy to use, our microdevice is suitable for point-of-care (POC) testing with high simplicity, providing affordability and accessibility even to poor, resource-limited settings.},

Nevertheless, efforts are still required to integrally seize all the advantages of smartphones, as well as to share the developments in easily adoptable formats. For this purpose, here we present the free platform               appuente               ~that was designed for the easy integration of microfluidic chips, smartphones, and the cloud. It includes a mobile app for end users, which provides chip identification and tracking, guidance and control, processing, smart-imaging, result reporting and cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) integration. The platform also includes a web app for PONT developers, to easily customize their mobile apps and manage the data of administered tests. Three application examples were used to validate               appuente               : a dummy grayscale detector that mimics quantitative colorimetric tests, a root elongation assay for pesticide toxicity assessment, and a lateral flow immunoassay for leptospirosis detection. The platform openly offers fast prototyping of smartphone apps to the wide community of lab-on-a-chip developers, and also serves as a friendly framework for new techniques, IoT integration and further capabilities. Exploiting these advantages will certainly help to enlarge the use of PONT with real-time connectivity in the near future.},

This paper reports the development of DMF devices using low-cost materials and simple deposition techniques specifically for the device dielectric component. Three commercial polyurethane coatings were investigated for their feasibility as the dielectric layer. The electrowetting behaviour of these materials was investigated by evaluating the change in contact angle with applied voltage of a water droplet sitting on the dielectric samples prepared using easy deposition methods such as spraying and spin coating. Devices were then fabricated using these materials to evaluate their capability to actuate droplets. Five types of polyurethane dielectric sample exhibited contact angle reversibility with hysteresis ranging between 4{$^\circ$} to 25{$^\circ$} after 250 VDC application. Droplet transportation back and forth across 8 electrodes at 180 VRMS has been demonstrated in a device made of one of the polyurethane coatings using a spraying technique. This result implies the potential of using polyurethane for future development of low-cost and disposable DMF devices.},

However, fluid behavior undergoes significant changes as geometric scale decreases. The laminar flow behavior of fluids in microfluidic devices must be accommodated in the design and development of clinical and bio-clinical miniaturized systems. Conclusion: The scale of chemical and clinical analysis systems will continue to decrease. The capability to manufacture smaller fluidic devices and to quantitatively monitor smaller volumes of liquids bring this process of miniaturization into the domain of laminar flow. New and enabling technologies are being developed using the unique diffusion-based characteristics of the laminar flow domain for sample preparation and analysis. These new analytical systems will have a significant impact on the future of clinical diagnostics. D 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The YoungLippmann equation provides the simplest thermodynamic framework and describes electrowetting adequately. Saturation, i.e. the reduced or nullified effectiveness of the external voltage below a threshold contact angle value, was and remains the most controversial issue in the physics of electrowetting. A simple estimation of the limits of validity of the Young model is obtained by setting the solid-liquid interfacial tension to zero. This approach predicts acceptably the change in electrowetting mechanism but not the minimal value of the contact angle achievable during electrowetting. The mechanism of saturation is, in all probability, related to charge injection into the dielectric layer insulating the working electrode but physical details are scarce. Surface force and spectroscopic techniques should be deployed in order to improve our understanding of the surface charging of insulators immersed in conductive liquids. Electrowetting in solid-liquid-liquid systems is generally more effective and robust. Electrowetting offers new ways of studying the dynamics of liquid movement as it allows selective changes in the wettability of the system.},

Polymeric microfluidics, unlike glass and silicon, offer several advantages such as low-cost mass manufacturing and a wide range of beneficial material properties, which make them the material of choice for commercial applications and high-throughput systems. Among polymers used for the fabrication of microfluidic devices, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) still remains the most widely used material in academia due to its advantageous properties, such as excellent transparency and biocompatibility. However, commercialization of PDMS has been a challenge mostly due to the high cost of the current fabrication strategies. Moreover, specific surface modification and functionalization steps are required to tailor the surface chemistry of PDMS channels (               e.g.               biomolecule immobilization, surface hydrophobicity and antifouling properties) with respect to the desired application. While significant research has been reported in the field of PDMS microfluidics, functionalization of PDMS surfaces remains a critical step in the fabrication process that is difficult to navigate. This review first offers a thorough illustration of existing fabrication methods for PDMS-based microfluidic devices, providing several recent advancements in this field with the aim of reducing the cost and time for mass production of these devices. Next, various conventional and emerging approaches for engineering the surface chemistry of PDMS are discussed in detail. We provide a wide range of functionalization techniques rendering PDMS microchannels highly biocompatible for physical or covalent immobilization of various biological entities while preventing non-specific interactions.},

Investigating cell response to various stimulations is much more accurate and comprehensive with the aid of microfluidic devices. In this study, we introduced a microfluidic device by which the matrix density as a mechanical property and the concentration profile of a biochemical factor as a chemical property could be altered. Our microfluidic device has a cell tank and a cell culture chamber to mimic both 2D to 3D and 3D to 3D migration of three types of cells. Fluid shear stress is negligible on the cells and a stable concentration gradient can be obtained by diffusion. The device was designed by a numerical simulation so that the uniformity of the concentration gradients throughout the cell culture chamber was obtained. Adult neural cells were cultured within this device and they showed different branching and axonal navigation phenotypes within varying nerve growth factor (NGF) concentration profiles. Neural stem cells were also cultured within varying collagen matrix densities while exposed to NGF concentrations and they experienced 3D to 3D collective migration. By generating vascular endothelial growth factor concentration gradients, adult human dermal microvascular endothelial cells also migrated in a 2D to 3D manner and formed a stable lumen within a specific collagen matrix density. It was observed that a minimum absolute concentration and concentration gradient were required to stimulate migration of all types of the cells.

  abstract = {Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) chips have emerged as popular actuators for droplet-based digital microfluidic biochips. The chip-level design of EWOD chips allows for the integration electrode addressing and wire routing, thus helping cope with the increasing complexity of biochemical assays. Furthermore, high-frequency EWODs also facilitate finishing time-sensitive bioassays such as incubation and emerging flash chemistry in specific time periods. However, the reliability of the EWOD chip is reduced by the contact angle change reduction problem as a result of the repeated and frequent switching of electrodes. Thus, the chip-level design of EWOD chips should consider reliability, electrode addressing, and the wire routing problem. This paper presents a graph-based chip-level design algorithm. By setting the switching-time constraint, the number of switching times can be limited to minimize the impact of the contact angle change reductions problem. Also, a progressive addressing and routing approach is proposed to overcome the complex wire routing problem. Experimental results show the proposed algorithm effectively minimizes the impact of the contact angle change reduction problem, thus providing a reliable chip-level design with a feasible wire routing solution with the required number of pins.},

It can enter the food supply chain at various stages of production, processing, distribution, and marketing. High prevalence of Salmonella necessitates efficient and effective approaches for its identification, detection, and monitoring at an early stage. Because conventional methods based on plate counting and real-time polymerase chain reaction are timeconsuming and laborious, novel rapid detection methods are urgently needed for in-field and on-line applications. Biosensors provide many advantages over conventional laboratory assays in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, and show superiority in rapid response and potential portability. They are now recognized as promising alternative tools and one of the most on-site applicable and end user--accessible methods for rapid detection. In recent years, we have witnessed a flourishing of studies in the development of robust and elaborate biosensors for detection of Salmonella in food. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview on Salmonella biosensors by highlighting different signal-transducing mechanisms (optical, electrochemical, piezoelectric, etc.) and critically analyzing its recent trends, particularly in combination with nanomaterials, microfluidics, portable instruments, and smartphones.

According to pharmacopeia requirements, sub-visible particle levels need to be controlled throughout the shelf life of the product. Therefore, in addition to determining the particle counts, it is crucial to accurately characterize the particles in a drug product to understand the stress condition of exposure and make appropriate mitigation actions for specific formulations. In this study, we developed a new method for intelligently characterizing the protein particles by micro-Raman spectroscopy on a digital microfluidic chip (DMF). Microliters of stress degradation-induced protein particle solutions were loaded onto the DMF chip, and multiple droplets were generated and used for Raman spectroscopy testing. Multiple machine learning classification models were trained by Raman spectra of the obtained protein particles, and the eight protein particles were successfully characterized and predicted with high classification accuracy (93\% - 100\%). The advantages of the proposed novel particle characterization method include a closed system to prevent particle contamination, one-stop testing of morphological and chemical structure information, low sample volume consumption, reusable particle droplets, and simplified data analysis and high classification accuracy. It provides great potential to determine the probable root cause of particle sources or stress conditions based on a single assay to develop an accurate particle control strategies that ultimately extend the product shelf-life.},

However, current commercial ddPCR devices for detecting the gene chip are time consuming due to complex image stitching. To address this issue, we propose a universal concentration determination system and realize one-time gene chip imaging with high resolution. All the functional units are controlled by self-developed software using the PyQt5 module in Python. Without stitching technology, images of the ddPCR chip (28 mm {\texttimes} 18 mm) containing 20\,000 independent 0.81 nL micro chambers can be obtained in less than 15 seconds, which saves about 165 seconds. A white laser light source (2 mW cm               -2               ) was employed as a substitute for the mercury lamp. Its wavelength matches well with typical fluorescent dyes (               e.g.               , HEX, ROX and Cy5), and thus it can strengthen the fluorescence intensity for weak signals. The results also demonstrated that the correlation coefficient for the measured concentration and theoretical value was above 99\%, by testing the ddPCR products with COVID-19 virus. Such a system can greatly reduce the time required for image acquisition and DNA concentration determination, and thus is able to speed up the lab-to-application process for ddPCR technology.},

Many nanoparticle (NP) therapies have been approved for clinical use, including as imaging agents or as platforms for drug delivery and gene therapy. However, there are remaining challenges that hinder translation, such as non-scalable production methods and the inefficiency of current NP formulations in delivering their cargo to their target. To address challenges with existing formulation methods that have batch-to-batch variability and produce particles with high dispersity, microfluidics---devices that manipulate fluids on a micrometer scale---have demonstrated enormous potential to generate reproducible NP formulations for therapeutic, diagnostic, and preventative ap\- plications. Microfluidic-generated NP formulations have been shown to have enhanced properties for biomedical applications by formulating NPs with more controlled physical properties than is possible with bulk techni\- ques---such as size, size distribution, and loading efficiency. In this review, we highlight advances in microfluidic technologies for the formulation of NPs, with an emphasis on lipid-based NPs, polymeric NPs, and inorganic NPs. We provide a summary of microfluidic devices used for NP formulation with their advantages and respective challenges. Additionally, we provide our analysis for future outlooks in the field of NP formulation and micro\- fluidics, with emerging topics of production scale-independent formulations through device parallelization and multi-step reactions within droplets.},

In the proliferation assay, cells were grown for four days and their proliferation rates were determined by regular impedance measurements. In the serum sensing assay, a dilution series of cell media containing different concentrations of serum was evaluated using impedance measurements to determine the optimum conditions for proliferation. The DMF impedance system is label-free, does not require imaging, and is compatible with long-term cell culture.

  abstract = {We have developed a new hybrid droplet-to-digital microfluidic platform (D2D) that integrates droplet-in-channel microfluidics with digital microfluidics for performing multi-step single cell assays.           ,                             We have developed a new hybrid droplet-to-digital microfluidic platform (D2D) that integrates droplet-in-channel microfluidics with digital microfluidics (DMF) for performing multi-step assays. This D2D platform combines the strengths of the two formats---droplets-in-channel for facile generation of droplets containing single cells, and DMF for on-demand manipulation of droplets including control of different droplet volumes (pL--{$\mu$}L), creation of a dilution series of ionic liquid (IL), and parallel single cell culturing and analysis for IL toxicity screening. This D2D device also allows for automated analysis that includes a feedback-controlled system for merging and splitting of droplets to add reagents, an integrated Peltier element for parallel cell culture at optimum temperature, and an impedance sensing mechanism to control the flow rate for droplet generation and preventing droplet evaporation. Droplet-in-channel is well-suited for encapsulation of single cells as it allows the careful manipulation of flow rates of aqueous phase containing cells and oil to optimize encapsulation. Once single cell containing droplets are generated, they are transferred to a DMF chip               via               a capillary where they are merged with droplets containing IL and cultured at 30 {$^\circ$}C. The DMF chip, in addition to permitting cell culture and reagent (ionic liquid/salt) addition, also allows recovery of individual droplets for off-chip analysis such as further culturing and measurement of ethanol production. The D2D chip was used to evaluate the effect of IL/salt type (four types: NaOAc, NaCl, [C               2               mim] [OAc], [C               2               mim] [Cl]) and concentration (four concentrations: 0, 37.5, 75, 150 mM) on the growth kinetics and ethanol production of yeast and as expected, increasing IL concentration led to lower biomass and ethanol production. Specifically, [C               2               mim] [OAc] had inhibitory effects on yeast growth at concentrations 75 and 150 mM and significantly reduced their ethanol production compared to cells grown in other ILs/salts. The growth curve trends obtained by D2D matched conventional yeast culturing in microtiter wells, validating the D2D platform. We believe that our approach represents a generic platform for multi-step biochemical assays such as drug screening, digital PCR, enzyme assays, immunoassays and cell-based assays.},

The tagged S. aureus cells were magnetically captured in a detection cassette, and then fluorescence was imaged using a smartphone camera with a light-emitting diode as the excitation source. Our results showed quantitative detection capability with a minimum detectable concentration as low as 10 cfu/ml by counting individual bacteria cells, efficiently capturing S. aureus cells directly from a peanut milk sample within 10 min. When the selectivity of detection was investigated using samples spiked with other pathogenic bacteria, no significant non-specific detection occurred. Furthermore, strains of S. aureus from various origins showed comparable results, ensuring that the approach can be widely adopted. Therefore, the quantitative fluorescence imaging platform on a smartphone could allow on-site detection of bacteria, providing great potential assistance during major infectious disease outbreaks in remote and resource-limited settings.},

The use of Digital Microfluidics Biochips (DMFBs) in disease assessment and recognition of target molecules had become popular during the past few years. The reliability of these DMFBs is crucial when they are used in various medical applications. Errors found in these biochips are mainly due to the defects developed during droplet manipulation, chip degradation and inaccuracies in the bio-assay experiments. The recently proposed Micro-electrode-dot Array (MEDA)-based DMFBs involve both fluidic and electronic domains in the micro-electrode cell. Thus, the testing techniques for these biochips should be revised in order to ensure proper functionality. This paper describes recent advances in the testing technologies for digital microfluidics biochips, which would serve as a useful platform for developing revised/new testing techniques for MEDA-based biochips. Therefore, the relevancy of these techniques with respect to testing of MEDA-based biochips is analyzed in order to exploit the full potential of these biochips.},

Various simulations were performed for droplet-electrode short fault model involving single and multiple micro-electrodes. Furthermore, the loss of droplet volume due to the presence of defect was analyzed using COMSOL Multiphysics. The simulation results based on PSpice and COMSOL show that the proposed approach is effective for detecting defects in MEDA-based biochips.},

  abstract = {The miniaturization of laboratory procedures for Lab-on-Chip (LoC) devices and translation to various platforms such as single cell analysis or Organ-on-Chip (OoC) systems are revolutionizing the life sciences and biomedical fields. As a result, microfluidics is becoming a viable technology for improving the quality and sensitivity of critical processes. Yet, standard test methods have not yet been established to validate basic manufacturing steps, performance, and safety of microfluidic devices. The successful development and widespread use of microfluidic technologies are greatly dependent on the community's success in establishing widely supported test protocols. A key area that requires consensus guidelines is leakage testing. There are unique challenges in preventing and detecting leaks in microfluidic systems because of their small dimensions, high surface-area to volume ratios, low flow rates, limited volumes, and relatively high-pressure differentials over short distances. Also, microfluidic devices often employ heterogenous components, including unique connectors and fluid-contacting materials, which potentially make them more susceptible to mechanical integrity failures. The differences between microfluidic systems and traditional macroscale technologies can exacerbate the impact of a leak on the performance and safety on the microscale. To support the microfluidics community efforts in product development and commercialization, it is critical to identify common aspects of leakage in microfluidic devices and standardize the corresponding safety and performance metrics. There is a need for quantitative metrics to provide quality assurance during or after the manufacturing process. It is also necessary to implement application-specific test methods to effectively characterize leakage in microfluidic systems. In this review, different methods for assessing microfluidics leaks, the benefits of using different test media and materials, and the utility of leakage testing throughout the product life cycle are discussed. Current leakage testing protocols and standard test methods that can be leveraged for characterizing leaks in microfluidic devices and potential classification strategies are also discussed. We hope that this review article will stimulate more discussions around the development of gas and liquid leakage test standards in academia and industry to facilitate device commercialization in the emerging field of microfluidics.},

METHODS: We performed bench-based, fluorometric enzymatic analysis on 60 deidentified newborn dried blood spots (DBSs), plus 10 Pompe-affected and 11 Fabryaffected samples, at Duke Biochemical Genetics Laboratory using a 3-mm punch for each assay and an incubation time of 20 h. We used a digital microfluidic platform to automate fluorometric enzymatic assays at Advanced Liquid Logic Inc. using extract from a single punch for both assays, with an incubation time of 6 h. Assays were also performed with an incubation time of 1 h. RESULTS: Assay results were generally comparable, although mean enzymatic activity for GAA using microfluidics was approximately 3 times higher than that obtained using bench-based methods, which could be attributed to higher substrate concentration. Clear separation was observed between the normal and affected samples at both 6- and 1-h incubation times using digital microfluidics. CONCLUSIONS: A digital microfluidic platform compared favorably with a clinical reference laboratory to perform enzymatic analysis in DBSs for Pompe and Fabry disorders. This platform presents a new technology for a newborn screening laboratory to screen LSDs},

  abstract = {Children are not tiny adults'' is an adage commonly used in pediatrics to emphasize the fact that children often have different physiological responses to sickness and trauma compared to adults. However, despite widespread acceptance of this concept, diagnostic blood testing is an excellent example of clinical care that is not yet customized to the needs of children, especially newborns. Cumulative blood loss resulting from clinical testing does not typically impact critically ill adult patients, but can quickly escalate in children, leading to iatrogenic anemia and related comorbidities. Moreover, the tests prioritized for rapid, near-patient testing in adults are not always the most clinically relevant tests for children or newborns. This report describes the development of a digital microfluidic testing platform and associated clinical assays purposely curated to address current shortcomings in pediatric laboratory testing by using microliter volumes ({$<$}50 {\textmu}L) of samples. The automated platform consists of a small instrument and single-use cartridges, which contain all reagents necessary to prepare the sample and perform the assay. Electrowetting technology is used to precisely manipulate nanoliter-sized droplets of samples and reagents inside the cartridge. To date, we have automated three disparate types of assays (biochemical assays, immunoassays, and molecular assays) on the platform and have developed over two dozen unique tests, each with important clinical application to newborns and pediatric patients. Cell lysis, plasma preparation, magnetic bead washing, thermocycling, incubation, and many other essential functions were all performed on the cartridge without any user intervention. The resulting assays demonstrate performance comparable to standard clinical laboratory assays and are economical due to the reduced hands-on effort required for each assay and lower overall reagent consumption. These capabilities allow a wide range of assays to be run simultaneously on the same cartridge using significantly reduced sample volumes with results in minutes.},

We present performance validation data on a digital microfluidic platform that performs multiplex enzymatic assays for Pompe, Fabry, Hunter, Gaucher, and Hurler diseases. Methods: We developed an investigational disposable digital microfluidic cartridge that uses a single dried blood spot (DBS) punch for performing a 5-plex fluorometric enzymatic assay on up to 44 DBS samples. Precision and linearity of the assays were determined by analyzing quality control DBS samples; clinical performance was determined by analyzing 600 presumed normal and known affected samples (12 for Pompe, 7 for Fabry and 10 each for Hunter, Gaucher and Hurler). Results: Overall coefficient of variation (CV) values between cartridges, days, instruments, and operators ranged from 2 to 21\%; linearity correlation coefficients were {$\geq$} 0.98 for all assays. The multiplex enzymatic assay performed from a single DBS punch was able to discriminate presumed normal from known affected samples for 5 LSDs. Conclusions: Digital microfluidic technology shows potential for rapid, high-throughput screening for 5 LSDs in a newborn screening laboratory environment.

One emerging possibility is microfluidics or devices that employ small amounts of fluids (10-6 to 10-9 l) flowing in channels where at least one dimension is less than 1 mm. However, under these conditions, the predominant effects are not necessarily those present in conventional macroscopic unit operations. Dominant physical effects at the microfluidic scale are introduced through the use of dimensionless numbers. Different types of geometries to generate multi-phase flows in micro-channels, techniques and materials to construct the micro-devices, principally soft lithography and laser ablation, as well as methods used to modify surface properties of channels, are reviewed. The operation of micro-devices, the role of flow regimes, rheological behaviour of fluids in micro-channels and of transient time is discussed. Finally, systems developed to generate emulsions and foams, fluid mixing and dispersion, and future applications of these devices in food processing and food analysis are presented.},

Several papers have aimed to describe the physical phenomena underlying this spectacular phenomenon, in which two opposite effects, solutal and thermal Marangoni stresses, play competitive roles. We performed investigations of the Marangoni bursting phenomenon, paying attention to the surface temperature changes during bursting and after it. Fragmentation instabilities were monitored using a thermal camera for various initial alcohol/water compositions and at different stages of the process. We uncovered the role of thermocapillary Marangoni flows within the more viscous oil phase that are responsible for outward and inward shrinking of the periphery circle at the final stage of the phenomenon, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the thermal Marangoni effect. Simulations of the Marangoni thermocapillary effect in an oil bath by solving coupled Navier--Stokes and heat transport equations using the COMSOL Multiphysics software platform support our experimental observations.},

  abstract = {The current practice of designing microfluidic Lab-on-a-Chip (LoCs) limits reusing designs and makes sharing tasks among researchers difficult. One way to achieve that objective is to borrow best practices from engineering. Also it takes a lot of skills to design LoCs. Design-by-assembly in which a LoC can be designed by configuring, laying out subsystems can help new researchers to develop custom chips. Flexible, reusable, and rapid-prototyping-feasible LoC designs can be achieved by fabricated modular microfluidic blocks. However, challenging problems still persist, which limit the usefulness of prefabricated blocks. We propose software microfluidic modules (SoftMABs) based design technique to solve issues fabricated modules face. By configuring SoftMABs, integrating them, the new assembly of SoftMABs can form a 3D LoC design ready to be prototyped. The proposed method can make designing a complex LoC less challenging, and collaborating among laboratories easier. We created SoftMABs and designed a custom microfluidic chip by assembling SoftMABs like LEGOs, dragging-and-dropping them. Later we reconfigured them - by replacing a SoftMAB with another module - to make a new LoC. We believe this computeraided method is an interesting and useful LoC design technique.},

Next, synthesized nanocomposite thin film of BST/Teflon{\textregistered} AF is coated on the coplanar electrodes to act as both dielectric and hydrophobic layer. Experiments show that change in electrode dimension (or shape), such as electrode length (L), gap (G) and no. of teeth (T) result different contact line (CL) between the droplet and the actuated electrode. This leads to change in VT for droplet transport. It is found that higher contact line results in lower threshold voltage, while lower contact line results in higher threshold voltage.

We report a novel paper-based single input channel microfluidic device that can detect more than one whole-cell foodborne bacteria at the same time, and comes with quantitative reading via image analysis. This microfluidic paper-based multiplexed aptasensor simultaneously detects E. coli O157:H7 and S. Typhimurium. Custom designed particles provide colorimetric signal enhancement and false results prevention. Several aptamers were screened and the highest-affinity aptamers were optimized and employed for detection of these bacteria in solution, both in a buffer as well as pear juice. Image analysis was used to read and quantify the colorimetric signal and measure bacteria concentration, thus rendering this paper based microfluidic device quantitative. The colorimetric results show linearity over a wide concentration range (102 CFU/mL to 108 CFU/mL) and a limit of detection (LOD) of 103 CFU/mL and 102 CFU/mL for E. coli O157:H7 and S. Typhimurium, respectively. An insignificant change in colorimetric response for non-target bacteria indicates the aptasesnors are specific. The reported multiplexed colorimetric paper-based microfluidic devices is likely to perform well for on-site rapid screening of pathogenic bacteria in water and food products.},

  abstract = {Nanozymes are synthetic nanoparticulate materials that mimic the biological activities of enzymes by virtue of their surface chemistry. Enzymes catalyze biological reactions with a very high degree of specificity. Examples include the horseradish peroxidase, lactate, glucose, and cholesterol oxidases. For this reason, many industrial uses of enzymes outside their natural environments have been developed. Similar to enzymes, many industrial applications of nanozymes have been developed and used. Unlike the enzymes, however, nanozymes are cost-effectively prepared, purified, stored, and reproducibly and repeatedly used for long periods of time. The detection and identification of pathogens is among some of the reported applications of nanozymes. Three of the methodologic milestones in the evolution of pathogen detection and identification include the incubation and growth, immunoassays and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) strategies. Although advances in the history of pathogen detection and identification have given rise to novel methods and devices, these are still short of the response speed, accuracy and cost required for point-of-care use. Debuting recently, nanozymology offers significant improvements in the six methodological indicators that are proposed as being key in this review, including simplicity, sensitivity, speed of response, cost, reliability, and durability of the immunoassays and PCR strategies. This review will focus on the applications of nanozymes in the detection and identification of pathogens in samples obtained from foods, natural, and clinical sources. It will highlight the impact of nanozymes in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent and PCR strategies by discussing the mechanistic improvements and the role of the design and architecture of the nanozyme nanoconjugates. Because of their contribution to world health burden, the three most important pathogens that will be considered include viruses, bacteria and fungi. Although not quite seen as pathogens, the review will also consider the detection of cancer cells and helminth parasites. The review leaves very little doubt that nanozymology has introduced remarkable advances in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and PCR strategies for detecting these five classes of pathogens. However, a gap still exists in the application of nanozymes to detect and identify fungal pathogens directly, although indirect strategies in which nanozymes are used have been reported. From a mechanistic point of view, the nanozyme technology transfer to laboratory research methods in PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay studies, and the point-of-care devices such as electronic biosensors and lateral flow detection strips, that is currently taking place, is most likely to give rise to no small revolution in each of the six methodological indicators for pathogen detection and identification. While the evidence of widespread research reports, clinical trials and point-of-care device patents support this view, the gaps that still exist point to a need for more basic research studies to be conducted on the applications of nanozymology in pathogen detection and identification. The multidisciplinary nature of the research on the application of nanozymes in the detection and identification of pathogens requires chemists and physicists for the design, fabrication, and characterization of nanozymes; microbiologists for the design, testing and analysis of the methodologies, and clinicians or clinical researchers for the evaluation of the methodologies and devices in the clinic. Many reports have also implicated required skills in mathematical modelling, and electronic engineering. While the review will conclude with a synopsis of the impact of nanozymology on the detection and identification of viruses, bacteria, fungi, cancer cells, and helminths, it will also point out opportunities that exist in basic research as well as opportunities for innovation aimed at novel laboratory methodologies and devices. In this regard there is no doubt that there are numerous unexplored research areas in the application of nanozymes for the detection of pathogens. For example, most research on the applications of nanozymes for the detection and identification of fungi is so far limited only to the detection of mycotoxins and other chemical compounds associated with fungal infection. Therefore, there is scope for exploration of the application of nanozymes in the direct detection of fungi in foods, especially in the agricultural production thereof. Many fungal species found in seeds severely compromise their use by inactivating the germination thereof. Fungi also produce mycotoxins that can severely compromise the health of humans if consumed.},

The fabrication technique using laser direct etching (LDE) on ITO glass has the advantages of being rapid, low cost and convenient. However, the fabrication resolution of LDE limits the minimum line width for patterns on ITO glasses, leading to a related wider lead wire for the actuating electrodes of DMF compared with photolithography. Therefore, the lead wire of electrodes could affect the droplet motion on the digital microfluidic chip due to the increased contact line with the droplet. Herein, we developed a finite element model of a DMF with improved efficiency to investigate the effect of the lead wire. An optimized electrode pattern was then designed based on a theoretical analysis and validated by a simulation, which significantly decreased the deformation of the droplets down to 0.012 mm. The performance of the optimized electrode was also verified in an experiment. The proposed simulation method could be further extended to other DMF systems or applications to provide an efficient approach for the design and optimization of DMF chips.},

For precise and programmable printing of the patterned electrodes, we used a digital plotter with a ballpoint pen filled with a silver nanoparticle (AgNP) ink. Instead of using conventional material deposition methods, such as chemical vapor deposition, printing, and spin coating, for fabricating the thin dielectric layer, we used a simple method in which we prepared a thin dielectric layer using pre-made linear, low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) plastic (17-{\textmu}m thick) by simple wrapping. We then sealed it tightly with thin silicone oil layers so that it could be used as a DMF chip. Such a treated dielectric layer showed good electrowetting performance for a sessile drop without contact angle hysteresis under an applied voltage of less than 170 V. By using this straightforward fabrication method, we quickly and affordably fabricated a paper-based DMF chip and demonstrated the digital electrofluidic actuation and manipulation of drops.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Rapid, sensitive, and selective detection of live pathogens remains a key priority for quality control and risk assessment. While conventional methods often require complicated workflows, costly reagents, lab equipment, and are time-consuming, rendering them inadequate for field~testing and low-resource settings. Increased attention has been drawn to developing alternative low-cost and rapid methods to detect on-site live pathogens in different environmental matrices. Among them, microfluidic devices that integrate various laboratory functions in a miniaturized manner have proven to be a promising tool for the rapid and sensitive detection of pathogens. Herein, the development of microfluidic devices specifically designed for the detection of live pathogens is discussed along a concise summary of novel microfluidics~systems recently developed, contrasted to conventional methods regarding assay time, the limit of detection, and target organisms. These include a variety of micro total analysis systems ({\textmu}TAS) and microfluidic paper-based analytical devices ({\textmu}PADs) in combination with molecular methods and traditional live cell detection techniques, such as cell culture, DNA intercalating dyes, resazurin, and immobilized bioreceptors (e.g., aptamers and capture antibodies). Furthermore, insights on the future perspectives of microfluidics for live pathogen detection with a highlight on the rapid and low-cost method development for field testing are provided.},

This tech\- nology enables the researchers to realize highly reliable and rapid detection and screening applications in various fields. The high-throughput nature of droplet microfluidics generates large amounts of valuable but complex droplet dataset. Deeper analysis of this intricate droplet data is very essential for detection, classification, char\- acterization and quantification of reactions/content inside the droplets. This can be carried out by Machine Learning (ML), which has proven itself in processing and providing deeper insights and precise predictions of relatively large amounts of complex data with shorter analysis times and exceptional accuracy. The analytical tools of ML enable to imbibe automation and control of many such diagnostic platforms, including DBMF, with minimum human intervention. In recent times, the potential of ML has been explored in microfluidic technology as well to tackle challenges in biomedical and biotechnological applications. The synergy of both the fields, DBMF and ML, helps in development of optimized and automated tools with higher accuracy for numerous applications. Specifically, this enables complete comprehension of the field to eventually realize a truly microfluidic total analysis system ({\textmu}TAS). This work comprehends a general review emphasizing the implementation of different ML models with DBMF to automate various activities such as fluid control, droplet size prediction, recognition of flow pattern and identification, classification and sorting of droplets in a microfluidic device.},

Because health care costs are increasing, there is an increasing need to remotely monitor the health condition of patients by point-of-care-testing. The demand for biosensors for detection of biological warfare agents has increased, and research is focused on ways of producing small portable devices that would allow fast, accurate, and on-site detection. In the past decade, the demand for rapid and accurate on-site detection of plant disease diagnosis has increased due to emerging pathogens with resistance to pesticides, increased human mobility, and regulations limiting the application of toxic chemicals to prevent spread of diseases. The portability of biosensors for onsite diagnosis is limited due to various issues, including sample preparation techniques, fluid-handling techniques, the limited lifetime of biological reagents, device packaging, integrating electronics for data collection/analysis, and the requirement of external accessories and power. Many microfluidic, electronic, and biological design strategies, such as handling liquids in biosensors without pumps/valves, the application of droplet-based microfluidics, paper-based microfluidic devices, and wireless networking capabilities for data transmission, are being explored.},

They allow for handling small amounts of samples and reagents on a circuit board and, thus, automatically execute medical experiments that are usually conducted manually in laboratories. However, there are various challenges in the design of DMFBs. Issues such as routing and layouting are complex and currently being investigated by various researchers and engineers. Although first automatic solutions assist them, the obtained results are usually provided in a complex and non-intuitive fashion. This makes the utilization and evaluation of existing approaches for DMFB design a tedious task. In this paper, we present a solution for this problem by proposing a visualization scheme for DMFBs that explicitly addresses these problems. To this end, a grammar is proposed which allows the description of resulting designs and their properties. The contributions of this work allow for a design methodology which is easy to use and provides a hassle-free environment for the involved researchers and engineers.},

Interaction of amplified products specific to the target organism with the beads in a rotating magnetic field allows for near instantaneous ({$<$}30 s) detection based on hybridization-induced aggregation (HIA) of the particles and simple optical analysis.

  abstract = {Review on miniaturization, integration, and automation of laboratory processes within centrifugal microfluidic platforms. For efficient implementation of applications, building blocks are categorized into unit operations and process chains.           ,              Centrifugal microfluidics has evolved into a mature technology. Several major diagnostic companies either have products on the market or are currently evaluating centrifugal microfluidics for product development. The fields of application are widespread and include clinical chemistry, immunodiagnostics and protein analysis, cell handling, molecular diagnostics, as well as food, water, and soil analysis. Nevertheless, new fluidic functions and applications that expand the possibilities of centrifugal microfluidics are being introduced at a high pace. In this review, we first present an up-to-date comprehensive overview of centrifugal microfluidic unit operations. Then, we introduce the term ``process chain'' to review how these unit operations can be combined for the automation of laboratory workflows. Such aggregation of basic functionalities enables efficient fluidic design at a higher level of integration. Furthermore, we analyze how novel, ground-breaking unit operations may foster the integration of more complex applications. Among these are the storage of pneumatic energy to realize complex switching sequences or to pump liquids radially inward, as well as the complete pre-storage and release of reagents. In this context, centrifugal microfluidics provides major advantages over other microfluidic actuation principles: the pulse-free inertial liquid propulsion provided by centrifugal microfluidics allows for closed fluidic systems that are free of any interfaces to external pumps. Processed volumes are easily scalable from nanoliters to milliliters. Volume forces can be adjusted by rotation and thus, even for very small volumes, surface forces may easily be overcome in the centrifugal gravity field which enables the efficient separation of nanoliter volumes from channels, chambers or sensor matrixes as well as the removal of any disturbing bubbles. In summary, centrifugal microfluidics takes advantage of a comprehensive set of fluidic unit operations such as liquid transport, metering, mixing and valving. The available unit operations cover the entire range of automated liquid handling requirements and enable efficient miniaturization, parallelization, and integration of assays.},

Due to the NP-complete nature of the problem, we also develop efficient heuristic procedures to solve this optimization problem. We apply the proposed concurrent testing methodology to a droplet-based microfluidic array that was fabricated and used to perform multiplexed glucose and lactate assays. Experimental results show that the proposed test approach interleaves test application with the biomedical assays and prevents resource conflicts. The proposed method is therefore directed at ensuring high reliability and availability of bio-MEMS and lab-on-a-chip systems, as they are increasingly deployed for safety-critical applications.},

  abstract = {Defect tolerance is an important design consideration for microfluidics-based biochips that are used for safety-critical applications. The authors propose a defect-tolerance methodology based on graceful degradation and dynamic reconfiguration. A tile-based biochip architecture is first introduced, which is scalable for large-scale bioassays. A clustered defect model is used to evaluate the graceful-degradation method for tile-based biochips. The proposed schemes ensure that the bioassays mapped to a droplet-based microfluidic array during design can be executed on a defective biochip through operation rescheduling and/or resource rebinding. Real-life biochemical procedures, namely polymerase chain reaction and multiplexed in vitro diagnostics on human physiological fluids, are used to evaluate the proposed defect-tolerance schemes.},

  abstract = {Microfluidic biochips offer a promising platform for massively parallel DNA analysis, automated drug discovery, and real-time biomolecular recognition. Current techniques for full-custom design of droplet-based ``digital'' biochips do not scale well for concurrent assays and for next-generation system-on-chip (SOC) designs that are expected to include microfluidic components. We propose a system design methodology that attempts to apply classical high-level synthesis techniques to the design of digital microfluidic biochips. We focus here on the problem of scheduling bioassay functions under resource constraints. We first develop an optimal scheduling strategy based on integer linear programming. However, because the scheduling problem is NP-complete, we also develop two heuristic techniques that scale well for large problem instances. A clinical diagnostic procedure, namely multiplexed in-vitro diagnostics on human physiological fluids, is first used to illustrate and evaluate the proposed method. Next, the synthesis approach is applied to a protein assay, which serves as a more complex bioassay application. The proposed synthesis approach is expected to reduce human effort and design cycle time, and it will facilitate the integration of microfluidic components with microelectronic components in next-generation SOCs.},

  abstract = {Microfluidics-based biochips are soon expected to revolutionize clinical diagnosis, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing, and other laboratory procedures involving molecular biology. In contrast to continuous-flow systems that rely on permanently etched microchannels, micropumps, and microvalves, digital microfluidics offers a scalable system architecture and dynamic reconfigurability; groups of unit cells in a microfluidics array can be reconfigured to change their functionality during the concurrent execution of a set of bioassays. As more bioassays are executed concurrently on a biochip, system integration and design complexity are expected to increase dramatically. This paper presents an overview of an integrated system-level design methodology that attempts to address key issues in the synthesis, testing and reconfiguration of digital microfluidics-based biochips. Different actuation mechanisms for microfluidics-based biochips, and associated design-automation trends and challenges are also discussed. The proposed top-down design-automation approach is expected to relieve biochip users from the burden of manual optimization of bioassays, time-consuming hardware design, and costly testing and maintenance procedures, and it will facilitate the integration of fluidic components with a microelectronic component in next-generation systems-on-chips (SOCs).},

The surface used in this report is, more specifically, an electrode covered with dielectrics, hence, called electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD). All the fluidic movement is confined between two plates, which we call parallel-plate channel, rather than through closed channels or on open surfaces. While transporting and merging droplets are easily verified, we discover that there exists a design criterion for a given set of materials beyond which the droplet simply cannot be cut by EWOD mechanism. The condition for successful cutting is theoretically analyzed by examining the channel gap, the droplet size and the degree of contact angle change by electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD). A series of experiments is run and verifies the criterion. A smaller channel gap, a larger droplet size and a larger change in the contact angle enhance the necking of the droplet, helping the completion of the cutting process. Creating droplets from a pool of liquid is highly related to cutting, but much more challenging. Although droplets may be created by simply pulling liquid out of a reservoir, the location of cutting is sensitive to initial conditions and turns out unpredictable. This problem of an inconsistent cutting location is overcome by introducing side electrodes, which pull the liquid perpendicularly to the main fluid path before activating the cutting. All four operations are carried out in air environment at 25 Vdc applied voltage.},

The diversity and complexity of food matrices pose great challenges for rapid and ultra-sensitive detection of S. typhimurium in food samples. A method capable of identification, detection, and quantification of S. typhimurium is essential for addressing these issues. In this study, aptamer-coated magnetic beads (Apt-MBs) are employed as capture bio-probes to specifically and selectively concentrate S. typhimurium in food samples. A self-priming chip-based digital PCR was then presented as another biosensor for on-site detection and quantification of S. typhimurium cells. The chip we developed was robust and did not require any external power for sample loading. The combination of Apt-MBs with an on-chip digital detection realized the integration into lab-on-a-chip-based biosensors for on-site monitoring of foodborne pathogens. It was possible to capture and detect S. typhimurium cells as low as 90 CFU/reaction with a capture efficiency of 94.5\%. Additionally, the whole process only took about 2 h. This unique platform could also be used to monitor other target bacteria with high specificity and sensitivity by utilizing different aptamers. Furthermore, the platform has potential applications in point-of-care testing in the future.},

These systems are commonly operated by application of electrical driving forces to an array of electrodes. While these driving forces are well characterized, the dissipative forces opposing droplet movement have not been as thoroughly examined. In recognition of this deficit, we used force- velocity plots to characterize droplet movement in digital microfluidics, which was found to be consistent with a simple theoretical framework for understanding dissipation effects for droplets in two-plate, air-filled devices. Interestingly, in some conditions, a previously unreported {${''}$}velocity saturation{${''}$} effect was observed. When examined across a range of different liquids, the forces at which this saturation occurs seem to be lower for liquids with smaller surface tensions. Furthermore, when driven at forces that cause saturation, physical phenomena are observed that are akin to what has been reported for stationary droplets in the electrowetting literature. These phenomena are detrimental to device performance, leading to a new ``force window'' approach that delineates the optimum operation conditions for different liquids. We propose that these findings may be useful for a wide range of applications for experts and new users alike in this growing field.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) integrated with processors and arrays of sensors form cyberphysical systems and consequently face a variety of unique, recently described security threats. It has been noted that techniques used for error recovery can provide some assurance of integrity when a cyberphysical DMFB is under attack. This work proposes the use of such hardware for security purposes through the randomization of checkpoints in both space and time, and provides design guidelines for designers of such systems. We define security metrics and present techniques for improving performance through static checkpoint maps, and describe performance trade-offs associated with static and random checkpoints. We also provide detailed classification of attack models and demonstrate the feasibility of our techniques with case studies on assays implemented in typical DMFB hardware.},

Despite this progress, security of DMFBs has not been adequately addressed. We present an analysis of a DMFB system prone to malicious modification of routes and propose a DMFB defense based on spatio-temporal randomized checkpoints using CCD cameras. Absent the knowledge of the time- and space-randomized checkpoints, an attacker cannot navigate the DMFB without alerting the system. We present an algorithm to guide the placement and timing of the checkpoints such that the probability that an attack can evade detection is minimized. The efficacy of the defense mechanism is illustrated with a case study under stealthy malicious modifications.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs)---an emerging technology that implements bioassays through manipulation of discrete fluid droplets---are vulnerable to actuation tampering attacks, where a malicious adversary modifies control signals for the purposes of manipulating results or causing denial-of-service. Such attacks leverage the highly programmable nature of DMFBs. However, practical DMFBs often employ a technique called pin mapping to reduce control pin count while simultaneously reducing the degrees of freedom available for droplet manipulation. Attempts to control specific electrodes as part of an attack cannot be made without inadvertently actuating other electrodes on-chip, which makes the tampering evident. This paper explores this tamperresistance property of pin mapping in detail. We derive relevant security metrics, evaluate the tamper-resistance of several existing pin mapping algorithms, and propose a new security-aware pin mapper with superior tamper-resistance as compared to prior work.},

The droplet breakup occurs at a fixed point due to the focused velocity gradient created by the nozzle shape geometry. The system not only creates monodispersed primary droplets with sizes controlled by the applied flow rates, but also generates monodispersed submicron droplets. Droplets with radii as less than 100 nm can be produced without use of surfactants.

However, microfluidic device-based biochemical sensing is still limited by conventional signal readout that relies on sophisticated instruments and trained operators.

We present the design of a multi-well plate microfluidic biochip for protein crystallization; this biochip can transfer protein samples, prepare candidate solutions, and carry out crystallization automatically. To reduce the manufacturing cost of such devices, we present an efficient algorithm to generate a pin-assignment plan for the proposed design.

Therefore, these devices must be adequately tested after manufacture and during bioassay operations. Known techniques for biochip testing are all function-oblivious, i.e., while they can detect and locate defect sites on a microfluidic array, they cannot be used to ensure correct operation of functional units. In this paper, we introduce the concept of functional testing of microfluidic biochips. We address fundamental biochip operations such as droplet dispensing, droplet transportation, mixing, splitting, and capacitive sensing. Long electrode actuation times are avoided to ensure that there is no electrode degradation during testing. We evaluate the proposed test methods using simulations as well as experiments for a fabricated biochip.},

Escherichia coli O157:H7 is one of the harmful bacterial pathogens which is distributed in soil, marine and estuarine waters, the intestinal tract of animals, or water contaminated with fecal matter. Escherichia coli O157:H7, is an enterohaemorrhagic strain of the bacterium Escherichia coli (E.coli) and a cause of foodborne illness. It can cause serious human gastrointestinal disease. A small amount of E.coli with the dose fewer than 100 organisms in food products or water is enough to cause serious illness to human. Therefore, there is a need for a more sensitive, rapid method and yet a cost effective method to examine the food and environment safety. In this case, there are many CMOS fabricated acoustic waves based technologies which are initially designed for telecommunication applications and have been developed for pathogen detection recently due to their ultra-sensitivity to the surface changes. This paper reviews the detection of E.coli (one of the dangerous food pathogens), the design, characteristic and types of CMOS fabricated acoustic wave-based methods, typically surface acoustic waves (SAW) as for their label free, selective and ultra-sensitive detection and also their advantages over the current equipment such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and quartz crystal microbalances (QCM). Besides that, the elements and principle of SAW sensors are explored in E.coli DNA detection and the advantages of DNA probe over antibody probe. It also highlights the limitations of some types of acoustic waves based sensors for the E.coli detection.},

Each fluid system has developed special technologies for functional applications owing to the different interactions among solid, liquid and gas phases.           ,              Many engineering and industrial technologies as well as biological processes are closely related to surface wettability. The control of surface wettability attracts much attention due to the prospective applications based on liquid and droplet manipulation. However, the dynamic modification of wetting is still a challenging issue both in theoretical models and practical applications. Electrowetting (EW) is one of the most widely used methods for controlling the wettability of liquids due to its fast responding speed, large switching range and excellent durability. Since Gabriel Lippmann first discovered the electrocapillary (ECP) phenomenon in 1875, which is a precursor of electrowetting, there has been considerable progress in this field, especially accompanied with the development of wettability and interface science. In this paper, we review the developments of EW for droplet manipulation in view of wetting to superwetting systems over the past decades, including theoretical basis, electrodes and fluid systems, droplet manipulation and special phenomena induced by EW. Finally, we discuss several difficult challenges in this field and provide future research directions from our perspective.},

  abstract = {Rapid prototyping methods enable the widespread adoption of microfluidic technologies by empowering end-users from non-engineering disciplines to make devices using processes that are rapid, simple and inexpensive. In this work, we developed a liquid molding technique to create silicone/PDMS microfluidic devices by replica molding. To construct a liquid mold, we use inexpensive adhesive-backed paper, an acetate backing sheet, and an off-the-shelf digital cutter to create paper molds, which we then wet with predetermined amounts of water. Due to the immiscibility of water and PDMS, mold patterns can be effectively transferred onto PDMS similarly to solid molds. We demonstrate the feasibility of these wet paper molds for the fabrication of PDMS microfluidic devices and assess the influence of various process parameters on device yield and quality. This method possesses some distinct benefits compared to conventional techniques such as photolithography and 3D printing. First, we demonstrate that the shape of a channel's crosssection may be altered from rectangular to semicircular by merely modifying the wetting parameters. Second, we illustrate how electrical impedance can be utilized as a marker for inspecting mold quality and identifying defects in a non-invasive manner without using visual tools such as microscopes or cameras. As a proof-of-concept device, we created a microfluidic T-junction droplet generator to produce water droplets in mineral oil ranging in size from 1.2 {\textmu}L to 75 {\textmu}L. We feel that this technology is an excellent addition to the microfluidic rapid prototyping toolbox and will find several applications in biological research.},

  abstract = {The migration of a small droplet has been developed during the last two decades due to its applications in industry and high technology such as MEMS and NEMS devices, Lap-On-a- chip, transportation of fluids and so on. There have many studies in this topic in which the energy source as driving force for moving of a droplet is quite difference like heating, magnetics, pressure, electric, laser and so on. In this study, the numerical computation is used to investigate the transient thermocapillary migration of a water droplet in a micro-channel under the effect of heating source. For tracking the evolution of the free interface between two immiscible fluids, we employed the finite element method with the two-phase level set technique to solve the Navier-Stokes equations and continuity equation coupled with the energy equation. Both the upper wall and the bottom wall of the microchannel are set to be an ambient temperature. 40mW heat source is placed at the distance of 1 mm from the initial position of a water droplet. When the heat source is turned on, a pair of asymmetric thermocapillary convection vortices is formed inside the droplet and the thermocapillary on the receding side is smaller than that on the advancing side. The temperature gradient inside the droplet increases quickly at the initial times and then decreases versus time. Therefore, the actuation velocity of the water droplet first increases significantly, and then decreases continuously. Furthermore, the results also indicate that the dynamic contact angle is strongly affected by the oil flow motion and the net thermocapillary momentum inside the droplet. The advancing contact angle is always larger than the receding contact angle during actuation process.},

  abstract = {This work presents a portable microfluidic paper-based analytical device (micro-PAD) card for the quantification of total ammonia nitrogen in human saliva. The amount of total ammonia nitrogen in saliva can be an indicator of the status of the oral microbiome with potential correlation to kidney health problems. The developed micro-PAD card comprises twenty units consisting of three stacked layers of circular discs: the sample layer, paper discs impregnated with sodium hydroxide solution, the PTFE membrane layer, and the detection layer, paper discs impregnated with bromothymol blue. The twenty units were aligned on transparent laminating pouches laminated to form the micro-PAD card (7.5 cm {\texttimes} 10.5 cm). Saliva samples can be directly dispensed onto the micro-PAD card and the detection was achieved by the BTB indicator color change, from yellow to blue, after conversion of ammonium into ammonia and diffusion of the ammonia gas through a hydrophobic layer. The determination of total ammonia nitrogen in saliva using the developed micro-PAD card intended to be very simple method and operated without the need of laboratory equipment. A quantification limit of 11.3 NH4+mg L-1 and linear application range from up to 150 NH4+mg L-1 were obtained making it suitable for the expected concentrations of total ammonia nitrogen in human saliva. It was successfully applied to saliva samples and its validation obtained by comparison against a potentiometric method. The card is stable for at least 1 month making it ideal as a portable device for point-of-care diagnosis.},

Since some reactants like costly reagents and infant's blood are valuable, their usage should be minimized during dilution. In this paper, we propose an optimal reactant minimization algorithm, GORMA, for sample preparation on digital microfluidic biochips. GORMA adopts a systematic method to exhaustively check all possible dilution solutions and then identifies the one with minimal reactant usage and waste through maximal droplet sharing. Experimental results show that GORMA outperforms all the existing methods in reactant usage. Meanwhile, the waste amount is reduced up to 30\% as compared with existing waste minimization methods. Moreover, GORMA requires only 0.6\% more operations on average when compared with an operation-minimal dilution method.},

It eliminates the need for post-CMOS processing and can scale up in numbers with the CMOS scaling. The presented design employs silane-mediated transfer of patterned gold electrode lines onto PDMS microfluidics such that the gold conformally coats the inside of microfluidic channel. Access to this electrode network is made possible by using ``through-PDMS-vias'' (TPV), which consist of high metal-coated SU-8 pillars manufactured by a novel process that employs a patterned positive resist layer as SU-8 adhesion depressor. When integrated with pneumatic valves, TPV and pseudo-RE network were able to bias 1.5 nanoliters (nL) of isolated electrolyte volumes. We present a detailed characterization of our pseudo-RE design demonstrating ISFET operation and its DC characterization. The stability of pseudo-RE is investigated by measuring open circuit potential (OCP) against a commercial Ag/AgCl reference electrode.},

Different camera elaboration processes were investigated, showing how direct access to the 10-bit raw data acquired from the sensor before downstream imaging processes could be beneficial for photometric applications.

Owing to its simplicity and effectiveness, electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) is one of the most commonly studied and applied effects to implement DMF. However, complex biomedical assays usually require more sophisticated sample handling and detection capabilities than basic EWOD manipulation. Alternatively, combined systems integrating EWOD actuators and other fluidic handling techniques are essential for bringing DMF into practical use. In this paper, we briefly review the main approaches for the integration/combination of EWOD with other microfluidic manipulation methods or additional external fields for specified biomedical applications. The form of integration ranges from independently operating sub-systems to fully coupled hybrid actuators.

This approach is, in essence, casting PDMS materials with the mold which is printed. The paper also includes our on-going effort on the printed mold approach. The main contribution of this paper is the identification of knowledge gaps and elaboration of future work toward closing the knowledge gaps in fabrication of PDMS microfluidic devices. The second contribution is the development of a novel classification of AM processes from design thinking. There is also a contribution in clarifying confusion in the literature regarding the soft lithography technique; this classification has provided a consistent ontology in the sub-field of the fabrication of microfluidic devices involving AM processes.},

Despite recent advances in microreactor technologies, seamlessly integrating reactions and work-up toward a fully-automated chemical synthesis platform is an unmet challenge. In this study, we have demonstrated an electrowetting-ondielectric (EWOD) digital microfluidic device (DMF) as an efficient in-line work-up tool for organic chemical synthesis reactions. The model protocol performed on EWOD DMF involves an acid-base workup, liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), and in-line solvent-swap. Device operation parameters of each reactant and unit process have been optimized. This study manifests the capacity of an EWOD device to transform into a drug discovery platform, particularly by hosting synthetically important reactions that require complicated work-up sequences.},

  abstract = {Microfluidics is a rapidly growing discipline that involves studying and manipulating fluids at reduced length scale and volume, typically on the scale of micro- or nanoliters. Under the reduced length scale and larger surface-to-volume ratio, advantages of low reagent consumption, faster reaction kinetics, and more compact systems are evident in microfluidics. However, miniaturization of microfluidic chips and systems introduces challenges of stricter tolerances in designing and controlling them for interdisciplinary applications. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have brought innovation to microfluidics from design, simulation, automation, and optimization to bioanalysis and data analytics. In microfluidics, the Navier--Stokes equations, which are partial differential equations describing viscous fluid motion that in complete form are known to not have a general analytical solution, can be simplified and have fair performance through numerical approximation due to low inertia and laminar flow. Approximation using neural networks trained by rules of physical knowledge introduces a new possibility to predict the physicochemical nature. The combination of microfluidics and automation can produce large amounts of data, where features and patterns that are difficult to discern by a human can be extracted by machine learning. Therefore, integration with AI introduces the potential to revolutionize the microfluidic workflow by enabling the precision control and automation of data analysis. Deployment of smart microfluidics may be tremendously beneficial in various applications in the future, including high-throughput drug discovery, rapid point-of-care-testing (POCT), and personalized medicine. In this review, we summarize key microfluidic advances integrated with AI and discuss the outlook and possibilities of combining AI and microfluidics.},

  abstract = {In this work, a screen-printed electrochemical detector with electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) digital microtluidics lab on a chip was designed, fabricated, and experimental studied for biological, biomedical, and chemical analysis. For the design, the electrochemical EWOD digital microtluidics system consists of T-junction EWOD microchip for merging buffer reagent and analyte droplets and three screen printed electrochemical detectors at the end of T-junction. The detectors consist of three electrodes: carbon working electrode, carbon counter electrode and silver/silver chloride reference electrode with minimal reagent consumption and rapid analysis. The systems has been successfully fabricated and tested for rapid analysis. In experiment, the electrochemical detector with EWOD microchip was fabricated and tested to control moving (merging and transporting) droplet on the microchip to analyte at three electrochemical detector. For analysis, the electrochemical detectors was demonstrated for minimal reagent consumption which were potassium ferricyanide and L-ascorbic. The concentration of the reagent were varied from 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 mM for analysis. Microdroplets of buffer reagent and analyte droplet solution was mixed and detected by cyclic voltammetry. The total analysis time including droplet mixing and measurement was less than 20 seconds.},

Digital microfluidics system has extended the scope of microfluidics by providing automated, precise flow control for point-of-care devices capable of medical diagnostics, environmental, and chemical sensing platforms. In this paper, we introduce a digital microfluidics platform based on electrowetting on a dielectric using PCB substrate designed on Easy EDA software. The platform's performance was analyzed at various DC voltages between 200 V and 400 V for droplet actuation. PCB fabrication, the utilization of easily accessible and cheap materials such as cooking oil and grafting tape as a dielectric layer, allowed the fabrication to be affordable and simple. The results indicate that droplet actuation takes place at 220 V. The droplet velocity obtained was 2.6 mm/s and 1.51 mm/s using silicon oil and cooking oil, respectively, at 400 V. Our proposed digital microfluidics platform will play a vital role in droplet actuation and can be used for diagnostic applications such as DNA analysis and cell culture due to its simple fabrication and cost-effective technique.},

Recently, open-source platforms have gained considerable popularity among tech-savvy chemists because their implementation often does not require expert knowledge and investment of funds. Thus, chemistry students and researchers can easily start implementing them after a few hours of reading tutorials and trial-and-error. Single-board microcontrollers and micro-computers such as Arduino, Teensy, Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone enable collecting experimental data with high precision as well as efficient control of electric potentials and actuation of mechanical systems. They are readily programmed using high-level languages, such as C, C++, JavaScript or Python. They can also be coupled with mobile consumer electronics, including smartphones as well as teleinformatic networks. More demanding analytical tasks require fast signal processing. Field-programmable gate arrays enable efficient and inexpensive prototyping of high-performance analytical platforms, thus becoming increasingly popular among analytical chemists.

We fabricated a 5 {\texttimes} 5 array of individually controlled electrowetting cells to manipulate silicone oil droplets via EWOD. The fabrication process utilized exclusively flexible materials to improve the robustness of the overall device, and processing methods were adapted to accommodate the particular challenges posed by flexible materials. Simulation of the EWOD devices was conducted using ANSYS Fluent and showed the change in contact angle in response to voltage applied. Fabricated devices were also tested, with actuation of the oil droplet observed with up to 100 V (RMS) AC applied across underlying electrodes. We demonstrated fabrication of a fully flexible array and verified actuation to center droplets over the electrodes. This work may be expanded to address more specific flexible applications for EWOD.},

We demonstrate droplet transport on centimeter-scale distances at speeds of 0.1 to 1 mm{$\cdot$} s-1 with well-programmable, sequential or parallel, fusion events. Because our strategy is compatible with most usual hydrocarbon solvents, such droplets can be used as microcompartments for reagents. Organic reactions readily occur upon droplet fusion, as demonstrated with an ene reaction. With an LED as the sole power source, and without any fabrication step, optical setup, pump or electrode implementation, our method provides a robust and versatile way to place digital organic chemistry under optical control.},

Nevertheless, research on the analytical performance of those systems is limited, yet crucial for a further breakthrough in the diagnostic field. Therefore, this paper presents the intrinsic possibilities of an EWOD lab-on-a-chip as a versatile platform for homogeneous and heterogeneous bio-assays with high analytical performance. Both droplet dispensing and splitting cause variations in droplet size, thereby directly influencing the assay's performance. The extent to which they influence the performance is assessed by a theoretical sensitivity analysis, which allows the definition of a basic framework for the reduction of droplet size variability. Taking advantage of the optimized droplet manipulations, both homogeneous and heterogeneous bio-assays are implemented in the EWOD lab-on-a-chip to demonstrate the analytical capabilities and versatility of the device. A fully on-chip enzymatic assay is realized with high analytical performance. It demonstrates the promising capabilities of an EWOD lab-on-a-chip in food-related and medical applications, such as nutritional and blood analyses. Further, a magnetic bio-assay for IgE detection using superparamagnetic nanoparticles is presented whereby the nanoparticles are used as solid carriers during the bio-assay. Crucial elements are the precise manipulation of the superparamagnetic nanoparticles with respect to dispensing and separation. Although the principle of using nano-carriers is demonstrated for protein detection, it can be easily extended to a broader range of bio-related applications like DNA sensing. In heterogeneous bio-assays the chip surface is actively involved during the execution of the bio-assay. Through immobilization of specific biological compounds like DNA, proteins and cells a reactive chip surface is realized, which enhances the bio-assay performance. To demonstrate this potential, on-chip adhesion islands are fabricated to immobilize MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Viability studies are performed to assess the functionalization efficiency.},

  abstract = {A new feedback and biological analysis system for digital microfluidics that uses an imaging based setup.           ,              Digital microfluidics (DMF) is a technology that provides a means of manipulating nL--{$\mu$}L volumes of liquids on an array of electrodes. By applying an electric potential to an electrode, these discrete droplets can be controlled in parallel which can be transported, mixed, reacted, and analyzed. Typically, an automation system is interfaced with a DMF device that uses a standard set of basic instructions written by the user to execute droplet operations. Here, we present the first feedback method for DMF that relies on imaging techniques that will allow online detection of droplets without the need to reactivate all destination electrodes. Our system consists of integrating open-source electronics with a CMOS camera and a zoom lens for acquisition of the images that will be used to detect droplets on the device. We also created an algorithm that uses a Hough transform to detect a variety of droplet sizes and to detect singular droplet dispensing and movement failures on the device. As a first test, we applied this feedback system to test droplet movement for a variety of liquids used in cell-based assays and to optimize different feedback actuation schemes to improve droplet movement fidelity. We also applied our system to a colorimetric enzymatic assay to show that our system is capable of biological analysis. Overall, we believe that using our approach of integrating imaging and feedback for DMF can provide a platform for automating biological assays with analysis.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In recent years, microfluidic technologies have emerged as a powerful approach for the advanced synthesis and rapid optimization of various solution-processed nanomaterials, including semiconductor quantum dots and nanoplatelets, and metal plasmonic and reticular framework nanoparticles. These fluidic systems offer access to previously unattainable measurements and synthesis conditions at unparalleled efficiencies and sampling rates. Despite these advantages, microfluidic systems have yet to be extensively adopted by the colloidal nanomaterial community. To help bridge the gap, this progress report details the basic principles of microfluidic reactor design and performance, as well as the current state of online diagnostics and autonomous robotic experimentation strategies, toward the size, shape, and composition-controlled synthesis of various colloidal nanomaterials. By discussing the application of fluidic platforms in recent high-priority colloidal nanomaterial studies and their potential for integration with rapidly emerging artificial intelligence-based decision-making strategies, this report seeks to encourage interdisciplinary collaborations between microfluidic reactor engineers and colloidal nanomaterial chemists. Full convergence of these two research efforts offers significantly expedited and enhanced nanomaterial discovery, optimization, and manufacturing.},

Prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics minimises illness severity, but presentation to health care facilities is often delayed because of the non-specific nature of the symptoms and the lack of reliable diagnostic tests. Disease prevention requires significant investment in provision of clean water and sanitation in the long term; vaccination offers a more realistic strategy for medium term control. However, implementation of existing vaccines and development of more efficacious vaccines has been hindered by the lack of an established correlate of protection and under appreciation of the true disease burden.

During design and testing of new microfluidic systems, rapid and frequent design modifications have to be carried out. For this purpose, a device using maskless projection lithography based on a digital mirror device (DMD) has been developed. Digital mask layouts may be created using any graphics program (Microsoft Paint, Adobe Photoshop) and can be used as such by the custom-written control software of the system. However, we suggest using another approach: direct importing of three-dimensional digital computer-aided design (CAD) models from which mask information can be directly parsed. This process is advantageous as commercial 3D-CAD systems allow the rapid generation of static or parameterized models which can be used for computerized analyses like, e.g., flow simulation. After model validation, the mask information is extracted from these models and directly used by the lithography device. A chip or replication master is then created by means of lithography using curable monomers or resists as, e.g., Accura 60 or SU-8. With CAMF, the whole process from digital 3D model creation to actually running the experiment can be done within a day.},

We model the fluid dynamics by using Hele--Shaw type equations with a focus on including the relevant boundary phenomena. Specifically, we show that contact angle saturation and hysteresis are needed to predict the correct shape and time scale of droplet motion. We demonstrate this by comparing our simulation to experimental data for a splitting droplet. Without these boundary effects, the simulation shows the droplet splitting into three pieces instead of two and the motion is over 15 times faster than the experiment. We then show how including the saturation characteristics of the device, and a simple model of contact angle hysteresis, allows the simulation to better predict the splitting experiment. The match is not perfect and suffers mainly because contact line pinning is not included. This is followed by a comparison between our simulation, whose parameters are now frozen, and a new experiment involving bulk droplet motion. Our numerical implementation uses the level set method, is fast, and is being used to design algorithms for the precise control of microdroplet motion, mixing, and splitting.},

To tackle this, here we design and construct a liquid-based microfluidic molecular communication platform for performing chemical concentration signal processing and digital signal transmission over distances. By specifically designing chemical reactions and microfluidic geometry, the transmitter of our platform is capable of shaping the emitted signals, and the receiver is able to threshold, amplify, and detect the chemical signals after propagation. By encoding bit information into the concentration of sodium hydroxide, we demonstrate that our platform can achieve molecular signal modulation and demodulation functionalities, and reliably transmit text messages over long distances. This platform is further optimised to maximise data rate while minimising communication error. The presented methodology for real-time chemical signal processing can enable the implementation of signal processing units in biological settings and then unleash its potential for interdisciplinary applications.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a new efficient in-droplet magnetic particle concentration and separation method, where magnetic particles are concentrated and separated into a split droplet by using a permanent magnet and EWOD (electrowetting on dielectric) droplet manipulation. To evaluate the method, testing devices are fabricated by the micro fabrication technology. First, this method is examined for magnetic particle concentration, showing that over 91\% of magnetic particles can be concentrated into a split daughter droplet. Then, separation between magnetic and non-magnetic particles is examined for two different cases of particle mixture, showing in both cases that over 91\% of the magnetic particles can be concentrated into split daughter droplets. However, a significant number of the non-magnetic particles (over 35\%) co-exist with the magnetic particles in the same daughter droplets. This problem is circumvented by adding a droplet-merging step prior to applying the magnetic field. Finally, over 94\% of the total magnetic particles are separated into a one split daughter droplet while 92\% of the non-magnetic particles into the other split daughter droplet. This integrated in-droplet separation method may bridge many existing magnetic particle assays to digital microfluidics and extend their application scope.},

  abstract = {In order to get rid of the dependence on expensive photolithography technology and related facilities, an economic and simple design and fabrication technology for digital microfluidics (DMF) is proposed. The electrodes pattern was generated by inkjet printing nanosilver conductive ink on the flexible Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate with a 3D circuit board printer, food wrap film was attached to the electrode array to act as the dielectric layer and Teflon{\textregistered} AF was sprayed to form a hydrophobic layer. The PET substrate and food wrap film are low cost and accessible to general users. The proposed flexible DMF chips can be reused for a long time by replacing the dielectric film coated with hydrophobic layer. The resolution and conductivity of silver traces and the contact angle and velocity of the droplets were evaluated to demonstrate that the proposed technology is comparable to the traditional DMF fabrication process. As far as the rapid prototyping of DMF is concerned, this technology has shown very attractive advantages in many aspects, such as fabrication cost, fabrication time, material selection and mass production capacity, without sacrificing the performance of DMF. The flexible DMF chips have successfully implemented basic droplet operations on a square and hexagon electrode array.},

In this study, a lab-on-chip device was developed for rapid, automatic and sensitive detection of viable               Salmonella typhimurium               using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and smartphone real-time turbidity monitoring. First, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) coated with anti-               Salmonella               capture antibodies in propidium monoazide (PMA) were fully mixed with bacterial samples using two active magnetic stirring mixers at reverse rotating directions, and incubated in the serpentine channel with 470 nm blue light exposure, allowing specific formation of magnetic bacteria and sufficient PMA pretreatment of the DNA of dead bacteria. Then, the PMA-treated magnetic bacteria were separated in the separation chamber using the magnetic field and their genomic DNA templates were extracted using lysis buffer at 70 {$^\circ$}C. Finally, the viable bacteria's DNA was amplified using LAMP in the detection chamber preloaded with the lyophilized LAMP reagents at 67.5 {$^\circ$}C after blocking with paraffin oil to avoid aerosol cross contamination. Finally, the turbidity of the LAMP reaction system was monitored in a real-time manner for the quantitative detection of viable bacteria. The experimental results demonstrated that this device was able to automatically detect viable               Salmonella               as low as 14 CFU mL               -1               in spiked chicken meat supernatants within 1.5 h. This device is very promising to provide a sample-in-result-out solution for the in-field detection of               Salmonella               and could be easily extended for other foodborne pathogens.},

Catering to the demand of Big Data Era, fast reactions for single cells and paralleled high-throughput analysis have become an urgent need. Microdroplet in microfluidics has advantages of modularity and integrity, as well as high throughput and sensitivity, which present great potential in the field of single-cell analysis. This review is carried out on three aspects to introduce microdroplet chips for single-cell analysis: droplet formation, droplet detection and practical functions. Structures of droplet formation are categorized into three types, including T-shaped channel, flow-involved channel and three-dimensional micro-vortice. The detection methods, including fluorescence, Raman spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy and electrochemical detection, are summarized from applications. Both pros and cons for existing techniques are reviewed and discussed. The functions of microdroplets-on-chip cover cell culture, nucleic acid test and cell identification. For each field, principles/mechanisms and/or schematic images are laconically introduced. Microdroplet in microfluidics has become a major research direction in single-cell analysis. With updated methods of droplet formation such as inertial ordering and micro-vortice, microdroplets-based biochips will expect high throughput detection and high-accuracy trace detection for clinical diagnosis in the near future.},

  abstract = {Developments of portable biosensors for field-deployable detections have been increasingly important to control foodborne pathogens in regulatory environment and in early stage of outbreaks. Conventional cultivation and gene amplification methods require sophisticated instruments and highly skilled professionals; while portable biosensing devices provide more freedom for rapid detections not only in research laboratories but also in the field; however, their sensitivity and specificity are limited. Microfluidic methods have the advantage of miniaturizing instrumental size while integrating multiple functions and high-throughput capability into one streamlined system at low cost. Minimal sample consumption is another advantage to detect samples in different sizes and concentrations, which is important for the close monitoring of pathogens at consumer end. They improve measurement or manipulation of bacteria by increasing the ratio of functional interface of the device to the targeted biospecies and in turn reducing background interference. This article introduces the major active and passive microfluidic devices that have been used for bacteria sampling and biosensing. The emphasis is on particle-based sorting/enrichment methods with or without external physical fields applied to the microfluidic devices and on various biosensing applications reported for bacteria sampling. Three major fabrication methods for microfluidics are briefly discussed with their advantages and limitations. The applications of these active and passive microfluidic sampling methods in the past 5 years have been summarized, with the focus on Escherichia coli and Salmonella. The current challenges to microfluidic bacteria sampling are caused by the small size and nonspherical shape of various bacterial cells, which can induce unpredictable deviations in sampling and biosensing processes. Future studies are needed to develop rapid prototyping methods for device manufacturing, which can facilitate rapid response to various foodborne pathogen outbreaks.},

Molecular diagnostics are widely used in microfluidic devices as the most effective approaches for pathogen detec-tion. This review summarizes the latest advances in microfluidics-based molecular diagnostics for infectious diseases from academic perspectives and industrial outlooks. First, we introduce the typical on-chip nucleic acid processes, including sample preprocessing, amplification, and signal read-out. Then, four categories of microfluidic platforms are compared with respect to features, merits, and demerits. We further discuss application of the digital assay in absolute nucleic acid quantification. Both the classic and recent microfluidics-based commercial molecular diagnostic devices are summarized as proof of the current market status. Finally, we propose future directions for microfluidics-based infectious disease diagnosis.},

There are very high requirements for the volume of single droplet in many biochemical applications. Droplet dispensing and splitting are two main operations to generate a single droplet in DMF. Therefore, the generation of droplets with high volume precision and accuracy in the two droplet operations is one of the keys to the efficient application of DMF in biochemical analysis. We have developed a novel droplet dispensing and splitting scheme where electrode geometry is optimized. The liquid column can contract in a regular shape, which keep the neck shape uniform and stable, and the position of pinch-off point was fixed; meanwhile, the liquid tail is eliminated before pinching off, so that the precision and accuracy of droplet volume were greatly improved. The increase in the radius of the cutting electrodes elongated the droplet neck and increased the neck curvature at the pinch-off point, which further effectively improved the precision and accuracy of droplet volume. The optimized droplet splitting scheme can also be applied to the droplet splitting with unequal volume effectively.},

  abstract = {The current widespread of COVID-19 all over the world, which is caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, has again emphasized the importance of development of point-of-care (POC) diagnostics for timely prevention and control of the pandemic. Compared with labor- and time-consuming traditional diagnostic methods, POC diagnostics exhibit several advantages such as faster diagnostic speed, better sensitivity and specificity, lower cost, higher efficiency and ability of on-site detection. To achieve POC diagnostics, developing POC detection methods and correlated POC devices is the key and should be given top priority. The fast de\- velopment of microfluidics, micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology, nanotechnology and materials science, have benefited the production of a series of portable, miniaturized, low cost and highly integrated POC devices for POC diagnostics of various infectious diseases. In this review, various POC de\- tection methods for the diagnosis of infectious diseases, including electrochemical biosensors, fluorescence biosensors, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based biosensors, colorimetric biosensors, chemi\- luminiscence biosensors, surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based biosensors, and magnetic biosensors, were first summarized. Then, recent progresses in the development of POC devices including lab-on-a-chip (LOC) devices, lab-on-a-disc (LOAD) devices, microfluidic paper-based analytical devices ({$\mu$}PADs), lateral flow devices, miniaturized PCR devices, and isothermal nucleic acid amplification (INAA) devices, were systematically discussed. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives for the design and development of POC detection methods and correlated devices were presented. The ultimate goal of this review is to provide new insights and directions for the future development of POC diagnostics for the management of infectious diseases and contribute to the prevention and control of infectious pandemics like COVID-19.},

  abstract = {The past two decades witnessed the widespread adoption of microfluidics for miniaturized and automated chemical analysis. Microfluidic techniques require less sample, consume less reagents, and may enhance the sensitivity, precision, response time, and throughput of the analytical methods. The integration of multiple components and functionalities in microfluidic chips can further lead to fully automated Micro Total Analysis Systems (Lab-on-a-Chip). This review focuses on chemical and biochemical sensing of inorganic ions including electrolyte cations, heavy metal ions, and small anions in microfluidic devices. We provide an overview on how different optical and electrochemical ion sensing schemes based on liquid sensing phases or solid sensing phases can be coupled with microfluidics. Various microfluidics platforms including continuous-flow microfluidics, droplet microfluidics, digital microfluidics, centrifugal microfluidics, cell-based microfluidics, paper-based microfluidics, and wearable microfluidics are covered. The sensing principle, chip material, device fabrica\- tion, detector configuration, and analytical performance are presented for selected systems. This review con\- cludes with a brief outlook on how microfluidic ion sensors may be further advanced.},

Conventionally, digital microfluidic operations are performed on a two-dimensional electrode array. This research expands the two-dimensional conventional digital microfluidic architecture into a three-dimensional architecture. The concept relies on the possibility that back and forth motions between open and covered regions are possible under electrowetting actuation. Two face-to-face plates based on "microelectrode dot array" (MEDA) architecture form the foundation of the two-layer microfluidic operations and a dual open/covered hybrid design adds the inter\- layer microfluidic connection to complete the three-dimensional system. By combining the advantages of the open/covered systems, a three-dimensional digital microfluidics may achieve better droplet routing capabilities and fit more functions into a given footprint.},

  abstract = {Wetting and electrowetting (EW) on corrugated substrates are studied experimentally and theoretically in this paper. On corrugated substrates, because of the anisotropy of surface morphology, the droplet shows an elliptical shape and the spreading velocities in different directions are different. Spreading of a droplet is usually controlled not only by the surface tensions but also by hemi-wicking. Our experimental results indicated that liquids along the grooves propagate much faster than those in the direction vertical to the grooves. However, spreading in both directions obeys the same scaling law of l{$\sim$}t4/5. EW on corrugated substrates reveals some differences with that on smooth surfaces. The change of contact angles with an applied voltage follows a linear relationship in two stages instead of the smooth curve on flat surfaces. There exists a critical voltage which divides the two stages. The transition of a droplet from the Cassie state to the Wenzel state on corrugated substrates was also discussed. The extended EW equation was derived with the free energy minimization approach, and the anisotropic factor was introduced. From the extended equation, it is found that EW is affected by the anisotropic factor significantly. For the smooth surfaces, the extended EW equation will degenerate to the classical Lippmann-Young equation. Our research may help us to understand the wetting and EW of droplets on corrugated substrates and assist in their design for practical applications.},

Microfluidics, which involves the manipulation of small volumes of fluidic samples, has been shown to be an ideal approach for POC analysis. Among the various microfluidic platforms available, digital microfluidics (DMF) offers high degree of configurability in manipu\- lating {$\mu$}L/nL-scale liquid and achieving automation. However, the successful implementation of ultrafast PCR on DMF platforms presents challenges due to inherent system instability. In this study, we developed a robust and ultrafast PCR in 3.7--5 min with a detection sensitivity comparable to conventional PCR. Specifically, the implementation of the pincer heating scheme homogenises the temperature within a drop. The utilization of a {$\mu$}m-scale porous hydrophobic membrane suppresses the formation of bubbles under high temperatures. The design of a groove around the high-temperature zone effectively mitigates the temperature interference. The integration of a soluble sensor into the droplets provides an accurate and instant in-drop temperature sensing. We envision that the fast, robust, sensitive, and automatic DMF system will empower the POC testing for infectious diseases.},

Aiming to decrease driving voltages and improve driving effectiveness, this paper studies the modeling, simulation, and optimization of EWOD devices. The theoretical model is refined mainly in consideration of the saturation effect of the contact angle and then verified by both simulation and experiments. As a design guide to decrease the driving voltage, a theoretical criterion of droplet splitting, the most difficult one among four basic droplet manipulations, is developed and then verified by experimental results. Moreover, a novel sigmoid electrode shape is found by the optimization method based on finite element analysis and achieves better driving effectiveness and consistent bidirectional driving capability, compared with the existing electrode shapes. Taken together, this paper provides an EWOD analysis and optimization method featuring a lower voltage and a better effectiveness and opens up opportunities for optimization designs in various EWOD-based applications.},

The designed electrode is in a meander-line shape and covered by an insulator. On the one hand, when a potential difference is applied along the electrode, power dissipated by the resistance of the electrode causes droplet heating. On the other hand, when an electric field exists across the insulator above the electrode, the charges stored in the capacitor alter the surface wettability and pump droplet. Manipulated droplets were placed between parallel plates with passivated versatile microelectrodes on the bottom plate and a Teflon-coated blank ITO on the top plate. We successfully applied a DC voltage at the two terminals of the meander-line electrode to heat up the electrode as well as the droplet above. Besides, pumping droplets by EWOD was demonstrated by applying a proper AC voltage between the electrode on the bottom plate and the ITO on the top plate. With the proposed versatile microelectrode design and actuation scheme, heating and EWOD were obtained on an identical electrode.

Pyrosequencing utilizes pyrophosphate produced during nucleotide base addition to initiate a process ending with detection through a chemiluminescence reaction using firefly luciferase. The intensity of light produced during the reaction can be quantified to determine the number of bases added to the DNA strand. The logic-based control and discrete fluid droplets of a digital microfluidic device lend themselves well to the pyrosequencing process. Bead-bound DNA is magnetically held in a single location, and wash or reagent droplets added or split from it to circumvent product dilution. Here we discuss the dispensing, control, and magnetic manipulation of the paramagnetic beads used to hold target DNA. We also demonstrate and characterize the picoliter-scale reaction of luciferase with adenosine triphosphate to represent the detection steps of pyrosequencing and all necessary alterations for working on this scale.},

  abstract = {Foodborne pathogens endanger human health. Therefore, sensitive and accurate detection assays are key for their prevention and control. Microdroplet digital nucleic acid platforms can achieve single-molecule sensitivity in the presence of specialized instrumentation for generating homogenized monodisperse droplets, expensive thermal cyclers, high temperature-resistant reagents, and time-consuming multistep operations in the lab. Argonaute (Ago), an emerging next-generation gene editing tool, can be used for the detection of pathogen genetic information. Current reports mainly adopt the high temperature-dependent thermophilic Ago in stepwise nucleic acid detection, which hinders its applications in ultrasensitive digital detection. Here, we expressed and purified the mesophilic Clostridium butyricum Argonaute (CbAgo) and developed a polydisperse microdroplet reactors-assist asymmetric recombinase polymerase amplification driven CbAgo report digital detection platform (DRAGON). It realized the signal-enhanced nucleic acid amplification and CbAgo report compatibility in novel low-cost and ultrafast-prepared polydisperse microdroplet reactors. The microdroplet reactor area and fluores\- cence intensity were combined to establish a dual parameter-based random forest machine learning model, which achieved high sensitivity (1 CFU/mL) and efficiency ({$<$}45 min) for detecting pathogens. This is the first time that mesophilic Ago was used to achieve true sensitive one-step and one-pot low-temperature digital nucleic acid detection. Our system accomplished multiplex detection in one-step and one-pot with a single nuclease which is impossible for CRISPR/Cas system and thermophilic Ago-based stepwise platforms. DRAGON represents the next-generation platform for pathogen detection based on gene editing tools and intelligent digital nucleic acid detection system.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Droplet control through the use of light-induced thermocapillary effects has recently garnered attention due to its non-intrusive and multifunctional nature. An important issue in droplet control is the estimation of the thermocapillary force. The purpose of the present study is to estimate the thermocapillary force and propose empirical equations between the force and simply measurable key parameters such as droplet diameter and power of heat source. In addition, we aim to shift the droplet trajectory and develop an on-demand droplet routing system based on the estimation of the thermocapillary force. We illuminated a continuous phase with a 532\,nm laser beam to minimize possible damage or property changes to target molecules contained within droplets. A mixture of light-absorbing material and oleic acid was used for the continuous phase fluid, while deionized water (DI water) was used for the dispersed phase fluid. We proposed empirical equations to estimate the thermocapillary force, which was then applied to precise droplet shifting and routing. We found that the shifting distance was linearly proportional to the thermocapillary force, and that an on-demand droplet routing system resulted in a success rate greater than 95\%.},

  abstract = {Fast advancements of microfabrication processes in past two decades have reached to a fairly matured stage that we can manufacture a wide range of microfluidic devices. At present, the main challenge is the control of nanoscale properties on the surface of lab-on-a-chip to satisfy the need for biomedical applications. For example, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) is a commonly used material for microfluidic circuitry, yet the hydrophobic nature of PDMS surface suffers serious nonspecific protein adsorption. Thus the current major efforts are focused on surface molecular property treatments for satisfying specific needs in handling macro functional molecules. Reviewing surface modifications of all types of materials used in microfluidics will be too broad. This review will only summarize recent advances in nonbiofouling PDMS surface modification strategies applicable to microfluidic technology and classify them into two main categories: (1) physical approach including physisorption of charged or amphiphilic polymers and copolymers, as well as (2) chemical approach including self assembled monolayer and thick polymer coating. Pros and cons of a collection of available yet fully exploited surface modification methods are briefly compared among subcategories.},

  abstract = {Electrically-driven droplet-based digital microfluidics analog to integrated chips has undergone tremendous growth; however, its applications are restricted due to high-voltage requirement and lack of versatile droplet manipulation methods. We propose liquid dielectrophoresis on electret (L-DEPOE) as a CMOS-driven general droplet manipulation method for various conductive or dielectric droplets. By mimicking electric relays to operate the electret as a virtual voltage source with a low-voltage signal, L-DEPOE dramatically reduces the driving voltage to only 5 VDC for transporting oil droplets. The driving force in liquid dielectrophoresis (L-DEP) is compared with dielectrophoresis (DEP) and electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) in a unified approach by introducing the concept of electropolarization in non-uniform electric fields. In this scenario, molecular electropolarization forces act in dielectric liquid bulk for L-DEP, in the electrical double layer (EDL) near the three-phase contact line for EWOD. The vanishing of electropolarization forces may contribute to the contact angle (CA) saturation in EWOD. The apparent CA reduction in EWOD is formulated within the classical electromechanical framework as a consequence of electropolarization forces in the EDL. To electrically manipulate various liquids, we transported both conductive water and dielectric oil droplets in the same L-DEPOE configuration using external voltages, and we propose a modified configuration for tuning liquid shapes. Improved results on electret charge stability are presented, and approaches to enhance electret performances and droplet motion velocity are analyzed based on qualitative analysis and quantitative simulation.},

By employing electret as a virtual voltage source embedded into microfluidics for the first time, a dielectric droplet between two electrodes can be transported by liquid dielectrophoresis (L-DEP) force when switching an external capacitor between electrodes using a manual switch or low-voltage-driven relays. A circuit model and force analysis for L-DEPOE are established to clarify its working principle and quantitatively depict the droplet motion. Nanoliter dielectric droplets have been transported reversibly between the two electrodes with a manual switch or five DCV-driven relays in microfabricated proof-of-concept prototypes. The surface voltage stability of electret in liquid is examined with different polymer materials and coatings. Furthermore, the droplet motion traces in a L-DEPOE device are compared with numerical simulation results, indicating the important role of contact angle hysteresis for nanoliter droplets.},

Capillary, planar, and terrace droplet generation systems are currently used in the design of microfluidic devices, each with their strengths and weaknesses as applied in food processing, for emulsification, food safety measurements, and bioactive compound extraction. Conventional channel-based microfluidic devices are prone to clogging, and have high labor costs and low productivity, and their ``directional pressure'' restricts scaling-up capabilities. These disadvantages can be overcome by using ``inside-out centrifugal force'' and the new generation continuous flow thin-film microfluidic Vortex Fluidic Device (VFD) which facilitates translating laboratory processing into commercial products.

Prototypes of PCB-based 1002F and polyurethane microfluidics were fabricated with electronic components embedded for integration (resistors, LEDs, temperature sensors), enabling on-board thermal control and detection, and optical imaging. In this paper, optical imaging was presented as a demonstration for such on-board functional control. Electroosmotic flow was measured in microchannels made from both materials, demonstrating the suitability of these materials for biochemical and electrochemical applications.},

At Reynolds numbers far below 1 (Re {$\ll$} 1), the fluid inertia can be neglected. For the steady flow of incompressible Newtonian fluids, it approaches linear Stokes flow. At intermediate Re, there exists a weak-inertia flow regime where secondary flows such as Dean vortices are accessible for microfluidic manipulations. Apart from the fluid inertia, other nonlinear factors such as the non-Newtonian fluid properties, concurrent flow of dissimilar fluids, compliant fluidic structures and stimuli-responsive materials can also cause intriguing flow behaviours. Through proper designs, they can be applied for a variety of microfluidic components including mixers, valves, oscillators, stabilizers and auto-regulators               etc.               , greatly enriching the microfluidic flow control and manipulation strategies.

DMFB that uses crossreferencing technology to drive droplets movements scales down the control pin number on chip, which not only brings down manufacturing cost but also allows large-scale chip design. However, the cross-referencing scheme that imposes different voltage on rows and columns to activate the cells, might cause severe electrode interference, and hence greatly decreases the degree of parallelism of droplet routing. Most of the previous papers get a directaddressing result first, and then convert to cross-referencing compatible result. This paper proposes a new method that solves the droplet routing problem on cross-referencing biochip directly. Experimental results on public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method in comparison with the latest work on this problem.},

  abstract = {Computer-aided design problems of digital microfluidic biochips are receiving much attention, and most of the previous works focus on direct-addressing biochips. In this paper, we solve the placement and droplet routing problem in cross-referencing biochips. In these biochips, the electrodes are addressed in a row-column manner, which may cause electrode interference that prevents simultaneous movements of multiple droplets. We propose a routing algorithm that solves the droplet routing problem directly. A two-coloring graph-theoretic method is used in our router to detect and prevent the electrode interference. In addition, we propose an integer linear programming based method to solve the placement problem. Our method considers the characteristics of cross-referencing biochips and is aware of droplet routing. Real-life benchmarks are used to evaluate the proposed methods. Compared with previous works, our router improves on average 4\% in routing time and 58\% in runtime. It can route all the benchmarks within the time limits, while the latest work fails in some cases. Moreover, experimental results show that by running our router on the placement result generated by our method and those generated by the latest work, an average improvement of 11\%, 29\%, 54\%, and 46\% in the maximum routing time, average routing time, stalling steps, and cell usage can be achieved.},

This technique features handling of many microfluidic operations simultaneously and uses on-chip sensors for diagnosis at run-time. Once a fault is detected during the droplet routing, recovery procedures will be started-up immediately. Faulty units on the chip will be marked and isolated from the array so that the remaining droplets can still be routed along a fault-free path to their destinations.

However, most microdevices only allow limited steps, such as DNA amplification on the chip, while sample preparation, such as lysis and DNA extraction, is conducted off the chip using the traditional method. In this study, an all-in-one platform was developed, which incorporated all necessary procedures for nucleic acid detection. Our on-chip DNA extraction method utilized the magnetic bead-based technology on a hybrid channel-digital microfluidics (C-DMF) microdevice. It yielded high recovery rates, varying from 88.43\% to 95.83\%, with pathogen concentrations of 103--106 CFU/mL. In particular, the on-chip method exhibited significantly higher efficacy compared to the traditional off-chip manual method, for the DNA extraction of E. coli and S. aureus, representing Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively, at a sample concentration of 103 CFU/mL. To address the need for rapid and accessible diagnostics, colorimetric LAMP amplification was integrated into the proposed microdevice. The results were visually detectable with the naked eye, making it user-friendly for non-specialists. In addition, this platform demonstrated impressive sensitivity in simultaneously detecting common foodborne pathogens in spiked meat samples, achieving the LOD of 102--103 CFU/mL. The entire process, from sampling to result, was fully automated and only required approximately 60 min, offering promising applicability in resource-limited and on-site testing scenarios.},

In this work we report the progress in addressing those issues by using active-matrix circuitry to automatically drive a large electrode array with enhanced device reliability. We describe the design and the fabrication of a robust and scalable active-matrix driven digital microfluidic platform based on printed-circuit board technology. Reliable actuation of aqueous and organic droplets is achieved using a free-standing double-layer hydrophobic membrane. To demonstrate the versatility of the digital microfluidic platform, a pentapeptide is synthesized on the device within 30 minutes.

We propose a dropletmanipulation method based on a ``cross-referencing'' addressing method that uses ``row'' and ``columns'' to access electrodes. By mapping the droplet-movement problem on a crossreferenced chip to the clique-partitioning problem from graph theory, the proposed method allows simultaneous movement of a large number of droplets on a microfluidic array. Concurrency is enhanced through the use of an efficient scheduling algorithm that determines the order in which groups of droplets are moved. The proposed design-automation method facilitates high-throughput applications on a pin-constrained biochip, and it is evaluated using random synthetic benchmarks and a set of multiplexed bioassays.},

Bioassays are mapped to microfluidic arrays using synthesis tools, and they are executed through the manipulation of sample and reagent droplets by electrical means. Most prior work on CAD for biochips has assumed independent control of electrodes using a large number of (electrical) input pins. Such solutions are not feasible for low-cost disposable biochips that are envisaged for many field applications. A more promising design strategy is to divide the microfluidic array into smaller partitions and use a small number of electrodes to control the electrodes in each partition. We propose a partitioning algorithm based on the concept of ``droplet trace'', which is extracted from the scheduling and droplet routing results produced by a synthesis tool. An efficient pin assignment method, referred to as the ``Connect-5 algorithm'', is combined with the array partitioning technique based on droplet traces. The array partitioning and pin assignment methods are evaluated using a set of multiplexed bioassays.},

First, immune magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), the sample, and immune MnO2 NFs were fully mixed and sufficiently incubated in the spiral micromixer to form MNP-bacteria-MnO2 sandwich complexes, which were magnetically captured in a separation chamber in the microfluidic chip. Then, a 3,3{$\prime$},5,5{$\prime$}-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate was injected and catalyzed by a MnO2 NF nanomimetic enzyme on the complexes, resulting in the production of yellow catalysate. Finally, the catalysate was transferred into a detection chamber and its image was measured and processed using the smartphone app to determine the number of bacteria. This biosensor was able to detect Salmonella from 4.4 {\texttimes} 101 to 4.4 {\texttimes} 106 CFU/mL in 45 min with a detection limit of 44 CFU/mL, and has the potential to provide a promising platform for on-site detection of foodborne bacteria.},

In this paper, we introduce the concept of functional testing of microfluidic biochips. We address fundamental biochip operations, such as droplet dispensing, droplet transportation, mixing, splitting, and capacitive sensing. Long electrode actuation times are avoided to ensure that there is no electrode degradation during testing. The functional testing of pin-constrained biochips is also studied.

As high-throughput bioassays are mapped to digital microfluidic platforms, the need for design automation techniques is being increasingly felt. Moreover, as most applications of biochips are safety-critical in nature, defect tolerance is an essential system attribute. Several synthesis tools have recently been proposed for the automated design of biochips from the specifications of laboratory protocols. However, only a few of these tools address the problem of defect tolerance. In addition, most of these methods do not consider the problem of droplet routing in microfluidic arrays. These methods typically rely on postsynthesis droplet routing to implement biochemical protocols. Such an approach is not only time consuming, but also imposes an undue burden on the chip user. Postsynthesis droplet routing does not guarantee that feasible droplet pathways can be found for area-constrained biochip layouts; nonroutable fabricated biochips must be discarded. We present a synthesis tool that integrates defect tolerance and droplet routing in the design flow. Droplet routability, defined as the ease with which droplet pathways can be determined, is estimated and integrated in the synthesis procedure. Presynthesis and postsynthesis defect-tolerance methods are also presented. We use a large-scale protein assay as a case study to evaluate the proposed synthesis method.},

A single planar EWOD device is fabricated for testing and placed in a high-humidity environment under mist flow. By applying an electric field to portions of the device, the wettability of the affected areas is altered from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, which promotes droplet nucleation and growth, thereby improving water capturing capability. The results of this study demonstrate that droplet coalescence is appreciably improved at the moments of plugging and unplugging DC voltage, which induces wipe-down events (when a droplet drips down the surface and removes all droplets underneath it). The improvement in water capturing capability under DC voltages of 20\,V, 40\,V, and 60\,V is also investigated both by comparing the mass of water collected on uncharged and charged devices during the same testing period and by using an image processing approach to track changes in droplet area coverage over time. The EWOD effect was shown to improve water capturing capability for the 20\,V, 40\,V, and 60\,V cases by 138.96\%, 171.87\%, and 220.43\%, respectively.

  abstract = {Various diseases caused by food-borne or environmental pathogenic microorganisms have been a persistent threat to public health and global economies. It is necessary to regularly detect microorganisms in food and environment to prevent infection of pathogenic microorganisms. However, most traditional detection methods are expensive, time-consuming, and unfeasible in practice in the absence of sophisticated instruments and trained operators. Point-of-care testing (POCT) can be used to detect microorganisms rapidly on site and greatly improve the efficiency of microbial detection. Lab-on-chip (LOC) is an emerging POCT technology with great potential by integrating most of the experimental steps carried out in the laboratory into a single monolithic device. This review will primarily focus on principles and techniques of LOC for detection of microbial nucleic acid in food and environment, including sample preparation, nucleic acid amplification and sample detection.},

A capacitive flow pattern sensor has been realized by employing an interdigital electrode configuration and a thin dielectric film. Three main flow patterns were observed in the microchannel, namely, droplet, short slug, and long slug flows. The output signal from the sensor was a real-time capacitance variation induced by the different flow patterns passing the sensing area. Experimental results give an indication of the flow patterns, due to the profile of capacitance variation. Furthermore, the identification of the flow patterns was achieved by autocorrelation of the capacitance variation and evaluation of a constant, specific for a given flow pattern in terms of linear velocity relation. This two-phase flow pattern sensor has potential to be used with other fluids, as long as they are immiscible and have very distinct dielectric properties.},

  abstract = {The early diagnosis of infectious diseases is critical because it can greatly increase recovery rates and prevent the spread of diseases such as COVID-19; however, in many areas with insufficient medical facilities, the timely detection of diseases is challenging. Conventional medical testing methods require specialized laboratory equipment and well-trained operators, limiting the applicability of these tests. Microfluidic point-of-care (POC) equipment can rapidly detect diseases at low cost. This technology could be used to detect diseases in underdeveloped areas to reduce the effects of disease and improve quality of life in these areas. This review details microfluidic POC equipment and its applications. First, the concept of microfluidic POC devices is discussed. We then describe applications of microfluidic POC devices for infectious diseases, cardiovascular diseases, tumors (cancer), and chronic diseases, and discuss the future incorporation of microfluidic POC devices into applications such as wearable devices and telemedicine. Finally, the review concludes by analyzing the present state of the microfluidic field, and suggestions are made. This review is intended to call attention to the status of disease treatment in underdeveloped areas and to encourage the researchers of microfluidics to develop standards for these devices.},

MS               2               offers significant advantages over traditional platforms in terms of test speed and control, low cost, mobility, ease-of-operation and data management. These improvements put MS               2               in a promising position in the fields of interdisciplinary basic and applied research.

  abstract = {Digital microfluidic (DMF) has emerged as one of the most popular microfluidic platforms for sample-preparation in biochemical analysis and lab-on-a-chip applications. Operated with electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) mechanism, DMF conventionally requires an external power source to provide the actuation voltage, which limited its portability and broader applications in point-of-care testing (POCT) environment. Herein, a DMF device, self-powered by triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is presented. TENG possesses a number of unique characteristics, and is very attractive to be integrated with DMF. It only requires a simple configuration with lowcost fabrication that can improve the DMF portability, but it also provides high voltage, low current output characteristics that are consistent with the EWOD actuation requirements. Basic droplet manipulations, including transportation, split, merge, dispense, and even elongate to follow the electrode patterns of alphabets, on a DMF device powered with manually-rotated Disk-TENG are demonstrated for the first time. Further, droplets con\- taining samples and reagents are transported and mixed on the programmed electrode patterns on the chip to conduct chemical reactions, including nucleic acid amplification and phenol red test, showing that Disk-TENG can serve as the power source for DMF chips in POCT applications.},

In this study, we developed a slipchip-based microfluidic system, in which sample and reagent could form two separate concentration gradients orthogonally. After sliding, samples and reagents of various concentrations could be mixed for multiplexed reactions. The performance of the developed microfluidic system was validated with food dyes and fluorescein. The reaction conditions involving {$\beta$}-galactosidase ({$\beta$}-gal) was investigated with the developed method. The solutions of 45 nM {$\beta$}-gal and 45 {$\mu$}M FDG (Fluorescein di-{$\beta$}-D-galactoside) were injected into the upper layer and lower layer of the slipchip respectively. After the formation of two concentration gradients, one-step sliding of the upper layer enabled mixing and reacting of the enzyme and the substrate with different concentrations. As a result, the amount of the reaction products increased with the increasing concentrations of substrate. At a given concentration of substrate, the amount of products rapidly reached a plateau with the increasing concentrations of enzyme. These results were consistent with those obtained using 384-well plate. This method was simple in operation with low consumption of sample and reagent, allowing rapid establishment of two orthogonal concentration gradients for multiplexed reactions.},

In digital microfluidic biochips, cross-contamination of droplets with different biomolecules is a major issue, which causes significant errors in bioassays. Washing operations are introduced to clean the cross-contamination spots. However, existing works have oversimplified assumptions on the washing behavior, which either assume infinite washing capacity, or ignore the routing conflicts between functional and washing droplets. This paper proposes the first integrated functional and washing droplet routing flow, which considers practical issues including the finite washing capacity constraint, and the routing conflicts between functional and washing droplets. Washing droplets of different sizes are also proposed to wash the congested cross-contamination spots. Effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by real-life biochemical applications.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Electrical control toolkits for microlens arrays are available to some extent, but for applications in environments with strong electromagnetic fields, radiation, or deep water, non-electrical actuation and control strategies are more appropriate. An integrated digital microfluidic zoom actuating unit with a logic addressing unit for a built-in membrane lens array, e.g., a flexible bionic compound eye, is developed and studied in this article. A concave--convex membrane fluidic microvalve, which is the component element of the logic gate, actuator, and microlens, is proposed to replace the traditional solenoid valve. The functions of pressure regulation and decoding can be obtained by incorporating microvalves into fluidic networks according to equivalent circuit designs. The zoom actuating unit contains a pressure regulator to adjust the focal length of lenses with three levels, and the logic addressing unit contains a decoder to choose a typical lens from a hexagonal lens array. The microfluidic chip control system is connected flexibly to the actuating part, a membrane lens array. It is shown from a simulation and experimental demonstration that the designed and fabricated system, which is composed of a whole microfluidic zoom unit, addressing technology, and a microlens array, works well. Because these components are constructed in the same fabrication process and operate with the same work media and driving source, the system can be made highly compatible and lightweight for applications such as human-machine interfaces and soft robots.},

  abstract = {Salmonella is a main cause of foodborne illnesses and rapid screening of Salmonella is the key to prevent Salmonella outbreaks, however available detection methods either require a long time, or need complex pretreatment, or have low sensitivity. In this study, a microfluidic biosensor was developed for Salmonella detection using viscoelastic inertial microfluidics for separating magnetic bacteria from unbound magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and enzyme catalytic colorimetry for amplifying biological signals. The polyclonal antibodies and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) modified MNPs were first used to specifically capture Salmonella to form magnetic HRP-bacteria. Both magnetic HRP-bacteria and unbound MNPs were magnetically separated from background and resuspended in viscoelastic polyvinylpyrrolidone solution as sample flow. When sample flow was injected with polyvinylpyrrolidone sheath flow into a T-shaped microchannel, larger-sized magnetic HRP-bacteria could penetrate the sample flow, however smaller-sized MNPs remained in the sample flow due to weaker inertial lift force and elastic lift force, resulting in continuous-flow separation of magnetic HRP-bacteria. Finally, magnetic HRP-bacteria were collected and concentrated to catalyze tetramethyl benzidine, and absorbance was measured to determine the bacteria. This biosensor was able to detect Salmonella as low as 30 CFU/mL in 1 h and featured the advantages of shorter time due to a one-step immunoreaction, easier extension due to only one antibody and one label, and lower cost due to less expensive materials.},

This technique can be achieved by applying a voltage to only two interdigitated and wedge-shaped electrodes: one coated with and the other without a dielectric SiO2 film. Several experimental results showed that a decrease in SiO2 thickness reduces the minimum required voltage, and that an application of square-wave voltage permits lower voltage transportation of a droplet than that of DC voltage. Also, droplet velocity depended on frequency of an applied square-wave voltage, and the velocity of a 15 {$\mu$}l deionized (DI) water droplet reached the maximum at 60 Hz.},

  abstract = {The present research investigated the voltage polarity asymmetry phenomenon based on dielectric wetting. In an ITO--hydrophobic layer--droplet setup, three reagents with different pH values (3.96, 7.0, and 10.18), two types of hydrophobic materials (AF1601 and 6\%T6), and two different thicknesses (340 nm and 2.5 {\textmu}m) of each material were systematically investigated. The results show that the thickness of the hydrophobic dielectric layer and the pH of the droplets had a significant impact on the droplet contact angle variation with the voltage. The contact angle on the thick hydrophobic dielectric layer followed the Lippmann--Young equation as the voltage changed. The angle of the thin hydrophobic dielectric layer was affected by its own properties and the type of droplet, which led to the occurrence of voltage polarity asymmetry of the electrowetting phenomenon. After further investigation of this phenomenon, it was found that it mainly accounted for the decrease in electric field strength at both ends of the droplet, which was caused by electrochemical reactions and changes in circuit resistance. The leakage current is an important indicator, and this phenomenon can be prevented by increasing the thickness of the hydrophobic dielectric layer.},

Front-end operations such as sample preparation play a pivotal role in biochemical laboratories, and in applications in biomedical engineering and life science. For fast and high-throughput biochemical applications, preparing samples of multiple target concentrations sequentially is inefficient and time-consuming. Therefore, it is critical to concurrently prepare samples of multiple target concentrations. In addition, since reagents used in biochemical reactions are expensive, reagent-saving has become an important consideration in sample preparation. Prior work in this area does not address the problem of reagentsaving and concurrent sample preparation for multiple target concentrations. In this paper, we propose the first reagent-saving mixing algorithm for biochemical samples of multiple target concentrations. The proposed algorithm not only minimizes the consumption of reagents, but it also reduces the number of waste droplets and the sample preparation time by preparing the target concentrations concurrently. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on both real biochemical experiments and synthetic test cases to demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency. Compared to prior work, the proposed algorithm can achieve up to 41\% reduction in the number of reagent droplets and waste droplets, and up to 50\% reduction in sample preparation time.},

Various coplanar electrodes are tested for contact angle changes by EWOD with a focus on the effect of the percentage gap between electrodes and are found to be in good agreement with a simple analytical model. The droplet-moving devices demonstrate the successful moving, cutting and merging of droplets ({$\sim$}0.1 {\textmu}l) in a parallel-plate configuration, i.e., between the driving plate with coplanar electrodes and the passive plate with no electrode.

So, a low-cost, easy-to-manufacture open EWOD platform is designed in this paper. In hardware platform, an operation platform is prepared by using a printed circuit board (PCB) as a substrate. The electrode shape is designed as zigzag, and its surface is optimized by organic solderability preservatives (OSP). In addition, Parafilm M and silicone oil are used as a dielectric hydrophobic layer to prepare the open platform. In software, the system program is designed by C programming language, including initialization program, serial port communication program, high-voltage output port program, and interrupt program, which can be used to drive droplets. The system can achieve an effective driving voltage of 180--240 V. The moving speed of droplets can reach 15 mm/s when the droplet volume is 1850 {\textmu}L and the electrode voltage output frequency is 10 Hz.},

The colorimetric signal during nucleic acid amplification was recorded in real-time and analyzed by a programmed smartphone without the need for complicated equipment.

However, the quantification of current methods is performed using standard curves and external references, and not direct and absolute quantification. This paper describes an integrated multiplex digital recombinase polymerase amplification (ImdRPA) microfluidic chip which combines DNA extraction, multiplex digital RPA and fluorescence detection together in one chip, creating a ``sample-in-multiplex-digital-answer-out'' system. Multi-layer soft lithography technology was used, with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as the chip material and a glass slide as the substrate. This microfluidic chip has a six-layer structure and screw microvalve control function. The sample preparation for the chip involved magnetic bead-based nucleic acid extraction, which was completed within 15 min without any instrument dependence. The dRPA region was divided into 4 regions (3 positive detection areas and 1 negative control area) and included a total of 12\,800 chambers, with each chamber being able to contain a volume of 2.7 nL. The screw valve allowed for the reaction components of each specific goal to be pre-embedded in different regions of the chambers. The reagents were passively driven into the dRPA region using vacuum-based self-priming introduction. Furthermore, we successfully demonstrated that the chip can simultaneously detect three species of pathogenic bacteria within 45 min and give digital quantitative results without the need to establish a standard curve in contaminated milk. Moreover, the detection limit of this ImdRPA microfluidic chip was found to be 10 bacterial cells for each kind of pathogen. These characteristics enhance its applicability for rapid detection of foodborne bacteria at the point-of-care (POC). We envision that the further development of this integrated chip will lead to rapid, multiplex and accurate detection of foodborne bacteria in a feasible manner.},

  abstract = {Two primary methods for electrostatically actuating microdroplets in channels currently exist: dielectrophoresis (DEP) for electrically insulating fluids and electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) for conducting fluids. In each case, a transverse electric field is used to create an electrostatic pressure, giving rise to the transport of individual liquid slugs. This paper examines the nature of the force distribution for both EWOD and DEP actuated droplets. The effects of system parameters such as contact angle and electrode length on the shape of the force density and its net integral are considered. A comparison of the scaling properties of DEP and EWOD for applications in digital microfluidics is presented. The net DEP force is shown to be strongly peaked when a droplet interface is located near the edge of a charged electrode and reduces to the well-known lumped parameter model in the appropriate limits. The effect of electrode spacing is seen to have an inversely proportional effect on the force experienced by the droplet, and the effect of increasing droplet contact angle is observed to increase the net force on the droplet.},

  abstract = {A free surface in contact with a floating object can be vertically oscillated by applying an alternating current electrowetting-on-dielectric (AC EWOD). The oscillation of the free surface generates a propelling force on the centimeter-sized floating object. This paper describes a propulsion mechanism in free-surface oscillation along with its experimental results. Flow visualizations, wave patterns measured by the free-surface synthetic schlieren method, and PIV measurements show that the oscillation generates a capillary Stokes drift on the water surface and two counter-rotating spiral underwater vortices, leading to an ejecting flow (streaming flow) normal to the wall of the boat. The momentum of the ejecting flow produces a reaction force on the wall and ultimately propels the floating boat. The propulsion speed of the boat highly depends on the amplitude, frequency, and shape of the AC EWOD signal. Curve fittings based on the Stokes drift well match the experimental measurements of propulsion speed. The width of the EWOD electrode also has significant effects on the boat speed.},

One critical problem for biochip synthesis is the droplet routing problem. Unlike traditional very large scale integration routing problems, in addition to routing path selection, the biochip routing problem needs to address the issue of scheduling droplets under practical constraints imposed by the fluidic property and timing restriction of synthesis results. In this paper, we present the first network-flow-based routing algorithm that can concurrently route a set of noninterfering nets for the droplet routing problem on biochips. We adopt a two-stage technique of global routing followed by detailed routing. In global routing, we first identify a set of noninterfering nets and then adopt the network-flow approach to generate optimal global-routing paths for nets. In detailed routing, we present the first polynomial-time algorithm for simultaneous routing and scheduling using the global-routing paths with a negotiation-based routing scheme. Our algorithm targets at both the minimization of cells used for routing for better fault tolerance and minimization of droplet transportation time for better reliability and faster bioassay execution. Experimental results show the robustness and efficiency of our algorithm.},

The optimum modification time and annealing temperature were 20 s and 210 {\textopenbullet}C, respectively. The experimental results from atomic force microscope and contact angle (CA) measurement revealed the effects of surface roughness and apparent CA on the wettability for different etch times. The multifunctionality of droplet creation, merger and transportation in the EWOD microfluidic module and sensitive electrochemical detection for the redox probe were realized simultaneously. The proposed microfabrication process has many advantages of remarkable simplicity, prominent repeatability, low cost and compatibility with standard IC processes. It shows great promise for the microsystem of the microfluidic unit and detecting cell, and gives a brilliant conception for the future fabrication of monolithic LOC integrated with functional detection.},

Current purification methods of centrifugation, column chromatography and continuous-flow techniques suffer from particle aggregation, multi-stage process, complex setups and necessary nanofabrication. These increase process costs and time, reduce efficiency and limit dynamic range. Here, we achieve an unprecedented real-time nanoparticle separation (51--1500 nm) using a large-pore (2 {$\mu$}m) deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) device. No external force fields or nanofabrication are required. Instead, we investigated innate long-range electrostatic influences on nanoparticles within a fluid medium at different NaCl ionic concentrations. In this study we account for the electrostatic forces beyond Debye length and showed that they cannot be assumed as negligible especially for precise nanoparticle separation methods such as DLD. Our findings have enabled us to develop a model to simultaneously quantify and modulate the electrostatic force interactions between nanoparticle and micropore. By simply controlling buffer solutions, we achieve dynamic nanoparticle size separation on a single device with a rapid response time ({$<$}20 s) and an enlarged dynamic range ({$>$}1200\%), outperforming standard benchtop centrifuge systems. This novel method and model combines device simplicity, isolation precision and dynamic flexibility, opening opportunities for high-throughput applications in nano-separation for industrial and biological applications.},

This technology allows user-defined droplet manipulation such as dispensing, mixing, splitting and merging, and thus the platform can be reconfigured for various assays.

Therefore, establishing a simple yet sensitive tool that can frequently assess the immune system during the course of disease and treatment is of great importance. This study introduced an integrated system that includes an electrochemical impedance spectroscope (EIS)-based biosensor in a digital microfluidic (DMF) device, to quantify the PBMC abundance with minimally trained hands. Moreover, we exploited the unique droplet manipulation feature of the DMF platform and conducted a dynamic cell capture assay, which enhanced the detection signal by 2.4-fold. This integrated system was able to detect as few as 104 PBMCs per mL, presenting suitable sensitivity to quantify PBMCs.

Phenotypic tests, such as Carba NP and blue Carba, are able to detect the resistant mechanism and provide rapid detection of carbapenemase producers to potentially guide personalized therapy. However, these tests require relatively tedious hands-on fluidic operations, and the assay format is illsuited for automation and parallelization for improved throughput. In this study, we report an automated magnetic digital microfluidics-based platform, known as DropCarba, for parallel CPGNB detection in droplets. It automates the entire carbapenemase testing process and eliminates the need for almost all hands-on fluidic operations, which ensures high consistency and minimizes human errors with a simple ``press-and-go'' operation. DropCarba was validated with a large number of bacterial isolates of various Enterobacterales species (200 strains in total with 100 CPGNB and 100 non-resistant strains) in a blinded manner, and the results agree well with the benchmark Carba NP. DropCarba, with its full automation, simple operation, reduced reagent consumption, parallelization processing, and scalable manufacturing, will greatly improve CPGNB screening and make a valuable contribution to our fight against antibiotic resistance.},

In contrast to conventional microfluidic technologies, where fluid inertia is negligible and flow remains almost within Stokes flow region with very low Reynolds number Re {$<<$}1, inertial microfluidics works in the intermediate Reynolds number range ({\textasciitilde}1 {$<$} Re {$<$} {\textasciitilde}100) between Stokes and turbulent regimes. In this intermediate range, both inertia and fluid viscosity are finite, and bring about several intriguing effects that form the basis of inertial microfluidics including: (i) inertial migration and (ii) secondary flow. Due to the superior features of high-throughput, simplicity, precise manipulation and low cost, inertial microfluidics is a very promising candidate for cellular sample processing, especially for sample with low abundant targets. In this review, we first discuss the fundamental kinematics of particles in microchannels to familiarise readers with mechanisms and underlying physics in inertial microfluidic systems. We then present a comprehensive review of recent developments and key applications of inertial microfluidic systems according to their microchannel structures. Finally, we discuss the perspective of employing fluid inertia in microfluidics for particle manipulation. Due to the superior benefits of inertial microfluidics, this promising technology will still be an attractive topic in the near future, with more novel designs and further applications in biology, medicine and industry on the horizon.},

Recently, microfluidics has been greatly developed and its influence extends not only the domains of chemical synthesis, bioanalysis and medical researches but also optics and information technology. In this review article, we will shortly discuss an enlightening analogy between electrons transport in electronics and fluids transport in microfluidic channels. This analogy helps to master transport and sorting. We will present some complex microfluidic devices showing that the analogy is going a long way off toward more complex components with impressive similarities between electronics and microfluidics. We will in particular explore the vast manifold of fluidic operations with passive and active fluidic components respectively, as well as the associated mechanisms and corresponding applications.

  abstract = {A magnetic digital microfluidic platform manipulates droplets on an open surface.           ,              A digital microfluidic platform manipulates droplets on an open surface. Magnetic digital microfluidics utilizes magnetic forces for actuation and offers unique advantages compared to other digital microfluidic platforms. First, the magnetic particles used in magnetic digital microfluidics have multiple functions. In addition to serving as actuators, they also provide a functional solid substrate for molecule binding, which enables a wide range of applications in molecular diagnostics and immunodiagnostics. Second, magnetic digital microfluidics can be manually operated in a ``power-free'' manner, which allows for operation in low-resource environments for point-of-care diagnostics where even batteries are considered a luxury item. This review covers research areas related to magnetic digital microfluidics. This paper first summarizes the current development of magnetic digital microfluidics. Various methods of droplet manipulation using magnetic forces are discussed, ranging from conventional magnetic particle-based actuation to the recent development of ferrofluids and magnetic liquid marbles. This paper also discusses several new approaches that use magnetically controlled flexible substrates for droplet manipulation. In addition, we emphasize applications of magnetic digital microfluidics in biosensing and medical diagnostics, and identify the current limitations of magnetic digital microfluidics. We provide a perspective on possible solutions to close these gaps. Finally, the paper discusses the future improvement of magnetic digital microfluidics to explore potential new research directions.},

  abstract = {As more micro- and nanofluidic methodologies are developed for a growing number of diverse applications, it becomes increasingly apparent that the choice of substrate material can have a profound effect on the eventual performance of a device. This is due mostly to the high surface-to-volume ratio that exists within such small structures. In addition to the obvious limitations related to the choice of solvent, operating temperatures, and pressure, the method of fluidic pumping---in particular, an electrokinetics-based methodology using a combination of electro-osmotic and electrophoresis flows---can further complicate material choice. These factors, however, are only part of the problem; once chemicals or biological materials (e.g., proteins or cells) are introduced into a microfluidic system, surface characteristics will have a profound influence on the activity of such components, which will subsequently influence their performance. This article reviews the common types of materials that are currently used to fabricate microfluidic devices and considers how these materials may influence the overall performance associated with chemical and biological processing.},

First, the types of microvalves in PCR chips are discussed, including active and passive microvalves. The active microvalves are subdivided into mechanical (thermopneumatic and shape memory alloy), non-mechanical (hydrogel, sol--gel, paraffin, and ice), and external (modular built-in, pneumatic, and non-pneumatic) microvalves. The passive microvalves also include mechanical (in-line polymerized gel and passive plug) and non-mechanical (hydrophobic) microvalves. The review then discusses mechanical (piezoelectric, pneumatic, and thermopneumatic) and non-mechanical (electrokinetic, magnetohydrodynamic, electrochemical, acoustic-wave, surface tension and capillary, and ferrofluidic magnetic) micropumps in PCR chips. Next, different micromixers within PCR chips are presented, including passive (Y/T-type flow, recirculation flow, and drop) and active (electrokinetically-driven, acoustically-driven, magnetohydrodynamical-driven, microvalves/pumps) micromixers. Finally, general discussions on microvalves, micropumps, and micromixers for PCR chips are given. The microvalve/micropump/micromixers allow high levels of PCR chip integration and analytical throughput.},

The GenMark Dx ePlex investigational use only blood culture identification fungal pathogen panel (BCID-FP) rapidly detects 15 fungal targets simultaneously in blood culture samples positive for fungi by Gram staining. We aimed to determine the performance of the BCID-FP in a multicenter clinical study. Blood culture samples collected at 10 United States sites and tested with BCID-FP at 4 sites were compared to the standard-of-care microbiological and biochemical techniques, fluorescence in situ hybridization using peptide nucleic acid probes (PNAFISH) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization--time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Discrepant results were analyzed by bi-directional PCR/ sequencing of residual blood culture samples. A total of 866 clinical samples, 120 retrospectively and 21 prospectively collected, along with 725 contrived samples were evaluated. Sensitivity and specificity of detection of Candida species (C. albicans, C. auris, C. dubliniensis, C. famata, C. glabrata, C. guilliermondii, C. kefyr, C. krusei, C. lusitaniae, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis) ranged from 97.1 to 100\% and 99.8 to 100\%, respectively. For the other organism targets, sensitivity and specificity were as follows: 100\% each for Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii, 98.6\% and 100\% for Fusarium spp., and 96.2\% and 99.9\% for Rhodotorula spp., respectively. In 4 of the 141 clinical samples, the BCID-FP panel correctly identified an additional Candida species, undetected by standard-of-care methods. The BCID-FP panel offers a faster turnaround time for identification of fungal pathogens in positive blood cultures that may allow for earlier antifungal interventions and includes C. auris, a highly multidrug-resistant fungus.},

  abstract = {Abstract             State-of-the-art microfluidic systems rely on relatively expensive and bulky off-chip infrastructures. The core of a system---the microfluidic chip---requires a clean room and dedicated skills to be fabricated. Thus, state-of-the-art microfluidic systems are barely accessible, especially for the do-it-yourself (DIY) community or enthusiasts. Recent emerging technology---3D-printing---has shown promise to fabricate microfluidic chips more simply, but the resulting chip is mainly hardened and single-layered and can hardly replace the state-of-the-art Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chip. There exists no convenient fluidic control mechanism yet suitable for the hardened single-layered chip, and particularly, the hardened single-layered chip cannot replicate the pneumatic valve---an essential actuator for automatically controlled microfluidics. Instead, 3D-printable non-pneumatic or manually actuated valve designs are reported, but their application is limited. Here, we present a low-cost accessible all-in-one portable microfluidic system, which uses an easy-to-print single-layered 3D-printed microfluidic chip along with a novel active control mechanism for fluids to enable more applications. This active control mechanism is based on air or gas interception and can, e.g., block, direct, and transport fluid. As a demonstration, we show the system can automatically control the fluid in microfluidic chips, which we designed and printed with a consumer-grade 3D-printer. The system is comparably compact and can automatically perform user-programmed experiments. All operations can be done directly on the system with no additional host device required. This work could support the spread of low budget accessible microfluidic systems as portable, usable on-the-go devices and increase the application field of 3D-printed microfluidic devices.},

  abstract = {Reducing droplet/solid interfacial sliding resistance directly by applied voltage is still a scientific challenge. In this paper, the droplet/solid interfacial stick-slip behaviors were studied under different slew rates using an electrowettingon-dielectric device. Results showed that the slip amplitude and slip times of the triple contact line were significant changed by voltage slew rate signals. The triple contact line slipped at least eight times before saturation at 1 V/s, however, it slipped five and three times at 10 V/s and 50 V/s respectively. The slip amplitude increased by a factor of four when the voltage slew rate increased from 1 V/s to 50 V/s. Dynamics analysis indicated that the large slip amplitude was caused by inertia effect under high voltage slew rate. Moreover, the energy dissipation mechanisms transited from viscous dissipation to molecular friction dissipation with increasing of voltage slew rate. Results revealed that the sliding resistance decreased directedly by applied direct current voltage. Consequently, the droplet/solid interfacial sticky behaviors caused by applied voltage can be decreased without external setups, which is helpful for miniaturizing and integrating of microfluidic setups. Furthermore, the findings extend the understanding of the droplet/solid interfacial stick-slip mechanisms under applied voltage.},

Basic operations such as droplet dispensing, mixing, dilution, localized heating, and incubation can be carried out using a 2-D array of electrodes and nanoliter volumes of liquid. The number of independent input pins used to control the electrodes in such microfluidic ``biochips'' is an important cost-driver, especially for disposable printed circuit board devices that are being developed for clinical and point-of-care diagnostics. However, most prior work on biochip design-automation has assumed independent control of the electrodes using a large number of input pins. We present a broadcast-addressing-based design technique for pin-constrained multifunctional biochips. The proposed method provides high throughput for bioassays and it reduces the number of control pins by identifying and connecting control pins with ``compatible'' actuation sequences. We also describe two scheduling methods to map fluidic operations on the pin-constrained design, in order to minimize the completion time while avoiding pinactuation conflicts. The proposed methods are evaluated using multifunctional chips designed to execute a set of multiplexed bioassays, the polymerase chain reaction, and a protein dilution assay.},

However, most prior work on pin-constrained biochip design considers droplet routing and the assignment of pins to electrodes as independent problems. We propose an integer linear programming (ILP)based optimization method to solve the droplet-routing and the pin-mapping design problems concurrently. The proposed co-optimization method optimizes routing pathways, generates a single pin-assignment, and attempts to minimize the number of control pins. It also overcomes a major limitation of recent work on this problem---the method described in prior work can lead to infeasible designs due to the need to change the mapping of pins to electrodes dynamically during bioassay execution. The effectiveness of the proposed co-optimization method is demonstrated for a commercial biochip that is used to perform n-plex immunoassays, as well as an experimental chip for multiplexed in-vitro diagnostics.},

We propose a droplet-routing method that avoids cross-contamination in the optimization of droplet flow paths. The proposed approach targets disjoint droplet routes and synchronizes wash-droplet routing with functional droplet routing, in order to reduce the duration of droplet routing while avoiding the cross-contamination between different droplet routes. In order to avoid cross-contamination between successive routing steps, an optimization technique is used to minimize the number of wash operations that must be used between successive routing steps. Two real-life biochemical applications are used to evaluate the proposed droplet-routing methods.},

  abstract = {This paper describes highly efficient in-droplet particle concentration and separation where particles are concentrated and separated into droplets by traveling-wave dielectrophoresis (DEP) and subsequent electrowetting-on-dielectric droplet splitting. A successful concentration for 5-{\textmu}m aldehyde sulfate (AS) latex particles was experimentally achieved using microfabricated devices, showing that 98\% of the total particles were concentrated into a split daughter droplet. In addition, in-droplet particle separation was successfully achieved using the following two different cases of particle mixtures: case 1) a mixture of 5-{\textmu}m AS latex beads and 8-{\textmu}m glass beads; and case 2) a mixture of ground pine (GP) spores and 8-{\textmu}m glass beads. In case 1), 97\% of the total AS beads were separated into one split droplet and 77\% of the total glass beads into the other split droplet. In case 2), over 92\% of the GP spores were separated into a split daughter droplet, whereas 86\% of the glass beads were separated into the other split daughter droplet. In all these concentration and separation experiments, the applied frequency and the conductivity medium are key parameters influencing the concentration and separation performance, which have been optimally determined by measuring the DEP and electrorotation spectra of the used particles prior to the concentration and separation experiments. This integrated in-droplet separation and concentration method may provide an additional functionality to digital microfluidics.},

To reduce product cost for disposable biochips, testing steps and functional fluidic operations must be implemented on pin-constrained designs. However, previous testing methods for pin-constrained designs do not optimize test schedules to reduce the number of control pins and test/assay completion time. We propose a pin-count-aware online testing method for pin-constrained designs to support the execution of both fault testing and the target bioassay protocol. The proposed method interleaves fault testing with the target bioassay protocol for online testing. It is aimed at significantly reducing the completion time for testing and for the bioassay, while keeping the number of control pins small. Two practical applications, namely a multiplexed bioassay and an interpolation-based mixing protocol, are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, most prior work on pinconstrained biochip design considers droplet routing and the assignment of pins to electrodes as independent problems. In this paper, we propose optimization methods to solve the droplet routing and pin-constrained design problems concurrently. First, we formulate the co-optimization problem involving droplet routing and pin-mapping. Next, we present an integer linear programming-based optimization method to solve the dropletrouting and the pin-mapping design problems concurrently. The proposed co-optimization method minimizes the number of control pins. We also present an efficient heuristic approach to tackle the co-optimization problem. These methods overcome a major drawback of a recently proposed method, which leads to infeasible solutions involving conflicts in the mapping of pins to electrodes in different droplet-routing stages. The effectiveness of the proposed co-optimization method is demonstrated for two commercial biochips and an experimental university chip for multiplexed in-vitro diagnostics.},

  abstract = {A digital microfluidic biochip (DMB) is an attractive platform for automating laboratory procedures in microbiology. To overcome the problem of cross-contamination due to fouling of the electrode surface in traditional DMBs, a contactless liquidhandling biochip technology, referred to as acoustofluidics, has recently been proposed. A major challenge in operating this platform is the need for a control signal of frequency 24 MHz and voltage range {\textpm}10/ {\textpm} 20 V to activate the inter-digitaltransducer (IDT) units in the biochip. A preliminary solution based on amplifiers, mechanical relays, and jump wires introduces signal loss (at least 6dB), signal coupling, and waveform distortion. In this paper, we present a new IDT-driver design that offers three major advantages: smaller form factor and lower cost, effective and high-quality signal generation and transmission, and fully-automated and flexible biochip control. Experimental demonstrations of droplet routing and a simple bioassay highlight the effectiveness of our hardware design.},

ITO substrate electrodes with various patterns are fabricated, ensuring the shape of the formed liquid column matches the pattern. Leveraging the principles of heat transfer, the temperature of the polymer droplet is regulated via a heating stage to enable targeted heating of defined shapes and areas.

  abstract = {A significant growth of research on digital microfluidics has been achieved over the past several decades, and the field is still attracting increasing attention for fulfilling relevant mechanisms and potential applications. Numerous studies have been devoted to actively manipulating droplets in a variety of fundamental and applicational scenarios. In this work, the deformation of ferromagnetic fluid droplets is studied under an external uniform magnetic field. The droplets are precisely dispersed on the bottom surface of a container assembled with polymer methacrylate (PMMA) plates. Mineral oil is applied instead of air as the surrounding medium for easy stretching and preventing water solvent evaporation in ferrofluid. The design and processing of the container are firstly carried out to observe the shape and characterize the wettability of the droplets in the immiscible mineral oil medium. Furthermore, the droplets' deformation and the working mechanism are given under the action of the horizontal uniform magnetic field. At different magnetic field intensities, the droplet is stretched in the horizontal direction parallel to the applied field. Due to volume conservation, the dimension in the height reduces correspondingly. With the coupling effect of magnetic force, viscous force and interfacial tension, the contact angle first increases with the magnetic field and then basically remains unchanged upon magnetization saturation. Consistent with the experimental results, the numerical method clearly reveals the field coupling mechanism and the nonlinear deformation of the sessile droplet.},

  abstract = {To explore genome mutation meaningfully, it is in urgent need to develop an automated and inexpensive platform for DNA mutation analysis. Digital microfluidics is a powerful platform for a broad range of applications due to the advantages of high automatization and low reagent consumption. Pyrosequencing enables DNA sequencing based on non-electrophoresis bioluminescence, which is suitable for rapid and sensitive analysis of short sequences. Herein, we describe a palmtop sequencing platform for automatic, real-time and portable analysis of DNA mutations, which is based on the pyrosequencing principle and implemented by digital microfluidics. The portable system can sequence a DNA template with up to 53 bp with 100\% accuracy within 2 h. Mutation in the KRAS gene can be detected within 30 min with a LOD as low as 5\% mutant level. Portable and accurate gender identification was further demonstrated by sequencing a short amelogenin fragment. With the advantages of portability, ease of use, high accuracy, and low cost, the palmtop sequencing platform shows great potential for portable genetic testing in a variety of circumstances.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the number of interdisciplinary research works related to the development of miniaturized systems with integrated chemical and biological analyses is increasing. Digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) are one kind of miniaturized systems designed for conducting inexpensive, fast, convenient and reliable biochemical assay procedures focusing on basic scientific research and medical diagnostics. The role of a dielectric layer in the digital microfluidic biochips is prominent as it helps in actuating microliter droplets based on the electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) technique. The advantages of using three different material layers of dielectric such as parafilm, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) were reported in the current work. A simple fabrication process of a digital microfluidic device was performed and good results were obtained. The threshold of the actuation voltage was determined for all dielectric materials of varying thicknesses. Additionally, the OpenDrop device was tested by utilizing a single-plate system to transport microliter droplets for a bioassay operation. With the newly proposed fabrication methods, these dielectric materials showed changes in contact angle and droplet velocity when the actuation voltage was applied. The threshold actuation voltage for the dielectric layers of 10--13 {\textmu}m was 190 V for the open plate DMFBs.},
